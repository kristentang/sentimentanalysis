"I have fine, but stubborn hair. It naughts up like no other and gets very dry and brittle after combing. I've combed it wet, dry, whatever - it was unmanageable! For months I've heard that the Wet Brush is the way to go and that it'll comb through naughts softly, leaving your hair perfectly smooth. Finally I broke down and got one. It is by far the best brush I've ever owned. I hope that I can grow my hair out longer than my shoulders, now that I have a brush that gives me naught-free hair. I don't even have to brush my hair in the morning if I brushed it the night before; this brush leaves my hair so soft and light. So happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!",5
"it do just what the commercial say, only problem my sister have is when she rinse it of water do get in the bush and she got to shake it out.",4
"This product was reviewed by a 62 year old woman. The pen was easy to apply, the serum that came out was gel like and while was a good moisturizer, after several weeks of diligent use the wrinkles were not visibly reduced and I think that is the biggest claim this product makes and the whole point of the product. It's awful expensive for just a moisturizer.",2
"What an amazing set!! The polishes are so pigmented which is why this set is perfect for stamping... The polish has a stronger smell than other brands, but for the amount & quality I get for the price, I don't mind :)",5
I bought this for my daughter in her dorm.  We love that it's organic and unscented with a handy pump.  I will buy the refill next time around.  Highly recommend and will buy again.,5
"I tend to buy more makeup artist line eye shadows but I freelanced for Lancome and they have decent eye shadows, they have nice pigment and color",3
i did not received my item . would have really like a new one but was too afraid to try my luck and it might get lost again.,1
"Using this brush with argan oil is a great way to smooth curly, dry hair that tends to frizz easily.It goes through wet hair easily, the barrel design allows good air flow and heats to speed drying. The base of the brush part where it meets the handle doesn't grab hair. Not even my fine straight hair.For my waist length, straight hair, drying was a lot faster, and combined with argan oil- my hair looked very shiny. Curling the ends was beyond my dexterity though. It's not really designed for people like me who have fairly smooth hair.My daughter on the other hand has hair that tends to be dry, it's very thick and a bit coarse, and full of loose curls and waves that fluff and frizz at nearly any change in the weather. It's shoulder length and she has tried so many things to get it as smooth as she prefers. Her preferred hair style is smooth with the ends curled either up in a flip or under in an all one length bobbed cut.This works great on her hair. I'll continue using it for those rare times that I blow out my hair, but she's going to use the brush regularly. It just does the job easily, and leaves her with the nice, smooth, non-frizzy or fluffy style she likes in a lot less time with less damage than drying and using a straightening iron.",5
This hair lotion is very light and smells great. Your scalp's pores will not be clogged which causes lots of itching and dandruff. The real key to this lotion working successfully on your hair and scalp is to use it daily.,4
"If you want to experiment with peel yourself, try this product. It's really nice and it gets the results. I put it on my face every weekend for a few months and I still have like  of a bottle left. It doesn't take much but it does the work. Don't expect miracles, though. This is very gently (if you do it right) so it is very good for use ""at home"". If you want a cosmetic, dramatic results, go to a spa and pay $300.",5
"I bought this product in February and just started using it on Sunday, April 3. I am currently on day 5 and while I look completely hideous (I mean it in the worst possible way), I can see a lot of improvements. This experience hasn't been fun. I have a full ""Peel Diary"" on my blog if anyone is interested on hearing all the details of the peel. I hope someone finds it helpful.[...]For those who don't want to read all of it, I will post the final review as it happens.  I bought the 25% peel by the way, and not the 20%. Woopsies.***It is now Day 9 and I have to say I am very happy with the results! I had a few days of pure misery (to say the least) BUT everything has improved and continues to improve daily!If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through my blog. I will be happy to answer any questions. Thanks!!",4
I have super thick hair and for years ive strugled with tangles. This brush helps sooo much! Glides right through! Wish it was a little less bulky but i love it! Also love the hair mask that came with it!,4
"I've used this weekly for the past four weeks, and while it does brighten my hair and make it shine, it also discolors everything it touches before it is rinsed out.  That includes skin around my hairline, my hands and the bottom of the shower floor if not continually running the water while waiting the two or three minutes recommended on the bottle.With that said, this product does do what it promises.  Adds brightening color and shine.  But, because I have to scrub my skin several times to remove the staining from my hands - I probably will not be buying this product.",3
"After reading the product reviews online I was a little frightened about this product, but after I got it yesterday, I put it together which I must say was quite easy (I didn't even need the instructions), I ran it for about 45 mins, letting it air dry and removing all the water. It seems to work quite well, I play with the vent, marked the water tank to the full mark with a sharper, check for any leaks",3
It looks chalky and came damaged. Horrible packing unless mine was previously opened. Perhaps I will use it mixing it with another more moisturizing balm because this lipstick seems dry. I will not be buying any more of this brand. It was cheap and I guess I shouldn't expect much from it to begin with... My bad.,1
Loved this body wash. There are many body washes that make my skin even more dry than it already is. This one made my skin soft ! overall I loved this product,5
"these just sparkle like you can't imagine, very easy to apply and wonderful over other colors or on their own, very happy with them",5
"I color my hair and with styling my hair everyday, my hair goes through it. This product keeps my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.Love this product.",5
I have Interstitial Cystitis an most over the counter pain relievers burn. This one doesn't.. I don't know why just know that it doesn't.. I use it and it works well for pms.. Headaches and cramps,5
This is the BEST mascara out there. Stays great and makes my eyes look amazing. Such a great price...love e.l.f.!,5
"I have used this serum during my morning facial routine.  I have used several other products and then stopped in order to be able to see the difference this makes on my face.The biggest difference that I have noticed is that my face is not as dry as it normally is.  I was excited because of the Vitamin C and how it promises brighter, more youthful looking skin, but I was not expecting the serum to keep my face as moisturized as it has.  I expect with even more use that I will see some of my fine lines diminish, but I am happy with the results after one week.It only takes a few drops to make a difference in your skin!",4
"This is my 3rd one of this model (long story, but the others didn't fail).  I have had the same positive experience with each of them.  Really not sure why the negative reviews.1.  It's a higher wattage than most of the others.  That made a huge difference for me.  The noise wasn't as high pitched, didn't sound like it was working as hard, curled better.  I also tried the Revlon 1200 watt sister to this product.  This one is definitely more powerful.  I never heard the high-pitch noises others complained about--with any of the 3.2.  Large brush.  I have only used the large brush.  I have long, medium thickness, fine hair.  The bristles hold my hair nicely while I curl and dry it.  My hair does NOT curl around things easily.  It even flips out of some curling irons.  The bristles kept the hair against the brush nicely.  The other thing to note is that the barrel is one continuous piece of metal.  Some barrels (like the smaller one in this set) have sections that come together to form angled curves.  This leaves my hair kind of kinky and shows bends where the hair was against seams.  The big barrel/brush doesn't do this since it is all one piece.  I cannot speak to the smaller brush.3.  Smaller brush.  While I have not used this brush, it does have a unique feature that may appeal to some:  If you twist it, the size of the barrel changes from small to a bit larger.  In essence, you can adjust the size of the barrel to various sizes.  Kind of a neat touch.4.  Dryer attachment.  Haven't used.5.  Settings - nice assortment for an inexpensive dryer.  High (hot), low (hot), cool (a high setting)Two cautions:-  If you have long hair, be cautious not to let the vents at the base suck your hair in.  It causes an awful burning-hair smell and made one of mine less powerful (#1 back to the store)-  Don't drop a brush.  The brushes secure onto the body with a notch.  I dropped one on our tile floor and it broke the notch.  No way to use the brush if you cannot attach it to the base.  (#2 down the drain)If you aren't sure about it, they sell it at Site-to-Store function online at Walmart.  Super easy to return if it isn't what you like.",4
"The bottle says that you can use Motions Marula Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil and then style your hair as normal. I expect that that would only work for a select few people. This oil leaves your hair with such a wet, oily look and feel that most people will want/need to wash their hair after using this product. It's like putting baby oil on your hair.Personally, I didn't care for the aroma of the marula oil.Ideally, I'd say that this product is best used prior to washing your hair, especially if you're having problems with a dry scalp. It definitely moisturizes your hair and provides extra shine.I will say that my hair did look great after using the product. It had a luxuriant, healthy look and feel.",3
"We have always used Banana Boat sunscreens.  Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion does not disappoint.  It does a great job of protecting the skin from a burn, especially at the pool.  The scent is subtle and it goes on nicely.  It does not feel sticky and does not irritate the skin.  I would recommend if you have a problem with dry skin and want a daily sunscreen.  I do recommend a sunscreen stick for the face and not this product as it does run into the eyes and sting, but I find that with most lotion based sunscreens.  A+",5
"I received this product for consideration through Tomoson and I like the idea of using a natural exfoliant rather than something more harsh such as a face scrub. My face feels smooth after using it, but I have yet to notice any dramatic results or anything. I will say that I also feel like I have to use less facial cleanser when I use it with this facial sponge so that is nice and seems more economical as well. Overall pleased.",4
i love this cover stick the price is amazing and it helps cover up my dark circles and you can use it as an eyeshadow or you can use it as a blush.,5
"Although I did receive this product for free, I believe that it is worth every red cent because it really does work!",5
I got this for a friend of mine in france I hope she likes it.  Im sure she will.  I love opi and its a real pretty color.,5
I loooveeee this body wash!! I had not used herbal essences since the 90s and I forgot how fabulous it smells!! This has a pretty light scent that is both sweet and light rose :) it lathers great and a little goes a long way! And at a steal of a price! The scent is lasting after use.. Better than my more expensive body washes! Highly reccommend and I will be purchasing more!! :),5
"This is an awesome product and much better than the expensive hot oil treatments you buy.  You will love it! It is not runny and it will do exactly what it says it will.  It will condition your scalp, strengthen your hair and your hair will be shiny and healthy.",5
"What a god-send this is. I have highlighted my hair for 12 years and always used salon products, hair professionally done, never used junk anything because I always said if you pay to go salon why go cheap on products and tools to basically wipe out your $100 dye job. Well about a year ago I went all dark brown, from blonde, hated it and went back to blonde in stages shortly after. My hair was never the same. Very dry and brittle and had to cut my hair often to keep the yuck off. My hair stylist and I tried everything and nothing was working. Ever since I started using this it's like my hair is softer , silkier and not breaking. Looks like my normal healthy hair again. I used every other wash for a week in replace of conditioner. It never weighs me down nor feels greasy or thick. Love love love this. Worth the money a little goes a long way.",5
"Okay, I'm a Wen Girl...  This product is pretty darn close!  And it is less expensive.  The fragrance isn't as enticing as the Wen, but it is pleasant.  The manageability of your hair isn't as good, I have fly-aways with this.  But it cleans, conditions and softens just as well as the Wen.  And it costs a third of what Wen does!  Yes, I will buy this again and again, but I'll keep a jar of the Wen for weekly luxury!  :)",4
"I've always thought it was kind of strange when people complained about certain products not having instructions on them. I once reviewed a salad spinner, and several of the other reviewers complained about no instructions in the box and not being able to get the salad spinner to work. I thought to myself ""What's next? Do we need instructions to use mixing bowls and water pitchers as well?""Even with the shampoo and conditioner from this product line, I didn't understand the complaints of no instructions. The use of shampoo and conditioner is pretty much standard fare; if they don't have instructions assume a nickel sized amount and use daily or as needed. With this product however, instructions would've been nice. Something simple, indicating the amount of product to use and how often to use the product; I don't think that would be too much to ask.As for the product itself, I personally have not had much luck in finding the exact amount that I need. If I use too little, I don't notice any difference in my hair. If I use too much, my hair does have a shine, but it's not a ""clean"" shine, it looks like a dirty, oily hair shine. Overall, I don't think I'll finish the tube, and I certainly won't purchase another.",3
"Here is my thorough review of this product.  This is coming from a woman who has sensitive, combination, multiple-ethnicity skin, who lives in varying climates.  My skin demands much of my attention, so I try tons of products to see what I'm allergic to and not.  My skin is also dry yet oily, endures dry, cold Colorado weather and hot, humid Georgia climates.  I have the fragile, pale delicacy of Japanese skin, with the large pores and wrinkle prone American side thrown in.  Now let's get to this product.Neutrogena Night Serum claims to fight wrinkles by helping to moisturize and infusing your skin with retinol.  Now I'm still a young woman, so I bought this mostly to prevent future wrinkles, fight the fine lines I currently have from all the sun and winter winds I deal with daily, to help balance my combination skin, and to even out my skin tone since every flaw shows up on my light complexion.PROS:- decent sized bottle for the price (use nightly for up to 2 months)- easy to use pump (a single pump is enough for one night's use)- almost no scent- goes on smooth and even- doesn't cause acne (as long as you blend evenly)- perfectly safe for my skin (which is allergic to pretty much everything)- keeps my face moisturized all night- mixes well with serums without reacting (such as 100% hyalauric acid or vitamin c)- the retinol is a nice addition to your nightly moisturizer- safe to use close to your eyes/on your eyelids without causing a reactionCONS:- bottle warns you will feel a warm, tingling sensation (yes, yes you will, because it feels like a 30 second sunburn that slowly ebbs and turns your skin flush red)- haven't seen permanent differences in my fine wrinkles over time, but in the mornings my face is brighter, clearer, and more plump than when I go without- leaves my skin oily the next morning until I wash it, so I highly recommend using it at night only and never as a daytime serum under makeup- is a little intense in humid weather, and will cause acne if you don't blend thoroughly- is a little too dry in windy and cold weather, and needs an additional face cream on top to prevent drying over the course of the night- not entirely a con, but the serum has pearlescent sparkles (it won't fall into your eyes or irritate your contact lens, but it will make your black towels/robe/pajamas a little sparkly over time)OVERALL:I'd buy it again.  I don't think it's very useful to use alone, but I like using it as part of my 5-Step Japanese Skincare Routine (foam cleanser, toner, serum, eye cream, face cream or lotion).  I only use it at night as instructed, simply because it does make my face red and tingly and would make me look sunburned during the daytime.  This tingling isn't the most pleasant feeling, but the bottle claims it means this is working.  I don't know to trust that, or assume it's a coverup for some flaw in the recipe.  But I have yet to see a downside to using this as a longterm preventative for fine wrinkles.  It's suitable for people of different ethnicities, with sensitive skin, in different climates.",4
"I am naturally fair skinned with auburn hair. The sun is traditionally my enemy. So before I go somewhere warm I try to develop a base tan to prevent 3rd degree beach burns. I love Paint in Black. For the price you can't beat the results. I have developed a nice, subtle base tan with no burning. The lotion moisturizes well and smells good. When I leave the tanner I don't seem to have that tanner smell that so many lotions leave in their wake. Overall, I think this is a fantastic tanning lotion.",4
Nice little due here.  Thicken the lashes and eye cream and you can't go wrong with OLAY.  I absolutely love it!,5
"When I first got this cap, I really liked it because it was so cute and functional.  Now I am disappointed.  The design has flaked off, for the most part, so it looks tacky.  It still does the job and keeps my hair nice and dry, but I am disappointed.",3
Made my hair feel sticky and gross. I don't know what's wrong with this thing. Would never buy or use again.,1
"This product barely made a difference for my faded hair. I followed the instructions, and first of all, after applying it, my hair felt very dry and brittle. I had to add special conditioning oils, and even so, my hair looked pretty damaged. (Yes, it was a little fried to start with, but it was worse after this treatment, even considering I used &#34;Fekkai Prx Oil&#34; (found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EYZY5VC).The color difference was so slight, I didn't notice it at first. Too subtle. My hair still looks pretty faded, so I guess I'll just have to dye it again. This product isn't worth it, and I would not recommend that anyone buy it. One good thing is the scent--very nice and clean.",3
What a wonderful shampoo and fragrance. Both my wife and I have fully enjoyed this product and how it leaves our hair so soft and silky. It has a rich lather with such a small amount of the shampoo.We will definitely be buying more of this in the future.,5
My husband usually uses Nivea for men maximum hydration lotion.  He really likes the silky feeling it gives his skin.  So Vaseline had a big hurdle to clear if they wanted to make an impression.  The final verdict?  The Vaseline men's skin care lotion is pretty good.  Good enough that he likes them both for different reasons.  He prefers the way Nivea feels going on and the way his skin feels for the first few hours after its application.  But he prefers the way his skin feels five plus hours later with the Vaseline lotion.  He has no preference with the scents.  His solution is to alternate between the two.,5
"I just ordered this shampoo from Amazon.com, but I will not be accepting the package. Beware!!! It states that shipping will be five dollars and some change but they're charging twenty dollars instead. I will not be ordering from Target again.",1
"This product is a bit runny, which means it is easy to smooth through hair.  Unfortunately, it also means that it doesn't have enough weight to keep hair from frizzing.  In the high humidity area in which I live, I noticed small, flyaway curls almost immediately after application to damp hair.  Styling didn't help.  This did work as a detangler on damp hair with no ill effects.  It didn't work wonders in any sense, and I don't see it becoming a regular part of my hair care routine.  Also, it smells like coconut suntan lotion, so if you don't care for that smell this is absolutely NOT for you.",3
"Being of Irish descent, I cannot really get tan. I try sometimes, but that usually fails. I thought I'd give this a try to see what would happen.This product is easy to use. It doesn't get on my sheets and I took care to make sure it didn't get on my clothes. I can also safely say it didn't streak, but that's also because it didn't really work for me.Other reviewers have said that this has worked for them. The fact that it didn't work for me shouldn't condemn the product entirely. But I didn't get a visible glow with it and that's important to divulge.",2
"Initially I didn't care for the medicinal smell, but you get used to it and the smell dies down a while after use. My cuticles look and feel much better.",4
This is what I have been looking for!  My hair is glossy and looks so much better.  I brush now every night just like in the old days.  Wonderful brush -- love it!,5
Love this! I love the smell and it makes my hair SOOOO soft. It has definitely helped with making my hair less dry and stringy.,4
but they fall apart and you have to go through too many to consider them functional.  I wouldn't recommend them.,2
Warmth puts a natural glow on your face. I have tried other mineral make up before & nothing compares to this! I love it!,5
"I love this scent. I first received it as a gift, and just ordered some more of it. I do use it as a body spray and have just recently began using it as a hair perfume. It is hard to find anything that smells this good for your hair! And, it is just wonderful. Highly recommend this scent and will continue using it every day.",5
"The one thing I couldn't live without in my beauty arsenal is this dry shampoo. I wash my hair no more than twice a week and haven't ever had trouble with greasy, oiliy hair. I have very straight, limp hair, but live in Texas and love that big Dallas hair. As a working girl, I found myself washing only my bangs, because I didn't want to loose volume with washing, but still wanted to look polished. This dry shampoo has resolved all my hair issues. It adds volume, keeps my hair ready for styling, and smells great. I get complimented on my hair all the time and have even been asked to show a group of women my perfect ponytail secret, which is simply this spray. If overused, you will get a white powder, but blondes don't have to worry about that. Just spray it around the crown of your head and at the base of the roots. A bottle usually lasts me 2 months and I use it almost every other day to maintain the volume that I like. I don't know how any other Texas woman can last through the summer without this!",5
"ive used it one night only but realized ive got some pimples on my cheeks.i will be trying a few more days, but i agree with some reviewers. its texture is really thickand it feels really dry when you apply it . so far not so impressed... :(( One day after !  )i found out that its better to apply this one first right after you wash face, and then apply other products.feels weird putting cream right away.. but it worked better !",2
"We started with this and later incorporated Dr. Bronners Tea Tree Soap which we now use for shampoo, body & face wash.  We add this to water bottles to clean with or to the laundry.  Great Stuff!btw my daughter bought some BeeBee (sp?) &#34;hair tonic&#34; from the salon for $21 and I tried it and what do you know?  smelled like tea tree oil!  sure enough, 1st ingredient!",5
"The first day I used this in 70-80+ degree weather with bright sun I came back browner just like I used no sunblock at all. And today the 2nd day of a really bright hot day I'm even more darker, really dark, just like I didnt use any sunblock again. And I put on A LOT. Since it didnt work the first time I used it. And that's just from riding inside a car with tinted back windows most of the day. It's not working at all. Plus it goes on so thick and pastey white that I have to wipe my arms off some first and then try and get it off my palms.Im now looking for non natural sunscreen or atleast a stronger higher SPF. 50-80+ SPF",1
The shades are realllly pretty and last for a long time. its perfect for the price. I love L'Oreal products.,5
"As soon as I received this oil I automatically smelled it to see if it smelt of burnt ashes, and surprisingly I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled good. I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft. I haven't seen any growth yet but I'm sure I will.I recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.",5
"When my hair was long, I'd use conditioner to keep it tangle free.  Now, I just like how my hair feels after I use it.  Neutragena Triple Moisture conditioner makes my hair feel light and healthy and easier to comb through.  It's thicker than most conditioners that come in a bottle.  Maybe that's why this one comes in a tube.  The sweet almond scent is sophisticated, not trendy, and I don't find it overpowering.  I bought the 3-pack on Amazon and have not been disappointed.",4
"I first tried this as a gift with purchase.  It is a small bottle containing a clear serum.  You apply a small amount to your face at night, then follow with your mositurizer. It is odorless and a little goes a long way.Initially, I noticed nothing. However after four weeks for religious use and by that I mean I did not miss a single night,the difference was amazing.  There was marked refinement in skin tone and texture, reduction of pores.  Additionallhy, my skins is softer.This product is a good investment if used as directed.  Although the cost may seem prohibitive, the serum lasts a really long time (not something you will be replacing monthly) and the results, healthier,smoother more beautiful skin, justify the expense.",4
"I had issues with other caps where they would ride around my head all night and I'd find myself having to pull them back into place or wake up in the morning with it almost completely off. Then when I bought ones more snug, they were so snug, they became too uncomfortable to sleep in. THIS cap fits perfect! I was also able to easily hand wash this cap (or machine wash it with my laundry) each time I washed my hair (which is recommended). This cap stays in place and does so with comfort. I would certainly recommend this purchase.",4
i guess i like this because i felt something hot and tinkly and i thought n figured something had  to be working but was it of course not my imagination didnt loose an inch off of this gut not even working out my imagination loved it though so 3 stars it is,3
"Bought two kinds and this is by far better than the other bottle. Great price, great product. Great for hydration.",5
"I love a thick Shea Body Butter, and I adore the Coconut Lime scent by Tree Hut. Put the two together and I am in heaven! I first discovered this scent when I purchasedTree Hut's Shea Sugar Body Scrub in Coconut Limehere on Amazon. I found the smell an irresistible summertime scent and was ecstatic when I learned they made it in a Shea Butter as well.Just as the scent of the Sugar Scrub lingered, so does the lotion. The lime is the dominant smell in this fragrance. Strong but not overpowering, this body butter rivals ones that sell for 3 times as much (and these come in a 3 pack!). Tree Huts Coconut Lime is summertime tropical fragrance your sure to fall in love with!",5
"Normally mascaras just go on but don't really give it a good pop, But this one makes my lashes noticeable and stand out  I really love what it does.",5
I use this on my hair after I wash it and it is great stuff. I also use it on my hair when I blow dry my hair and it cuts my blow drying time in half. It doesn't make my hair hard either. It's a light weight product.,5
"This is a good product for normal to dry skin, it offers excellent coverage with a glowing finish. This is why I wouldn't recommend it if your skin is very oily. It lasts all day if you set it with a powder. I use a mineral veil from the company of my choice to set the powder in my T-zone only. Remember that some setting powders might add more shine and glow so that will work against you if the glow isn't to your liking in the product itself. This is a great product for the cooler times of the year but summer probably will cause this sort of product to melt off your face or give you too much oily shine. The blendability is excellent in this product. I use an F80 flat top Kabuki brush from the big name company that starts with an &#34;S&#34; and ends with an &#34;a&#34; (Amazon prefers you don't post names of other companies in the review).All in all, this is a great product for the price and for being drugstore product. I would recommend it unless you have oily problem skin. It's a slight bit darker on the face than in the bottle. I use Creamy Natural C3, I'm a green eyed blond with cool undertones and it still came out too dark on me. That's not the fault of the seller or the company though, it's a matter of picking the right shade for oneself.",5
"I have short curly hair and most of the flat irons are for longer hair. I had been using flat irons and it made my hair break so I stopped using them. When I found this one I was doubtful that it would work... was I wrong. This flat iron is great. I can get close to the scalp and by being able to select the temperature easily I can avoid my hair breaking. I like the extra long cable and the swivel (no cord getting tangled) that comes with it. Also the flat iron heats very fast and it can go from 130F up to 450F degrees, which I converted from Celsius.I was able to style my hair quickly and it lasted through the day (most of the other irons that I have used did not deliver on styling).I highly recommend this product for anyone that uses a flat iron.",5
"Basically, this is a LONG, narrow ""scarf"" shaped microfiber towel that is used in the shower as a way to exfoliate the skin all over your body. I'm a distance swimmer who uses a ton of sunblock, so by the time I get out of the water, I'm really ready to SCRUB down my skin from head to toe and get all the chlorine and sunblock and salt and sand out of every pore of my skin. This Exfoliator definitely does the trick.The only thing to know about this is that it's NOT soft. This is pretty much the same texture as a brillo pad. It doesn't hurt your skin or anything, but it's not always a pleasant experience, especially if you have any sort of sensitive skin areas or sunburn.But if you want a deep down clean, including your back and other areas that are hard to really get at in order to really scrub down, this is the greatest product for the bath/shower. It's also excellent for traveling- it dries instantly and folds down into northing.",4
This is a really nice sunscreen for oily skin.. it is so smooth and not heavy and it gives a great look.. if you need you can put powder.. most cases powder is not needed.. Love it!!,5
"I understand this stuff is really with a mind to scarred and problem skin, it has heaps of Vitamin E which is good for helping scar tissue to heal. It smells so completely delicious it could fool you into tasting it! Excellent moisturisier and long lasting effects. Great as an aftersun!",5
"The product I received doesn't look exactly like the one here. The cream was a light green. I used it morning and night faithfully for nearly a month with no change. I gave it two stars instead of one because I have very sensitive skin and at least it didn't cause an allergic reaction or anything negative.I don't have significant wrinkles, but the area underneath my eyes is thinning out and so I need more of a firming cream to keep the skin from sagging. I had previously been using a collagen hand cream and a DMAE facial application and both of those work well, but they're not approved for the eye area, so I wanted something that wasn't going to damage by eyes. That's why I tried this product. I've since gone back to what worked for me even though they're not eye creams.",2
"I use a lot of body lotion, especially in the winter, so I'm always looking for a long-lasting, budget-friendly solution. This lotion is amazing! This goes on smoothly with no greasy after-feel, and a little bit goes a long way - something else my budget appreciates! The lotion lasted all day long, even through a rainstorm. My skin felt hydrated and happy all day long. I even like the scent - it's fresh, clean and not over-powering at all.This is a new beauty cabinet staple. And I love that I can save even more with Subscribe & Save!",5
"There is a really good variety of these.  I thought they were a little bigger when I bought them, but now after using them, I am happy they are smaller, they fit on the nail much better.  A lot of fun.  I use them for nails, but I can see how my daughter will probably use them for other craft things as well.",4
"i liked how this is a spray and is easy for applying and reapplying, unfortunately it leaves a oily shine. it doesn't feel oily but makes my arm shiny. u can definitely feel the sunblock, i hate the feeling of sunblock/sunscreen so i dont like this product. i prefer Bull Frog Mosquito Coast Sunblock SPF 30 spray more. obviously, after two application it feels worst. Yes, this protect with spf 70. I think the Helioplex formula is what makes it so shiny.",3
"This is the only detangler I will ever use the rest of my life unless it's no longer made.  It smells delicious, it is silky, and it doesn't have those chemicals or other ingredients (like mineral oil and dimethicone) that really aren't good for you.  It's nutritious, it works and it smells great - like mango or summer fruit.  I recommend it to everyone I know with curly, dry or biracial hair.  They love it too.",5
This is my daughter's favorite perfume that she wears daily.  Needless to say she goes through a lot of it!  This is the very best price I have found for such a large bottle.  I was pleased with the quick delivery as well.,5
"This stuff is pure, natural and completely gentle to any skin or skin problem. I use this on my skin if it is irritated from dermarolling or Retin A and needs a deep hydrating, soothing product. This stuff keeps skin ultra hydrated, plump and comfortable. It can be added to any moisturizer or skin care product to add additional hydrating benefits. A little goes a long way. I put a drop on my whole face and neck and then spray thoroughly with rosewaterHeritage Flower Water Rose 8 oz Liquidto hydrate the skin. Hyaluronic Acid attracts and holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water so it is very hydrating. It also needs water from the air or from something added to the skin surface or it will pull it out of your skin dehydrating it. It's like a liquid sponge so do keep it moist. But it does an amazing job to keep moisture where you want moisture to be, on your skin and in your cells.",5
Very high quality product. I am so happy that I went with this brand. The shea butter is smooth and free of any impurities. So far I have used some of it to make homemade chapstick. I plan to make some whipped body butter as well. This products is so easy to blend and use. I am very happy and will be ordering this shea butter again.,5
"My wife had great success withO'Keeffe's Healthy Feet Creme 3.2oz Jar, which made her want to try their hand cream as well. Once it was in the house, it was there for the trying.Me, I'm your typical guy who works in a factory, fixes stuff around the house, and plays piano on weekends. Every winter is the same story: I don't use hand cream, because it is too greasy and fey, and eventually, my hands dry out and start cracking, causing all kinds of interesting, and at times excruciating sensations in my hands. Then I would give in and start using whatever we had around the house, usually with mixed results. On a recent business trip to Mexico I came across an Italian made moisturizer that worked really great and helped my hands recover, but when that 1.15 ounce bottle ran out, it was back to my usual regimen of Vaseline, Neutrogena, and all your typical remedies, the ones that are so greasy and hard to absorb, you wonder if just dipping your hands in olive oil wouldn't be a better solution. My hands went back to being dry and cracked in a matter of days. Then I tried this product.I could tell right away it was not like anything I'd every used before. It is smooth going on, but not greasy at all after you've applied it and rubbed it in. It also doesn't have any noticeable odor. I did have a little burning at the start, but by the next morning, there were no noticeable ill effects. The dryness, cracking, redness, and itching that my usual regimen failed to address over the previous two weeks was completely healed in two days. Really, this stuff is nothing short of a miracle. What's better, because it doesn't leave your hands greasy, you can go back to your chores, or laundry, or dish washing, or piano playing, and again, your hands feel good, but there are no streaks and oily messes to deal with. You can even wash your hands a few times without taking all the beneficial coating away. Truly amazing.If you are like me and do not have much success with hand moisturizing products but are not ready to give up yet, I suggest you try O'Keeffe's. This stuff really is amazingly effective, and it will probably work for you where other products have not, just like it did for me.",5
The decoration wheel arrived just as described in the description and photo is an accurate depiction.  Nail glue easily keeps these attached to the nail and you will have to change your nail polish before you need to replace the slices!  The designs are great and offer an array of variety!,5
"Yeah it hurts, then you have a stuffy nose AND pain. Didn't do a thing for congestion. I threw it out after one use.",1
this is really good glitter it was a little bigger than what i wanted but it is still really nice. it was nicely packaged and it came faster than expected,5
"I first bought this eyeliner a few months ago when I couldn't find a pencil in the dark brown color I like. I found this eyeliner to be fantastic and recently ordered several more (love it so much, worried what I will do if I can't find it anymore!). Unlike a normal pencil, this eyeliner glides on (similar to liquid, but with the control of a pencil). Sometimes this liner does smudge if you don't use a little powder first, but over all I LOVE the consistency, the silky texture, and gorgeous color!",5
"Title says it all :) It's gentle, easily covers my roots, and gives my hair a luminous golden color with multi dimensional highlights. Will buy again!",5
"I'm not sure if this product actually grows hair because I haven't had it long enough to see results. What I can say about it is that it smells totally fine (contrary to some other reviews I've read). I'm caucasian so I don't think this product was meant for my texture of hair but I don't mind. It definitely makes your root greasy when it's on so I wouldn't go out or anything but for at-home-use, totally fine. I'm also a hairsylist and what I will say is that healthy hair starts from the inside but putting moisture and vitamins on your roots isn't a bad idea.  The concept makes sense.",4
A little goes along way. The product's bottle opening is about a the size of a nickle so I pour slowly. The aroma of this product to me is not appealing but fortunately the smell dissipates quickly. The product leaves a nice shine on the hair.Best usage for me on wet hair. On dry hair my hair started to curl up a little.Note: Review written after 3rd time of usage.Made in ???? - Country of Origin not mentioned on box or on bottle,4
"No lacquerista should be without this, makes cleanup so much easier and less likely to accidentally fall over (unlike the plastic cap to the polish remover bottle!)",5
"I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty.",5
"This is a fantastic, mild cleanser. It lasts for a long time because you only need to use a teeeeny bit. For years I bought it directly from my dermatologist's office and grossly overpaid until I found it here.",5
"need to get more, almost out. its a bit liquidy but it works out well. I need to start using it more.",4
"I have very dry, sensitive skin and living in Chicago, Land of Hard Water, doesn't help. Using natural, paraben-free products is important to me and over the past year or so since I first tried this lotion, it is the best natural lotion I have found for my skin. I apply it in the morning after showering and my skin stays hydrated and soft all day (even my elbows). It is more expensive than other lotions (especially grocery store stuff), but a little goes a long way and for my dry skin it's definitely worth the extra few bucks. The scent is floral and feminine, which I don't mind, but others may find it obnoxious or unwanted. I've smelled the regular Hemp scent in the store, though, and I did not care for it.",4
"I'm not sure what this is supposed to do? Bond the polish to your nail? The base coat itself bonded quite well with the polish, and then they decided to run off together without my nails in toe. I have perfect little nailshaped colored pieces now, so if I decide to craft in the future that could be helpful, I suppose....",1
it was just ok as in like any other salt scrum products as far as what it says it does firming and polishing even when i used exfoliating gloves  just drys your skin out either way with no change for the better,1
"I purchased this flat iron to replace the CHI that I had that broke after 3 years of use. As far as straightening goes, the HSI straightens as well as the CHI. The result is very silky, straight hair with no frizz whatsoever. With that being said, there are some flaws that I can't seem to overlook. One, the straightener does not get hot even at the hottest setting. I could overlook this since it seems to do the job somehow without getting too hot. My CHI got so hot that I couldn't even touch my hair a few seconds afterwards because it was so hot to the touch. That may be a downside to some people, but for me, that's the job of a flat iron. Two, the indicator light is virtually useless. It should turn from orange/red to green when the iron is at the desired heat setting, but it constantly switches from red to green for no apparent reason. Even if it is laying flat on a surface, it is constantly switching from red to green and I never know if the heat setting is right. This makes me think this is either a defect or that it doesn't maintain the heat setting. In addition, it takes forever for it to get hot and add that to the problem of not knowing if it's ""ready,"" and the whole process becomes annoying. What was the deal breaker for me is how this flat iron tugs at my hair. My head is still hurting from using it. If you can overlook these things, then maybe it's worth the purchase because it's so much cheaper than the CHI, but I use my iron everyday day, TWICE a day, so I want the product to be near perfect. My CHI was near perfect, until it broke on me of course.I honestly don't know how it got such high ratings because you really are paying for what you get. Yes, it does the job, but it sacrifices so many little things.",3
"I tried this after reading all the rave reviews.  I used it several times a day until I'd finished the jar (a couple of months).  Not only did it not strengthen or otherwise improve my nails, but it caused bumps in my nails as they grew out.  Not recommended.",2
"They work just perfectly with the conair compact styling setter, and it's much easier than the original clips that come with it. Worth it for sure.",5
I have been using it on my eyebrows and lashes for about a month and do see improvement. The hairs are thicker and darker and are not falling out as easily as they used to.  My lashes aren't really much longer and their numbers aren't increasing.  I had no allergic reaction. The one time it burned a little was when I was outside all day and my skin was dry. I do recommend trying it especially if you are scared of the prescription lash growing serum.,4
"Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base. I like it a lot!",4
I don't like the powder blushes which leave too much product and hard to blend. This is so easy to blend and looks so natural. Blending ability like no other.Well worth the money; wish they had it it the US - hard to find here.,5
"This is a nice product. The color was accurate. It covers well, is gentle on sensitive skin and goes on easily.",5
"I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Revlon is a good brand and I would buy this again,.",5
"I was hesitate to try this because Dove products are very cheap and basic but it was such a good deal, I bought it thinking I would use it for emergencies if I ran out of my better brands.  When I opened and smelled it, I knew I had to try it.  It smells heavenly.  I have used it several times and I can say this is as good or better than $10 - $20 body washes.  It smells great, lathers up well, don't need to use a lot, moisturizes skin, everything a body wash should do.  I will continue to buy this and save a lot of money while getting the same benefits of higher priced brands.",5
"I was sent some Advanced Anti Cellulite Treatment & Body Firming Cream to try out for myself and I honestly have to say I was rather skeptical.  I've been using the product for about a week now and much to my surprise I've seen some slight improvement already. Because of where my &#34;lovely&#34; marks are I didn't take before and after photos, but I have noticed a small change. My stretch marks are still there and the cellulite is still there. The improvement comes in the fact that they have all lightened up a bit since using the cream. Remember, it's only been about a week since I've used the cream. I use it after my evening showers before bed. I apply the cream and rub it in like any other lotion. It does have a slight smell - not stinky,but nothing you'd want to wear as a perfume scent either. Also, you will feel a bit &#34;greasy&#34; feeling after applying the lotion and generally I wash my hands after to get it off. After a few minutes though I don't feel that way once the lotion has dried up. I don't feel any pain, burning, stinging or tingling. It's just like adding a lotion. After about a week is when I started seeing the improvement. While I don't know what the final results or how long it'll take to get there yet, I'm feeling confident since seeing some improvement after just a week. I'm impressed and can't wait to further the results! If only there was a way to speed it up even faster!",5
i bought the orange concealer for  dark circles under my eyes... didn't like the consistency kinda cakey and didn't give much coverage..... thought it a waste of money,2
"I have one daughter that has course, dry, frizzy hair, so I try just about everything I can get my hands on that claims to work, well. I have purchase a couple of other TRESEMME products, and found they lived up to their claim, so I hoped TRESEMME 7 DAY KERATIN SMOOTH CONDITIONER; 9 OUNCE would do the same.After only one use, I noticed a considerable difference in my daughter&#8217;s hair. Wow! Soft, and silky, and the frizz was definitely reduced. I wouldn&#8217;t say it lasted seven days, but perhaps over time that might hold true.My only regret, I didn&#8217;t purchase the shampoo as well.Product Information:&#8226;Gorgeous, salon-smooth hair for up to 1 week&#8226;Easily create your style with less frizz and more manageability&#8226;Use with 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and Heat Activated Treatment&#8226;Gentle enough for everyday use and on color treated hair&#8226;ThermaFlex Technology helps hair resist humidity&#8226;Infused with Keratin for smoothnessProduct DescriptionWith its moisture-enhanced formula, TRESemm&eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner gently conditions women's hair to help create smooth, frizz-resistant styles that last for up to 7 days* when used with TRESemm&eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and TRESemm&eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.

"This is a nice little kit to get you started. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. I actually think their ""rinse with baking soda in water"" is a mess. Instead I purchased a product: pH neutralizer from Cellbone that's also available here on Amazon. As far as the brush separating, that's really not a big deal for me as it seems many do.  They really should include a neutralizer.",4
"I can't explain how wonderful this product.  Your face looks so smooth and nice.  Covers so well & evenly.  Your skin feels good, does not clog pores like liquid makeup can.  I just LOVE this mineral face makeup, I won't use any other brand of mineral makeup.  Fantastic that brush is connected to makeup container.  You don't have to carry separately, perfect if you want to carry in purse and freshen up when out and about or at work.  Must have for me.",5
"I don't use shampoo often, just twice a week, and this one works well enough to get the hair products and hairspray out of my hair, it has a pleasant smell, and the bottle size is huge.",3
"In winter, my hands often crack and bleed. I need a moisturizer that works very well, and doesn't come off easily. When this lotion arrived, I was thrilled - it has a luscious scent, the same as all the other Suave Moroccan Infusion products. I globbed a bit on my hands, and liked how they felt when the lotion soaked in.It didn't last. As soon as I washed my hands, they felt as rough as sandpaper.  I quickly went back to my heavy-duty lotion, which is boring and unscented, but keeps my hands baby-soft. I decided to use the Suave Professionals Body Lotion on my legs, so I'd get the benefit of the lovely scent on a part of me that doesn't get so much abuse.The lotion works beautifully on my legs. I'm very happy when I use it there, while using a much stronger lotion on my hands.",4
"I like the smallest size for eye brushes.  (I did a complete review if you look under brush guard shaddow/ liner package)  For all remaining brushes I found these to be too stiff.  I like a more flexible guard to assist with tapering the brushes. The generic purple ones are my favorite, and cheaper.B00BSPVDE8",3
"Removes my stubborn waterproof mascara and bulletproof under eye concealer like a charm. Best remover I've ever tried, hands down. I think I'm on my sixth bottle, maybe seventh (lost count). Doesn't bother my contacts, doesn't have a weird greasy consistency AT ALL, leaves no residue, does the job. Perfect. If I'm being nit-picky, the packaging isn't stellar, but the product is so good that I honestly couldn't care less. Love it and will continue to repurchase.",5
I love this perfect bright yet deep red nail gel polish. it is just a hot classic color to have on hand.,5
"I have owned this Hot Air Brush for a year and a half and I cannot say enough good things about this product.  My naturally curly straightens out beautifully using this Hot Air Brush.  I don't need my hair pin straight so I don't use a flat iron.  I like some body to my hair and this brush does just that.  It takes the curl out of my hair but it leaves my hair full of body and without flyaways.  It comes with 3 attachments: a blow dryer attachment and 2 brushes.  The larger brush has a line of bristles and then a line of plastic pins sticking out and then another line of bristles etc. I have to be careful using the large brush because if I move to quickly to brush my hair the plastic pins poke me in the head. lol  Just something to keep in mind when using the large brush.  The small brush does not contain any plastic pins, only bristles.  I am guessing the plastic pins in the large brush help move the brush through the hair so it doesn't get tangled around the bigger brush and so the hair is separated in order to properly dry the hair throughout.  I really think you will like this Hot Air Brush as much as I do.  I have not had any problems or issues with this brush and I have had it for almost 2 years.  : )",5
"My son has eczema on his hands which causes dry, cracked bleeding little fingers. Our dermatologist said it's the toughest area to control. He was right. I've tried prescription creams, lotions, more creams, oils and essential oils (lavender oil is supposed to be amazing for healing dry skin). Nothing helped. On a whim I grabbed this at CVS ($7 for just one tube) and every day you can tell the skin was healing. 4 days later his little fingers are getting soft again. Amazing stuff. For my child I can't be without this.",5
"I like this product a lot. I have purchased at least 5 of these this year, so I can safely say that I love the results. I do not use it every day, it depends on my activity. I do use it every other night on clean toned skin before applying a nigh time moisturizer. When I do wear it in the day time it is under my daily sunscreen of foundation. The product does work. I can say with honesty that my skin looks more plumped out with the use of this product. I also do my best to take care of the inside too. Juicing, clean lifestyle and plenty of water. I really consider this product a must have for the promotion of healthy looking skin!",5
"The consistency of the Pure & Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is a bit different from the one I'm currently using and the ones I've tried before. It's a bit pasty and has this eucalyptus/menthol scent. When using it, I suggest not putting the mask near the eye area because of the eucalyptus/menthol scent. It did sting my eye a bit at first (I'm not sure how to explain it but the scent itself stung my eye) but got better after about a minute. Actually, when I sat down and waited for the mask to dry up, the eucalyptus/menthol scent became soothing and relaxing. :) After the Pure & Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask dried up, I rinsed it off my face. I was glad that it rinsed off easily. I was very satisfied with the results. My skin looked brighter, my pores looked smaller and the 2 big acne on my chin looked less inflamed and smaller. I like that my skin looked rejuvenated and better.",5
"I thought that I would get a few pearls, but they were full with pearls and all sorts of colors with it.",5
"This is not an impressive product after several uses. I had expected something by now but the results are mediocre at best. I've had mixed results with the products from Motions at Home, some doing a great job and some not, and this one did not.",2
"This is great for My mineral foundation.  It goes on smooth and does not glob all the makeup in one spot, spreads evenly.  I love that it has a large base and often stand it up on the counter.",5
"I started using this post shave gel a few weeks ago and I've been really pleased with the results. The gel feels amazing on my face and I've been pleased with the results. This post shave gel will be a part of my shaving routine for years to come.The gel's cooling effect is great, but it's not the only positive aspect of this product. It's easy to apply and it doesn't take forever to wash off. I've stopped using gels in the past and I've stopped using them because of how long it takes to get off.This Axe Face Hydrator is worth a try. I bet you'll be pleased with the results as I was.",5
"It isn't as thick and moisturizing as using olive oil or coconut oil (I'm an avid &#34;OCM-er&#34; aka the Oil Cleansing Method). But its kind of nice still, lighter, and still moisturizing. It smells nice too, but that tells me there is probably added fragrance which I am not a fan of, but all well. I'll take it to use at my cabin. Probably won't re-purchase though, stick to my coconut oil with tea tree oil and lavender.",4
"They took a while to arrive, but I think that's a given that they're coming from so far away.  What a fantastic purchase. I bought these and the other set that's listed on the page.  Beautiful, functional and heavy.  Not cheap plastic parts, but heavy metals and glass gems.  What a beautiful surprising purchase.  Will definitely buy from these guys again!",5
"Let me preface that I am white as a wall and have tried- L'oreal, St. Tropez, Nivea, Neutrogena, Jergens, Fake Bake, Moroccan Mineral Tan, Sun Labs, Body Drench, Banana Boat, Glow Fusion, Sally Hansen, Mystic Tan- and others. Living in California I like looking tan and I've been doing self tanning for over a decade now. THIS self tanning foam gives you a really good, natural-looking tan for less than $12 including shipping.I'm raving about that amazing, brown-toned color similar to (and possibly even better than) FakeBake at HALF the price. Another plus, is I like the smell better. I use the 'Dark' tone instead of medium. I do this because I want to get a deep tone and not have to apply more than one or two times to get the desired hue. It's so great- no orange! Be sure to exfoliate like a madman before applying this. I also use a self-tanner mitt. St. Moriz makes one they sell here on amazon, otherwise you can buy the St. Tropez one. Stock up on this product ladies! My first shipment did take about 5 weeks to arrive so keep in mind it can take time because this is shipping from the UK. My next order I put in more than one so I don't run out :)",5
"While the marketers definitely knew how to target their audience (the packaging is cute and appealing), it would have been nice if Cover Girl had spent some more time making sure their mascara lived up to its hype.This mascara adds volume, but not necessarily extra length.  One bonus is the ""super-volumizing brush"" which definitely has a lot to do with the added volume.  However, Cover Girl needs to work on their ""buildable fiber-stretch formula"" - while they do make your lashes look dense they don't make them look longer.",3
The green is perfect for redness. My only complaint is that I ordered in April 2014 its now May 2014 and the green is all gone and I don't even use it everyday. But it definitely does the job of concealing and erasing redness.,4
"I don't really wear eyeshadow, but I use it on my clients and it works wonders! Before I apply the ELF eyeshadow, i put this on and the eyeshadow sticks to it amazingly! definitely worth it.",5
I was so disapointed when i opened my package! All of the balls were mixed. Nota pone color os completely on its own. Better packaging needed.,1
"This mascara was recommended to me by makeup artist Carmindy. I will never ever go back to regular ones that make me look like a panda even after eye makeup remover. This is so clean and easy. I have brown eyes and light skin, I just gave a try to dark blue and it looks better/softer/lighter than black. Love it!",5
"I have to use conditioner, as I can't get a comb through my wet hair without it.  This conditioner does an excellent job of detangling.  However, it's supposed to be part of a volumizing system (with the shampoo of the same name), and I see no volume in my fine, straight hair after using it.  It has a very faint &#34;soapy&#34; scent that dissipates quickly, but I prefer a stronger scent. If you dislike scented hair products and don't actually want to increase the volume of your hair, it might be a fine product for you",3
My hair is light ash blonde & this color is perfect. I still can't believe it's discontinued. I used this for years & I have never been so satisfied with a brow pencil as I am with this. I wish I could find one that would be as good as this one.,5
"The product does appear to work as they claim and its working pretty good.  I use it 3 times every day, not always the same times though cause I get busy so I do whenever I have free time. I really like it and would recommend to others!",5
"I've been tempted to try one of these serums for some time now.  So I did!  I started using this vitamin C serum 3 days ago and while I know that is not long enough to see effects, I did want to share my experience.First, the product arrived in a lovely package and glass bottle.  It smells slightly citrus and has a bit of a cloudy appearance.  I applied the serum as noted, after I've washed my face.  I find that I have to use a little more than a pea-sized amount of liquid as I have a larger face.  It has a cooling sensation when applied and a pleasant smell.  So far, so good.  I've had no adverse effects whatsoever.  I do have occasional acne and had acne when I started using this product.  I'm not sure if the serum has dried out these blemishes, but they have disappeared in the last 3 days.  I do suffer with cystic acne and I was sure that I was going to have a monster.  NOPE!  It's gone!So, like I said; so far so good.  I'll report back with my effects after my 30 days!",5
I bought this to go with the Real Techniques brushes as Sarah uses this brand of contouring in her videos. I am Caucasian with olive skin (I also spray tan a few times a months) and I got the &#34;medium&#34; and it works perfectly.,5
"This is a nicely presented set of straighteners, Ergonomically friendly buttons, and easy to use out of the box.The packaging boasts ""Compare to CHI a $130 value""They may be good ""salon heat"" capable, but CHI they are not.For anyone on a budget however they are great.Heat is the key (as with any straighteners) and 430F is not shabby, even if it takes a while to get to maximum heat.The iron surface looks good, only time will tell on it's longevity, and damage later on (that's why I held back a star).The old maxim stands true, if you want $200 results you won't get it for under $50 (current Amazon special price as of 5/27/09).What you will get is certainly your money's worth. Nice product 4 stars.",4
This mascara is not all that great its just okay. It didnt do anything great for my lashes I have used better.It does clump a little and it does not separate your lashes all that well either. I have to use one of those eyelash combs.Good thing I got it on sale.,2
Talk about PALE PINK.. if your wanting that shade this one is perfect. and its MATE so its not shiny. very pale but I wanted that effect. Really liked it alot and it shipped fast.,5
The dotting feature is nice but don't expect the brush to be the thick one like salons have. The bristles are thin and flimsy and work poorly to take any polish off for clean edges,2
"I've used a good amount of peels in my day and I have to say this is one of the most clean and effective peels I've used for an intermediate peel.The peel itself is Level 2 of its grading scale and it is definitely a lot stronger than Level 1  but I would definitely suggest Level 2 for the graduated user (and for the unfeeling beasts) especially if you can take a bit of pain for a stronger response.Suggestions:- ALWAYS test a small patch first before doing the entire face. You want to make sure to test how it will react with your skintype.- Start Soft and work your way up. Start at 1-2 minutes on the skin depending on your pain threshold and work yourself up to 5 minutes TOPS.- DO NOT get in eyes, mouth, ear, nose. If you get it in those ears, You're going to have a BAD TIME.- Flush with water at the end and PAT your face with a clean towel. Do not Rub or Pick at your skin since it is sensitive.- You can layer the peel if you are comfortable with the peel for more effectiveness! I personally do heavier peel and then within the 2 minute mark do another lighter layer.- Qtip for problem spots, Cotton pads for all over the face.Pros:+ StrongIt is good in the sense that it provides great exfoliation without it burning your face+ BRILLIANT applicator/PackagingOther peels I've used had just a bottle with an open touch making it incredibly cumbersome to apply but the squeezer makes it very easy!+Color and ViscosityIt is clear and the texture/viscosity makes it both easy and very comforting to apply onto the skin. Others are either too liquid or viscous to apply well.+ Fresh scentAlmost comes off as eucalyptus. The scent is clean and has a very leafy and fresh smell that is head-and-shoulders above any peels I've used thus far. This is already grounds for going with this (peel users will know what I'm all about).+ Quantity/SizeThis will last you a good amount. I used this profusely (even too much at times) and it still surprised how far this can go. It says 10-15 peels but this lasted me 15-20 with medium usage. Excellent.Cons:- Almost TOO effectiveYou'll start 'frosting' hard and peeling because of how well it works. The best way to combat this is to ensure buying the correct face lotion/moisturizer. I'd check out Cetaphil Noncomodegenic Moisturizer with 30 SPF.- Pricey but worth itThis one is definitely a little pricier than the other peels but not by much. This isn't really a con since I consider this worth every penny. Others may have differing results and so the price point may not be the best.This is probably one of the best peels I've ever used and I would highly recommend a slightly seasoned user to check it out. I suggest this peel to others and have received nothing bout great comments. Just get ready for a little pain for beauty.5/5 STRONG purchase.&#34;Peel away your problems.&#34; :)",5
"Have had this for a while, works great and even after a year I have not had to change the bulbs. Great price and fast shipping!",5
"BE CAREFUL!I was lucky to have the baking soda water ready. Within a mine my skin started to melt and bubble. It was scary and awful . DO NOT USE THIS! I was lucky to have everything ready. I do not think this should be sold to the public ike this. I did not know enough about it, and my research was not vast enough. I should have known much more. It was terrible and the stress reaction I had because of this had me sick for days. It was very scary and left my skin blistered and awful. It has since healed, but was not worth it. This is something that could damage your face badly! Please leave this to professionals. DO not try this at home. This percent is WAY TOO STRONG too. Scary that this can be purchased online. It says superficial peel, not so much! I don't think people really understand how dangerous this is.",1
"I am relaying a review on this product from my wife, who likes this hair straightener.Pros:Gets really hot, really fast - so it's good for thick hairDoesn't pull your hair like some irons doDoes a very nice job, equal to the job her CHI does, but at a fraction of the cost.Cons:Design flaw has you holding the iron in such a way that you can turn it off inadvertantly right in the middle of using it.  To combat this, hold down the - (minus) button and it will lock in the temperature so you don't turn it down or off.She recommends this hair straightener.",4
"Fresh Awake is another great product in the Dove Men + Care line. It is a body and face wash that has a pleasant, mild pine scent. The wash is a pale yellow color with small red crystals embedded in it. The yellow soap is thick and smooth, and the red crystals give an abrasive cleansing action. The abrasive quality is minimal compared to other washes I have used that feel like sandpaper. The thickness of the body and face wash lets you use a small amount to clean large areas of the body. What I like best about the wash is that it does not leave a residue on the skin after using it in the shower. It can be rinsed off cleanly without the feeling of having a dry coating of soap on your skin when you get dressed. It does leave a faint pine fragrance on the body after use, a good feature.",5
"I am very surprised the complaints of clumping in the other reviews.  My teenage daughter purchased this mascara and we both think it is excellent.  The wand is what makes the application so smooth.  My favorite mascara of all time is Lancome Definicils, but I think I am changing to this one!  As far as removing the mascara, try Lancome Bifacil eye makeup remover - it takes off everything.",5
"Love this product, it leaves my hair so smooth and silky ! The smell is incredible, it smells all day long. I can't get enough!!! I wish it was a little cheaper but it's worth the price.",5
"I do find the Gelish top & bottom coats to be the best I've tried and I've tried Red Carpet, OPI & Sensationail.",5
"After using several Olay products, I find that they work better than brands costing much more. I am a religious evening face washer and apply this product every evening. I notice that my skin is smooth and clear in the morning. I especially like the fragrance free. I am never going to stop the progression of my age. I just want to look as good as I can every day. This Olay product line works for me.",4
Nice jumbo eyeliner. It is really pink so if like the color wear it or if a little bright then just put a little eye shadow over it to tone it down. Great item I love these jumbo eyeliners. Thank you seller,4
Great kit for nail heads that love nail design! Perfect for someone like me who is starting out with dotting design! I enjoy it and the tools are cute!,5
"I used this product so many times on clients. The best tester is on myself because I have weird skin. It works great on all skin colors and even African American skin.Pros: It covers well and its thin based without losing coverageIts in a Palette :)The color range is perfect even for correcting.Cons: It can get greasy at times. I have really oily skin and this can be a nightmare for that. However, add translucent powder and you will be fine.",5
"My hair is curly and this product makes my hair look great.  With just a small amount applied to towel-dried hair, my hair looks shiny but not greasy and it is helpful against the humidity as well.  Additionally, the product does not smell bad.",5
"I too was skeptical of its effectiveness, but the problem was not using it regularly. After 2-3 weeks of using it daily then twice daily, my fine lines are fading!",5
"I absolutely love this oil.  When am at work at least one person compliments me for this perfume.  They usually say ""pachouli""  and the conversation continues.  They go on to say how they were as hippies, etc.  This was my first time ever using pachouli and I have gotten more compliment than when I used expensive perfumes.I will be ordering a second bottle in the near future.",5
"I was looking to buy a waver/crimper for sometime. Decided to just order this one from amazon since I only had to pay $3.99 for overnight shipping with amazon prime and it also had good reviews. It definately does the job, but I highly suggest have some gel or mousse dried in your hair first to help hold the crimper and to get it to crimp faster. It takes about 2 mins per bunch of hair to get a good crimp/wave and I have medium to fine hair. I do put it on the highest temp, which I know isn't good but I use heat protection spray. I am happy with product.",4
"This is an understated, no-frills creme finish that is quite glossy (no need for top coat) and the colour is a classy neutral that is definitely suitable for work. Because taupe colours are so vague, the easiest way for me to describe it is in hexadecimal: #594741. In other words, it's about 60% brown, 35% grey, and 5% slightest hint of rose. I consider it a warmer and lighter shade than You Don't Know Jacques from what I've seen, and while YDKJ looks great, this suits my skin tone better.The polish was kind of sheer at first coat, but two coats is fine. It's also very longlasting, being OPI brand and all (can easily go for a week without chipping).",5
"Five stars isn't enough stars to express how wonderful this product is!!!!,,,, this really sets ur makeup all day! One day I had on my make up for the 8 hours at work n then went to exercise I. The afternoon,,,even though I sweat it was still there!! I keep one in my amazon cart because I will never do without this ever again",5
"I read all of the customer reviews before I bought this, and they all conflicted, but I still wanted to give it a try. After I placed the order, I asked the manager at the tanning salon what she knew about the brand, and she told me to never buy tanning lotion off the Internet, that it could be anything in that bottle. Maybe that was just her wanting me to buy from the salon- when I showed it to her, she did have to eat her words...she admitted it was authentic, but couldn't place the smell. One review said this smells like warm vanilla sugar- my bottle does not. Another said it had a subtle fresh scent, and afterwards, didnt experience that ""after-tan smell"". That was confirmed...I stopped at a gas station right after tanning, and the guy working asked what perfume I was wearing! I already had a good base tan, but had reached a plateau and wasn't getting any darker, that's what made me want to buy this, some reviews said it's just wonderful, and they are so much more tan, etc. It does have good moisturizer. I've left my Mom and BFF both use it and they like it. And the smell? I have Shout gel stain remover...that's the closest I can think of to describing the smell..but thats not a bad smell...",4
"after reading rave reviews, I was not that impressed. this felt like heavy makeup being applied to my legs not good for my use",2
"The brushes are great, I am so happy that I ordered them and any one that buys them will too",5
"Let me first say that Pura D'or is the BEST! Their products as well as their customer service are outstanding.I've been using Pura D'or products for a while now and decided to give their Pure Organic Argan Oil a try. I've been using it on my skin and hair for about 2 months now, and it really is incredible. I'll be 52 in a couple months, and have slight sun damage on my face (darker spots), fine wrinkles, and rosacea and am beyond pleased with this product.For face: After I wash my face, while the skin is still damp, I rub on a few drops of oil and let it sink in. It really is miraculous. Dark spots on my forehead and cheeks from sun damage are fading, as are the dark circles under my eyes. Fine lines are diminishing as well. My skin glows in a beautifully healthy way, and I've received quite a few compliments in the past few days about how great I look. I do love what this does! I've found it works best on damp skin--it not only locks moisture in, it also makes the oil easier to use. I don't need to use as much, it spreads more easily, and sinks in better. Oh yes! I had a small pimple outbreak on my chin, and this stuff cleared it up in a day. There must be some kind of antiseptic quality similar to Walnut oil that helps heal outbreaks, rashes and cuts. This makes my skin velvety soft, much softer than when I use moisturizer by itself. When I first started using it, my skin drank it up like no one's business. I don't need to use as much anymore.Body: the red spots on my arms are gone. The skin is soft and smooth. The texture on my neck and chest looks much better, too. I use this after shaving my legs, and alligator skin doesn't happen anymore! Again, just a couple drops on damp skin works. Don't need a lot! The condition of my nails has also improved--after I use it on my face or body, I always rub the excess into my nails and cuticles. My cuticles are also healthier - easier to push back and no hang nails.Hair: I have high lighted hair and the ends can become very dry. I rub a couple drops in the palm of my hands and then apply it to the ends. After that, I cimb my hands through my hair but avoid the scalp because I need lift and I tend to have oily scalp yet dry ends. I have heard that it is great if you have dandruff or dry scalp though. It really helps cut down on fly-aways, without adding any weight.All in all, it's big YES for my skin. I forgot to mention, I have sensitive skin and it reacts to most products, i.e., rash and pimples. I have had none of that with Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil.People Have commented on the smell-I think it smells good. It definitely doesn't smell sweet or perfumey-and it shouldn't! It's 100% Argan Oil and that's it. In other words, it doesn't smell like synthetic cosmetic products do. It smells a little like sesame oil and I don't even smell it unless I put my nose to the bottle. I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though. It doesn't just sit on the surface-it penetrates deeply and nourishes skin, hair, and nails.This has become as essential as toothpaste and lipstick for me!It really does help, not just the look, but the overall health of my skin and nails. Highly recommend Pura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil!",5
"I am white with problematic thick, curly, coarse hair.  Brushing my hair during or after my shower is normally a nightmare, but not with this brush.  It feels like it's not even doing anything it's so painless, but after I was done, the tangles were gone.  HIGHLY recommended if you, like me, dread the after-shower brushing.",5
These cute brushes are just that. They are so cute that if you're a girl into pink you will love them because of the color. They are decent material and work well with makeup. They are a good deal for the count and for the materials. My daughter likes them simply cause they are pink...,4
"This is such a wonderful sunscreen.  High SPF, yet totally non-irritating.  Although label states ""pediatric"", this formula is excellent for adults who need a gentle, non-irritating sunscreen.",5
"I received a wonderful Dead Sea Facial Mask from Adovia. I loved this mask! My mother and I used it as soon as I received it. We left it on for the recommended 20 mins and when we removed it our skin was so soft! There was not redness or burning after removing the mask which I have experienced with other masks.This mask is recommended to help with acne, eczema, blackheads and psoriasis. For only $30 it is a steal on amazon! All you have to do is apply a light layer to your freshly washed skin and let it dry for 20 mins then wash it off with warm water. I love this mask and would recommend it to anyone!",5
"I keep WANTING to love PTR products, but always find something cheaper or organic that's better. I have extremely dry skin, and this lotion felt very moisturizing to the touch, but seemed to need quite a bit of time to soak in, making makeup application difficult. Best use as a night cream.",3
"I received a small sample of this from my dermatoligist, and I used it for 3 days with my clarsonic brush on my forehead and it got rid of the bumps on my forhead.  I think this is and amazing product.  I will continue to purchase!",5
I use this more on my feet than my face or body it really helps with the dryness that I have on the bottom of my feet.  It leaves my feet really soft through out the day which I like.,3
"it works really well.  and we also love  the pot.  it's unique, so we  can find it easily among our stuff.  this is  our  lip treatment of choice.  if you  travel with it  tho, protect it.  the pot can  crack.  not  a big  deal,, we  are using one now  that we were rough with on  our last trip.  it's still fine.",5
"I have tried several other products from Adovia, including this one and have had a pretty good experience with them all. This gel goes on easily and feels cool going on, but I didn't like that after applying the product around my eyes, there was a bit of a burning feeling. However, the burning sensation only lasted maybe 30 seconds or so. My only other issue was that it didn't absorb as fast as other products I have used in the past, but it's not bad. I have really dark, purple under eye circles and having pale white skin doesn't help either. I didn't see much a huge difference in reducing the appearance of my dark circles but it did help.. And, to give this product credit, again the my dark circles are bad, so when I say that this helped, I'll take it! And, it really helped with the puffiness and it did seem to leave the eye area feeling more moisturized. I have noticed the fine lines around the eye area are becoming less noticeable and I think that is because they're more hydrated. But, overall I liked it. I would definitely recommend this product if you're looking for an extra boost of moisture for around your eyes and to help and reduce the appearance of dark circles.Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.",4
"The product smells great, the pump action works smoothly, and it's nice to have a non-toxic formula. The moisturizing action is as promised, and it's nice to have a product that doesn't include unnecessary dyes.",5
"I discovered that the 3rd , 4th, and 5th ingredients was actually alcohol.... And since my hair is curly , it is dry already , so I don't want any extra chemicals that will dry out my hair.... it will probably work for straight hair",3
i wanted to buy this macadamia shampoo and rinse down at our local kaneohe oahu winward mall trade secret salons...but they sold out of the sets and only had 1 economy size of the shampoo but no conditioner...so i had to order it here at amazon..first of i want to say my deepest thank you to deal seekers who sells the shampoo and Omni solutions who i got the mac nut oil rinse out conditioner from them ...there delivery is fast and sooner than the described time...all packed well...excellent customer services too!! i love both the shampoo & conditioner rinse which both made my hair soft and manageable...the leave in i got from trade secret 12oz bottle..love it but i wouldnt use this leave in as a daily useage its too heavy creamy i rather use the leave in on colder winter months...but the shampoo and conditioner kept my hair soft and healthy kept my color in without stripping the color!! i definitley would repurchase!! thank you deal seekers and Omni solutions!!!!! THUMBS UP!!!,5
"Not for curly hair, regardless of your hair cuticle texture.  I have very fine, thin hair that just happens to spiral curl, and thought that perhaps since my hair is not coarse I could still make this item work for me.  It really doesn't.  If I were to flat iron or blow dry my hair, I suppose I could have more luck with it, but I shy away from such heat intensive curly hair abuse and definitely won't sacrifice the healthy of my hair just to try to better accommodate a hair accessory.So, if you have straight hair: kudos to you, this item should work well for you, and is well constructed to last and give you a quality result (tried it on a gal pal with straight hair after my abysmal failure to launch this look on myself).If you like to convert your curls to straight and then do an updo/bun style, try it out, but I have no results to report to you.If you're like me, a curly girl who won't go straight, then save the $$ and just buy the super long Conair bobby pins (not those old fashioned straight roller pins that we grew up calling bobby pins...they're not the same thing) as 2 or 3 of those criss-crossed in my hair worked exponentially better at holding my bun in place than this did.",2
It is not greasy and provides some moisture to you skin while allowing some protection from the sun. It does seem to melt away with sweat so if you sweat you can be sure to lose your protection. Even on my arms it did not seem to stay.I wanted to like this since it is not greasy I thought it would be good for summer with the matte finish and light weight protection but it just doesn't last.It is also very liquid and not creamy as most hand creams and body creams.,2
"Sometimes it feels like I've tried every single natural skincare product out there (Mychelle, Origins, Dermae, Eminence, etc.) but nothing ever seems to be quite right for my face.I was buying a few random items in Walgreens one day and stumbled across the Eclos skincare line.  I figured, why not?  My current cleanser was failing miserably.  I bought the starter kit and fell in love with this face wash (the other products I was not impressed with, though the moisturizer worked fairly well).This face was is perfect because it deep cleans but doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped away or dried out.  It is gentle enough to remove eye makeup as well.  I use it with the Clarisonic Mia and have seen fantastic results in my skin.  It helps fade discoloration, even out skin tone, and prevents blemishes.  I use it two times a day and never feel like my skin is agitated.Considering that it is far more affordable than most other natural brands and works just as if not better than- I would recommend it.  The bottle also lasts quite a while.  I would suggest leaving it out of the shower, somewhere dry and away from water since water easily gets into the bottle and makes the product watery and bad.",5
I have been looking at these for a while now and they look beautiful. I have not purchased these but have keap coming back to look at the designs and have been thinking of purchasing these. currently I own another brands image plates and I've been looking for some more and these just seem perfect. You get 25 image plates for a really good price and I think thats what keeps me coming back to this and thinking about purchasing.,4
"When I was asked if I'd like to try Perfective Ceuticals products containing Growth Factor, I was skeptical. I am a 'Doubting Thomas'.  You know 'seeing is believing'. I decided I didn't have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.My first thought: 'If this product line works, how will I prove it?'...you know 'seeing is believing'. So I got out my point and shoot camera & took some before pictures. Oh, my gosh, the pictures I took wouldn't prove anything. Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot. So, I am sorry, but I will not be able to provide evidence for you to see.I'm in my mid 60's, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled  with light colored freckles.  As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily. I've never been a sun worshiper so I don't have many deep wrinkles, just  normal aging wrinkles. In my 50's, my eyelids started getting what I call  'creepy, wrinkly' looking (just looked it up & the term is crepey).  The  wrinkles looked even worse if I wore frosted eye shadow. I eventually stopped wearing most eye shadows & opted instead for a natural, matte color.I've been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly. The skin around my eyes looks younger, the crepey eye lids have improved enough that frosted eye shadow doesn't look all that bad on me now, but I'm not planning on going back to it. My crow's feet are less defined. They're still there - they haven't disappeared - yet they're not as noticeable. I  have small bags under my eyes  which have improved.  Although some days, they're back..so I'm not sure what's going on.  I never had dark circles under my eyes, so I can't comment on that claim.I began as instructed, by applying a pea-sized amount of lotion to my eye area twice a day. That amount ended up being more than enough for two eyes.  So I'm using less now. Being a thrifty person, I also experimented by using this product once a day. It didn't take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  Perfective Ceutical Eye Cream twice a day.  So twice a day it is.  This eye cream isn't heavy  & is absorbed quickly.  It doesn't have any fragrance. Although I don't have sensitive skin, I experienced irritated, watery eyes when I first began using it. After emailing customer service for suggestions, I figured out that I was too careless when I applied the lotion. I was getting it into the corners of my eyes. As soon as I started applying the cream more carefully & avoiding all eye contact, the irritation stopped.Summing up, my crow's feet are less defined, my crepey eye lids have improved a lot, & on most days, my under-eye bags  aren't as puffy. The skin around my eyes definitely looks younger now.  And actually, when I use this eye cream along withAnti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor&Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factortwice a day, I've been told that I look 10 years younger.  My wrinkles haven't disappeared, but are less noticeable. My skin is more  youthful looking.  Just remember that my skin isn't sun damaged and most of my wrinkles aren't deep.Do not store this product in extreme heat or cold.Product guarantee copied from Perfective Ceutical's website:""Perfective Ceuticals' products are designed to be sold exclusively by dermatologists and dermatology professionals.

I began having problems with breakouts as I entered my 40s and was incredibly frustrated. I began using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night for minor wrinkles and within a few weeks my skin problems quickly faded. It does really help with minor wrinkles and some lines that we starting before I began using this product are all but gone. I highly recommend the product not just because it really does what it says but also because it cleared up my skin (the best bonus they I would never have expected!).,5
Works perfect for my gelish nails I do at home! It was cheap but works wonderfully I am very impressed!,5
"I really have not use this yet, but I know it is going to be the best thing I have had for my nail, I love to make my nail look good, and this will do it.",5
"I got my jar at a local Dollar tree (for a dollar), and I'm going back later today to get the other 4 jars they had in stock. This smells kind of like hotel products, but it's pretty good. I am Caucasian with somewhat curly to curly hair, and it helped keep it moisturized when drying after my shower (my hair dries  into a big puff of frizz that actually seems to repel hair. Ugh).I have yet to see how well it works after a week or so, but this stuff is really good for just not drying so badly that I'm getting more.*Edit*I don't have to scrunch my hair so much to get it uniformly curly now, which is nice. I've been using it for about a week and so far, it's great.I got the remaining 4 jars of it, I love it so much. It works well, a lot less frizz than I used to have.I got the curl reviving spray and the feather whipped curl creme at a different Dollar Tree (again, 1 dollar each). I haven't used them yet, but if you live near a Dollar Tree and might purchase any of these products, look there first!",5
"This was a superb eyeliner. Goes on easy, simple to take off, and is just awesome in general. I don't swim or anything(it's winter right now). But I'm sure that it would come off in the water as it is not waterproof. So, just watch out for that if you're a swimmer or a triathalonner. Otherwise, you're golden.",5
"Suave is a good brand because it is affordable and a good quality product.  Our family has used it for a long time. Now with thus 2 in 1 shampoo (something we rarely use) makes it an even better bargain.  The almond verbena scent was refreshing and made not only my hair small nice, but the shampoo/conditioner combination gave my hair a nice clean, soft feel and it does the job well!",5
My hair gets super clumpy when wet and takes a pretty long time to brush through it after I get out of the shower. This product is amazing. I now get out of the shower and towel dry my hair. Spray this product all over my hair and let it sit for about 2 minutes. The brush runs through my hair with such ease and I am pulling less hair out of my head. I will be rebuying this product when I run out.,5
"I've only tested this out once, but I can tell I'm going to love it once I get to using it more. It gets hot VERY fast. I had it on a medium setting and it was incredibly hot. I can only imagine what the high setting would do! It ~is~ relatively easy to burn yourself with this too, I lightly burnt my scalp a few times. A few weeks ago I got my hair cut a little shorter, basically an a-line bob looking haircut. This has made styling it SO much easier. Trying to use a straightener on the back is pretty much impossible since it's layered and short back there. I may purchase another one as a gift I like it so much.I *did* notice a slightly weird smell after the first use. I'm not sure if it was the comb reacting with the product in my hair, or just the comb itself. It kind of smelt like it was coming from the comb (Not really a burnt smell, more like.. a factory smell?), but it's not a huge problem and it didn't effect my opinion of this product at all. I have VERY thick hair, even after I got it thinned out it is a pain to to try to straighten.",5
"I liked the way that the very creamy Ponds Luminous Cleanser felt going on and found that it cleaned my face pretty well (I have an oily complexion).  I did not think that it left my skin feeling overly dry and rough, but again it could be because of my oily skin.However, I found the scent almost overpowering.  Although I like a ""clean"" scent from my cleansers, the rosey smell was much too strong for me.",3
"This is the only soap allowed in our home! It works great for out mechanic as well as for me, the housewife.",5
"Someone had given this to me because I was complaining about razor burn after shaving around the bikini area. I started applying this immediately after any shaving and it prevents rashes and breakouts. It dries my face out so I don't use it for that purpose, but for the bikin area, it's great.",4
"I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I really like it...but beware, do NOT use too much! It will make your hair greasy and heavy.  The product is thick paste almost like wax so I just swirl my fingers on the top and that is all I use for my hair (it is long...about mid-back).  It keeps the frizz down and helps it hold curl. I wash my hair at night and put it up in socks to curl it and it comes out great each morning that I use this.  It is always more frizzy when I don't use it.  It will last for a long time no more than you need to use to get the job done.",4
"This little bottle goes along way. Great for after you wash your hair and blowdry it. Gets rid of static cling and frizzy looking hair. This is lightly scent so the scent will wear off before you finish or lesve for work.  Even if you want to add polish or a nice shine, spray and brush on and your hair will look like you came out the salon.",5
"I like new gadgets and love experimenting with new hair techniques. These curl formers were way too complicated to use. It pulled the hair and caused me to break some of it. I will stick to the flexi rods.  They were easier to use and resulted in a good outcome (i.e, curls with no breakage).",1
"This five blade disposable razor has a water activated serum that provides soothing moisture.  After much badgering by his girlfriend, my brother finally decided to shave his less than impressive goatee. He used this product with a light application of shaving cream and was pleased with the results. His face is hair free and he likes the feel of his skin. He did not suffer from any nicks, cuts or irritation. He reported that the razor glided smoothly over his face. I note that he is not particularly hirsute, so those with thicker growth may be less satisfied. Its portability is a plus for travel.  Recommended.",4
"I bought this because I wanted a lip balm with SPF and really like this product. I bought it in Peony, which looks pretty red in the tube, but it's not so strong on application; rather it's like a tinted balm with a bit of a glossier look. It builds in intensity, too, so if I want a hint of color, just a swipe or two will do, but if I want more drama, I can just keep adding it on.",4
"I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!",5
"I wanted to try this shampoo as my hair is thinning and often have a dry scalp and itchy.  This shampoo has a pleasant mild scent and is very nice to use.  It goes on easily, only need a couple of capfuls on long hair and shampoos up nicely.  My hair does feel soften and scalp not as itchy.  I would recommend it as a good all around shampoo for the family to use.  Mild and pleasant.",5
"I really like this, I do my nails a lot and can't be without a quick dry product.  This is my favorite one I have used.",5
"This salicylic acid serum from Aveya Beauty comes in a 1 oz. glass bottle with a dropper.  It has a pH of 2.0, an acidity similar to that of lemon juice.  It also contains ingredients to aid in application and to moisturize the skin.It is a mild peel, but I would recommend testing it on the inner arm before applying it to the face and be careful to keep it away from the eyes.  It can be applied with a fingertip or cotton swab.  It produces a slight stinging sensation as expected with a chemical peel, but it is not overly irritating. Be sure to carefully rinse it from the skin, making sure to keep it out of the eyes.It leaves the skin feeling and looking renewed and refreshed rather than burnt.  Best results come from leaving it on the skin for a longer time, up to about ten minutes, and from repeated use.Aveya Beauty provided a sample for testing and evaluation.  This is a good-quality salicylic acid peel and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a mild, at-home facial treatment to reveal fresh skin.  It could also be used to soften calluses or corns and remove warts.",5
"I have tried so many tanning lotions, and many of them are just ""ok"" or smell awful. I absolutely love Phoenician. It smells really good, like a cologne. It is suitable for both men and women. I have never experienced an after tan odor, it smells exactly the same. The thing I like most about Phoenician is it gets me so dark. I rotate this lotion with tingles and bronzers, and I'm darker than I have ever been. It makes your skin feel very soft, and has great skincare ingredients, which is essential considering what tanning does to skin. Just get it.",5
"These are all right.  I guess like any sticker you really have to make sure that it's on there long enough for the paint to dry, but it does leave a ridge where your paint was. I guess it's a work in progress for making them work out. I'm finding that free handing it is easier.",3
I thought when I got these towelettes my makeup would come off all the way but it doesn't you need to wash your face in a shower first then use the towelettes then a soft scrub sorry but I don't know if I will purshase this item again,2
"Tresemme has always made quality products. My wife has used many of them over the years. She wanted to try this new conditioner , and who am I to say no. Her hair always looks great , so whatever she wants to use is fine with me.She says that she absolutely loves this Tresemme product. A little goes a long way , and therefore makes the product a good value for the money.Although I couldn't tell any difference before versus after , she's happy.Mission accomplished",5
"I'm not a huge fan of dry shampoos but this the Suave is the nicest one that I've tried. I recently did some damage to my hair with over processing so I have been trying to go longer between shampoos to avoid drying my hair out even more. I have been using the Suave dry shampoo once or twice a week.The nicest things about the Suave as compared to some other brands I've tried like Tresemme is that it doesn't have an unpleasant scent and it does not dispense that white powder all over my hair. I can't see this in my hair once I've sprayed it on. It does have scent but the scent is not unpleasant.It works as well. I don't have oily hair but since I'm waiting between shampoos, my scalp gets a yucky feeling and that feeling goes away as soon as I spray the Suave dry shampoo. It also leaves it smelling fresher.",5
"Can't really tell if its working or not, but it makes me feel better just to think that it might possibly be working, so I keep using since the price is reasonable.",3
I know how expensive rhinestones can be so when I saw the amazing low price on these I had to order them.Wasn't expecting much but I was happily surprised! There are so many rhinestonesin the little container and it has a great variety of colors.Cant go wrong if using for nail art because they are the perfect size.,5
"Don't believe all the hype. Like every other ""new/old"" thing out there that is rediscovered to be the best thing ever, argan oil has been purported to be able to do many miraculous things. I don't believe that and didn't base my purchase on that type of hype. What I did buy it for is for what it is supposed to do..and for that, this particular brand is absolute tops!Argan oil, which is simply the oil of the nut of the argan tree, is a lot like olive oil in many ways and the less high quality argan oils are more like olive oil than the higher quality ones. Where the differences are at between a good high quality argan and a lesser argan is in the very things that make argan superior to olive for the skin and hair.Cold pressed organic oil like this has a more delicate scent, greater absorbability, is a little thinner and works for a whole lot longer. If you've had an experience with argan oil where you looked at yourself and thought you would have done better to just rub cooking oil on yourself then you likely got some that was heated when pressed or came from inferior fruits.This particular Argan oil is just that...pure Argan oil with nothing in it. No fragrance. No additives. Nada. So it has a light, slightly nutty smell that I find heavenly.Where this oil really shows its benefits is in aging skin or very dry skin. It takes about 6 drops to moisturize my entire lower leg. Face...2 drops. Hair treatment..2 drops. Whole body, about 1 dropper full. It soaks in very fast and leaves a very slight sheen on the skin that isn't an oily one, but rather a glowy one. It lasts beyond a day. Even after a day, including showering, you can skip it if you're in a hurry and not get dry skin.I use it every day on my legs and arms. Every few days I do the whole body. Once a week I use it on my face after a facial and in my hair once a week to keep it sleek. If you're a teen with unruly skin prone to acne and oily hair then I would test it first to be sure it is okay with your skin and hair. For everyone else, it is a delight and highly recommended.",5
"These arrived earlier than expected and well packaged, nice color selection. I wish there was a size variety but it's ok. I like them thanks!",4
"I love this product!  I got a small sample of this from sephora and waited and waited to try it because I didn't think I would like it.  I tried it out of desperation today and wow!! I am super impressed, and surprised!  I have tried a few bb creams, but nothing like this one.  The finish is powdery and light.  The powdery feeling is great for fighting oily spots, great for combination skin.  It feels really silky on your face and not sticky at all, in fact it's the exact opposite of sticky.  Makes my face super smooth!  I got light but it is VERY pale, I'm going to need medium, but other than that, it's surprisingly great.",5
"maximum retinol I can get over the counter. absorbs well, no smell and can be worm under make-up.  I like that it also has vitamin A",3
"The first thing I like about this shampoo is the fragrance. It boasts &#34;jasmine and exotic florals.&#34; It smells nice without being overpowering and the lovely fragrance stays in my hair after washing, which I prefer. It only takes a little bit to wash my hair. As I am frugal at heart, this should last me quite a while and stretch my pennies. I have used this shampoo and coordinating conditioner exclusively and have noticed my hair looks and feels smooth for at least 3 days and then I wash my hair anyway. I do recommend this product.",4
My brother said they stopped producing this at one point...so he was really excited when I gave it to him as a gift. Gotta love online shopping!,5
In the store these are so expensive and I planed to never get any but seen these and I'm so happy!! Sooooo  much for your money!,5
"Bought this a few weeks ago, my skin looks amazing! I'm 56 years old and have taken really good care of my skin, moisturizing daily and tons of sunscreen, but adding this to my regimen has yielded fabulous results. Dewy, plump skin is what I get when I use this underneath my regular moisturizer It has &#34;plumped&#34; my skin up and helped fill in the wrinkles. The best way to use this product is to put it on immediately after you wash and pat your face dry; I would recommend this to anyone who takes their aging skincare issues seriously. Great stuff and worth the price!",5
"I have curly, over-processed hair and it tends to be fairly dry. I tried this  ""pudding"" on my hair and have to say I wasn't really impressed. It helped with the fly-aways but didn't really seem to hydrate my curls like I had hoped. I did like that this product is not sticky. Be sure not to use too much though because it can really weigh the hair down. As far as the scent goes, I would have to say it was pleasant and light.",3
Again all natural. I love all natural products. This is great. I order avocado and caster oil. The texture the packaging everything about it I love!,5
"I love Viviscal hair supplements, have used them for more than a year. I have medium/thick hair but it was thinning from a lot of highlights and color. Really worked to make my hair grow faser and get healthy again. Takes about 3 months to see some results though.",5
I have been very impressed with this cream and it does seem to have a regenerative effect on my skin.  I am approaching middle age and having young children later in life does add a bit of extra wear and tear on me (even though they also add joy).  Since starting this cream my skin is not only looking younger but I have that glow that I just assumed I would not have in quite the same way again.,5
"I have used just about everything from the ORS brand (Organic Root Stimulator) and I havent been disappointed yet so I was so eager to try the HAIRepair line upon seeing the print ads for the line in numerous magazines.I already own and love the HAIRepair Polisher. Such would be my luck that my local BSS didnt have any of the HAIRepair line so I ordered off Amazon. When I saw the great ingredient listed in the HAIRepair Nourishing Conditioner I knew I was in for a treat. It has banana extract which is very moisturizing for your hair and bamboo extract which helps to strengthen hair against breakage. I was soeager to try this conditioner & I was thrilled with my results. The conditioners smells fabulous! The consistency is almost like a banana pudding. It glides through your hair easily. If you are a fan of the ORS Olive Oil Replenishing Pak/conditioner you already know how my hair felt upon rinsing.....like butter! Soft,easily detangled,moist and almost no hair in the comb during the detangling process. The moisturized soft feeling didnt leave my hair after my hair was dried. The feeling lasted for days. IMO ORS has  another staple product in my hair care arsenal. I will repurchase. You wont be disappointed with the companion HAIRepair products .",5
"This product smells great. The only thing is the bottle is too small...you run out quick. Plus the infomercials about this product don't really work for everyone. I have long hair, that I had to part into sections to handle. With my normal shampoo/conditioner I never had that problem. Smells great but the results with my normal shampoo/condition are better. Just my opinion.",4
I wanted to use something to control my edges and thought that this would work but it is really greasy/oily. It smells good but it just didn't work for my hair.Apparently it works for others so I wouldn't just go off of my review. It's always great to try new things and it isn't pricey. I would say that if you have thin hair to try it. My hair is pretty coarse and really curly so once the product went on the curls just stuck back up.,3
"This is the only Avani product that is probably okay that I have tried, I am sure there are much better moisturizing creams out there though...Its okay, nothing spectacular, dont waste your $.",3
You can wrong with some suppliers but this product is true to it's name.  Great Argan oil.  I use it on my face and you will notice the difference the very first day. Some products claim that but this will leave you skin silky smooth. Use at morning and evening.  love this. I highly recommend.  You may only need 2 drops. not droppers full just a few drops in the palm of your hand for great moisturizer and skin health.,5
I really love the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner; for one thing my hair breaks far less with this duo than with any other products I've ever tried. I did not find that this mask garnered any extra special results over using the regular conditioner though.Will definitely stick with Carol's Daughter/Monoi but just not the mask.,3
"There's just no getting away from it - I love Neutrogena products, and almost anything from their skincare line. The stuff has a marvelous texture, a great scent, and it just works with no issues.So as a lifelong Neutrogena babe, I can say this is a nice cream. It goes on smoothly, disappears almost instantly, and provides a continuous, energetic lift to the skin.I can't say per se if it improves wrinkles, mostly because I don't have many (but then, that may well be because I've used Neutrogena my whole life!)My current favorite Neutrogena line is the Visibly Firm with Copper line. That seems to be a little more drastic series of products (some people have complained of issues with the copper reacting with their skin.) I happen to love it, and I even use that cream for the back of my hands (never too soon to start working on the anti-aging all over!)I tried this cream for that, and it works wonderfully well for moisturing the hands, part. the delicate skin on the tops.Good overall cream, good addition to the Neutrogena line. I'll definitely keep it in mind when the company inevitably discontinues the Visibly Firm products (that always happens to me - I love a product, it disappears from the shelves.)You just can't go wrong with anything Neutrogena.",4
"My first flat iron was relatively inexpensive because I wasn't sure how much I'd use it.  The temp dial was almost impossible to read, and although  I liked how my hair looked I knew I wasn't doing my hair any favors by using it too often--my hair is fine and a bit fragile.  So I was thrilled to try this for comparison.  Here's what I love about the Remington S8500DS Flat Iron:1) Heats up incredibly fast2) the easy-to-read digital temp display is TERRIFIC!!  I didn't realize how much I would appreciate it until I started using this3) the auto shut-off is a great peace of mind benefit4) the argan oil-infused plates definitely make my hair shinier and smoother--I feel less guilty about using the iron with this feature5) my hair glides through these ceramic plates--no tangles or hair getting caught6) it's affordable; I cannot justify spending $150+ on a flat iron, but at this price I wouldn't hesitateBUY IT and make your hair beautiful and happy!UPDATE 12/20/12:  Another thing I really like about this flat iron is the plates are a full inch longer than my old cheap flat iron, so I can iron more hair at one time and make the job quicker!  Still love everything about it.",5
"I was hesitant about buying this, and researched many other products similar to this. This kit is very convenient, though once I start running out, I think it makes more sense to replace certain items with generics, such as alcohol pads, and nail polish remover. No reason to spend extra money, and that's what those thing essentially are.I use this in between my salon gel manicures, which allows me to go approximately every month a half as opposed to every 2-3 weeks, which is nice on a budget.I did not find it hard to apply at all.  The LED light was super convenient, even though I was hesitant about getting a smaller lamp.  Its the perfect size, and very convenient.  You apply each step, exactly as you would a nail polish. If you use sparingly (as directions state, thin layer), it doesn't leak, and doesn't get stuck to your fingers.  And it really does COMPLETELY dry in a flash!The only con (but not worth taking any stars away) is that there isn't a vast choice of colors available.  The colors are limited, so you have to be happy with what's available.  Also, because the light is the LED (not UV) there are also less brands who make compatible gel nail polish.  I still like the LED better, because it dries faster.Lastly, I ordered the &#34;Shall we Dance&#34; color, and it's not quite as pale pink as the box shows.  My polish was more of a light bubble gum color, as opposed to faint, pale pink.Overall - definitely recommend.",5
"The clipper is well made. The alignment is good and blades are sharp.  If you have tough nails, this would be a good choice.  If your nails are average, there is no reason to spend the extra money.  The slight extra force needed to operate a conventional set of clippers does not justify the extra price.",5
"I'm a big Burt's Bees fan, they do make some stellar natural care products. I would have &#34;loved&#34; this more but I found an issue with it - sometimes it was 'roll' off my skin, in these little like granules. I may have simply received a lotion too close to it's expiration date. Otherwise I did love this product: it has a herbal scent to it. it absorbs quickly, can be used under makeup/sunblock, worked on my adult acne. And my acne is: large pores that clog easily, small pimples from hormones, sometimes a few zits. This has helped greatly to reduce the frequency, size and duration of acne. It's very nice to have more clear skin again at my age, I'd say give this a shot!",4
Love the makeup and the name brand I like how it apply on the face love the fact how fast i received it. Thank You,5
"So, I wear lashes a lot. These are my standbys when I dont have my regular Go-To lashes. They are more plastic looking so dont expect natural look with these. They are more dramatic looking too.",2
"How much can I say about a hair conditioner?  I buy really expensive stuff at my salon which is better, but it's like 5 times the price.  Of course, a bottle lasts months, so it's worth it.  But I tried this and it was pretty darn close.  So 5 stars all around!",5
You cannot go wrong with gel nail polish.  I use this every single day.  One coat is light and two coats are very pink.,5
I purchased this at my local Walgreen's last year. I chose this one because I have chronic tendonitis and heavy hair dryers give me a bad flare-up.The good:It's very lightweight and cute.The bad:The low setting is so low that it takes me twice as long to dry my hair which is a source of pain for those of us with tendonitis or arthritis.The high setting is too high in that it gives off a burning smell even though there is no dust inside.It's structurally cheaply made and often feels like it's going to fall apart while I'm using it which makes me nervous given that it's an electrical device.I have since purchased the Revlon Compact Styler which is a bit heavier but not too heavy for me and has cut my drying time in half.,1
"this line of L'Oreal products is sulfate free...so it is gentle and less harming to your hair.  My daughter uses it and says it leaves her hair soft and healthy, and gives her hair some body.",4
"This is a fine curling wand. I have long hair, and I had previously bought a 3/4 inch barrel much more expensive brand. It made tighter curls. The reviewers who are saying they have a ""bob"" or 6-inch long hair, why are you buying such a big barrel?? No need to give a bad review for that. This heats up well and gives big loose curls for girls with longer hair which is what I wanted. Definitely does the job for the price. Buy it!",5
"I must be the exception because I haven't read anything about this happening to anyone else!I have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper & has great reviews. I have used it for a little over a week and my face, neck, & chest (everywhere I was using it) started breaking out worse than ever!! I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind. I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :( After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of Acne Free- PLUS the box says you will see results in 3 days- well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!! It could be that I am having an allergic reaction to on of the added ingredients, there's no way to tell but I am taking it back because it's obviously not going to work for me like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it. Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning & night because I know that makes all the difference. Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.****On a good note***** I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face, no makeup removing cloths required which is unlike Proactive which requires that I remove makeup before using the face wash because it simply doesn't do the job :  an added expense!!!) They need to hurry up and make Proactive cheaper in my opinion! They've made enough money already!!!",2
"Hello, my name is Leah Marie and I am a bit of a hair products junkie.  It started when I hit puberty.  First, I would pilfer my mother's products.  Soon, I was a complete addict - spending all of my babysitting money on gels and mousses.* Shampoos* Clarifiers* Conditioners* Glosses* Glazes* Temporary color* Leave-in conditioners* Smoothers, thickening spray, beach hair spray......I've tried it all.I have my favorites (like Hemp's now-discontinued orange shine spray and Aveda's Damage Remedy), but I am too liberal to remain beholden to one line.I ordered this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.  I have tried other fabulous hair products courtesy the Vine Program, like Toni and Guy's Leave In Conditioner.  Unfortunately, this product is NOT fabulous.  The conditioner did not leave my hair soft or smooth.  The worst part of it:  IT SMELLS NASTY.  No lovely perfume or clean soapy smell.  No botanicals or fruits.  It smells like Mr. Clean.  That would be great if I was mopping my bathroom floor but who wants to toss their hair and smell chemicals?***Also, the shampoo that goes with this conditioner was horrendous.  It left my hair feeling stripped and dry (even when it was soaking wet)...and that was only after one application!  By day seven, I looked like the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.Sorry Tresemme, I am a human not a scarecrow.",3
"I have not used this product brand before.  At first when I tried this product I thought it was the product itself which was appearing to be peeling but I was wrong.  It really does peel old, dead skin off. It is just one more way to exfoliate your skin.  It reminds me of the pedicure creams I use to use which rolled the dead skin off the feet.  I always thought that was so amazing! Skin does feel soft after use.  I cannot comment on long term benefits of using this yet, so will try to remember to do an update later.  I would not pay the suggested retail price for this but the price I got it for on Amazon is reasonable and I was willing to try it.",5
"These hot rollers are the bomb they don't get tangled in your fair cool to touch no burns and very nice curl, This was a great purchase",5
"Have tried many body washes..dove, aveeno..etc.  I ranked Aveeno Daily Mositurizing the best, until I tried Olay.  I definitely like the Olay Ultra Moisture Body Wash with Shea Butter better than the Aveeno.  Add a little Nivea Smooth Sensation and I (the dry skin one) am good to go.  Skin has ""never"" felt so good.  Purchased a 3 pack at Costco for around $12.",5
"not bad.  Not fantastic, a bit difficult to use but the items are pretty.  I'd recommend this product to someone with experience applying the things.  If you're new at it like me, you might find it difficult as I did.",3
i love the idea of loose powder...the only complaint is that i probably picked the wrong color for me a little dark for my fair skin..maybe i'll try a lightier color.,4
"I bought this to apply under-eye concealer and I love the curvature. It fits perfectly underneath my eyes! But it's a bit hard to apply cream concealer directly from the pan; instead, I dab some on on my skin with my fingers and blend with this brush.So in summary, good brush to blend, but not apply!",4
"The price seems a little steep for what you actually get. It works pretty well at keep your nails in good condition. It does what it says, and really gives your nails a bit of shine. It doesn't seem like this nail block/file will last too long. If it was cheaper I would probably repurchase after the one I have is worn out.",3
"I found that this conditioner is great when I want to just cowash my very curly hair mid-week to restyle.  It has a lovely, fresh citrus scent and gently cleanses and conditions my hair.  It contains cocamidopropyl betaine high on the ingredient list which is a cleansing agent. It leaves my kinky/curly hair soft, fresh and not weighed down...perfect if you follow the curly girly method. Also the big bottle with the pump is great in the shower!",5
"I have very fine hair and this just did not clean it well enough. I wanted to like it, but it left my hair pretty oily.",2
"Easy to hold bottle, pleasing scent on the shampoo. It lathered very well and rinsed cleanly, paired up with the conditioner, it left my hair feeling very soft and clean. The only bad thing about it, was how it was shipped, in a bubble wrap manilla envelope. Being shipped like that, caused the bottle to leak a bit, not a lot, but I did have to rinse the bottle off before use. Other then that, it's great.",5
It did not remove my eye make up. It washed off cleanly but did not remove my mascara or eyeliner.,1
This product is great! It is well made and everything! Great price for a great deal! If you were to order this you would be getting it for a steal. Overall what I am saying is this is a really great product and I recommend it.,5
Great cleanser for helping you with those blackheads. I love the fact that it warms when you are spreading it on your face. This is a staple in my cleaning routine and I will be using this for years and years!,5
"I have been using this product for many years now, it came recommended by my doctor of 13  years, whom I highly trust. I love it, will never stop using it.",5
"I used this serum both in the AM and PM, after eye cream and before moisturizer. The product is dispensed with a little dropper, and I tended to use 5-6 drops.  It applies very easily and dries really quickly, and it is not sticky at all.  The product page states that it has the &#34;faintest citrus scent&#34;, but there needs to be more emphasis on faint as there is really not any fragrance to speak of at all.I did not notice any immediate results, but it would be difficult to see many changes in a month's time. That said, I have read numerous good things about the benefits of incorporating a Vitamin C Serum into your beauty routine, so I will happily continue to use this bottle.",3
"Not only were regular manicures getting expensive, but I had some temporary nail bed damage. So I started looking for a cuticle remover I could use at home and, based on customer reviews, picked this one. It does exactly what it should -- remove dead, excess cuticle without the need for trimming. I just put it on with a q-tip and leave it on until it starts to sting a bit. Then I scrub it off with a nail brush and I'm ready to remove nail polish and finish my own, inexpensive manicure. Hooray!",5
Not quite as dense as I wanted the brush but regardless it still puts your eyeliner on great. Good stuff,4
This stuff gave me one of the worst headaches I've ever had. I also was super nauseous after taking it. I didn't even try again.,2
"Very fast shipping and delivery, product arrived with box crushed, but doesn't matter since the bottle and sponge are ok. Well at least I don't mind. Very light shade with easy blending texture, medium coverage ideal for natural nude makeup, non greasy and matches skin. I have tried Dior BB cream, smash box CC cream... but I can see myself using this one for a long time since I decided to give my skin a break : )",5
"I'm an expert on sensitive skin products.  I'm also insanely sensitive to nearly everything. My Asperger's, genes, sensitive skin, Roscia, and ADD are who to give thanks for that .! I have no dermatology degree but, in this department I intimidate them big time. With that said, I try nearly everything I rate that claims it's unscented or sensitive skin and actually seams to be. I do this for everything except some makeup.  Detergents, skin products, eye masks, clothing, hair products, bedding, ect. Unlike Paula Begone for example who doesn't but, who also knows her stuff. ! She's impressed but my knowledge too. With that said this is the best price around for this and this product has a couple impressive ingredients and doesn't have too many overall , which is great.! The only known ingredient that concerns me is Magnesuim Sulfate. It is VERY drying. Also, I have heightened senses, but  this has a slight smell on application and after of an unscented bug spray ( the only way I know how to describe it) . Yuck!  Truly unscented and fragrance free products still can have a slight smell to them. But, there only of product ingredient scents. That should be irritant free and healthy for everyone.  Bug spray scent to humans is unhealthy. Another weird thing is there are two unknown ingredients in this product,  The other ingredients I know what they are fortunately and none are regular ingredients in bug spray that would cause that slight scent.  Instead I recommend Elta MD Sport Skin care lotion which is a lot better. I tried this, and like I said, it does some of what it claims while it dries u up and smells a little really bad. One more thing, on application and a little after it too. It makes my face and neck get a burning feeling too.!",2
This is 100% castor oil.  SUPER thick and sticky but it leaves your hair feeling so soft and touchable...its amazing.  I add this oil to shea butter for my hair creams and it whips to perfection.  I also used it alone after cowashing and my hair was sooooo soft.  It is VERY thick so be careful.  I noticed a big difference in the softness and strength of my hair when I used this product alone.,5
Ordered this after watching a youtube tutorial on nail stamping. I could not get my nail stamper to work for me. That was until I got this polish! It's soooooo much easier to use my stamping set with this polish. Now I just need to get other colors!,5
"I love having wipes handy in my purse for cleaning my hands if I can't wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we're out. I especially keep a pack handy if we're on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair.These are sensitive skin, though, so they're not antibacterial. I wonder how clean they get my hands if I'm going to be eating.Pros:ConvenientSmall packagesDoesn't come open in your purseBecause they're in individual packs, you can hand them out to others and not have to keep opening a large pack",4
"I LOVE THIS STUFF!! It has made such a difference in my skin since I started using it. I am a man and I work outside. I use to have dry ruff skin all over. I FOUND A CURE FOR THAT. It takes a little while but it is fun if you have someone close that can help you.First I would suggest you get a &#34;AXE Detailer Shower Tool&#34; you can get them from Amazon or in the stores.You DO need a partner or someone VERY CLOSE to you. You can do this in the shower but it is much better on a bed or massage table. Cover the bed so it will not get wet. Have the person lie on the bed nude. You need a small bucket, very warm water, a towel,and hopefully the AXE Detailer Shower Tool .  Get the towel wet but not too wet Start on the back of the neck and continue down the back getting it wet apply the Nivea body scrub not to much a little goes a long way. Start scrubbing the neck and back and arms in a circular motion with the shower tool, take your time, don't rush. Continue down the gluts and the back of the legs. Don't miss any area. When the back side is finished. Take another wet towel and wipe as much of the scrub off the body as you can. Now is a good time to scrub the bottom of the feet. Have the person turn over Now is the time to do the face DON'T use the scrub on the face. Instead use the &#34;NIVEA MEN ENERGY FACE SCRUB IT is easer on the face. Scrub the face good. Leave the scrub on the face while you continue down the front of the body. Do a good job on the front. When finished wipe the front off as you did the back. On the face if you can leave the scrub on the face until the shower.NOW turn about is fair play get your partner down on the bed and start scrubbing. When BOTH of you are done if you have a shower that is big enough for two, both of you step in . Here I use &#34;NIVEA MEN ACTIVE 3 SPORT BODY WASH&#34; all over the body including the face. Wash each other really good and get all the body scrub off the body. Now dry off really good. Here is the last step. change the towels on the bed and replace with dry ones. The second person lie down on the bed face down. At this point I use'&#34;NIVEA MEN EXPRESS ABSORPITION REVITALIZING SKIN LOTION&#34;This lotion absorbs into the skin quickly and dries quickly.When you are done on him and if he has enough strength  have him do you.I have completed 3 of these sessions and I can say without question my skin looks and feels 20 years younger. I have a masseuseand she can't believe the difference in my skin.",5
I do not understand the function of this water. For me it is just useless thing.I will not recommend it.,3
"I was SO HAPPY when I discovered this in the isles of Walmart. A natural face cleanser with the Neutrogena name? Brilliant. I checked out the ingredient list of course, and then impulsively purchased it. All the ingredients are plant-derived except for one (I think. I don't have the bottle with me). It has a liquid (more on the gel side than the water-y side) consistency and a weird smell - not bad, but definitely shouldn't be made into a perfume anytime soon. Some days, I would dilute it a bit with water and some days, I wouldn't but I always got the same results in the shower: stinging and after the shower: not that great.It wasn't a horrible cleanser (my face did feel clean), but it didn't give me results that I wanted. It made my combination skin quite flaky and greasy...not oily, but greasy and while it cleared some whiteheads on the sides of my face, it gave me acne on my neck...It was weird. I don't like it, but I will have to try the other products before I can completely discard this one as I really liked that the packaging was ""green"" (the ink was printed onto the bottle and not paper on top of the bottle). And if I remember right, the ink was made of soy. But I could be wrong. Overall, it was just a weird experience.",2
"I always order Smoke when I need a quick tan! This gets me really dark, but if I use it too often too many times in a row I get orangy so I switch it up! Be sure and wash your hands after tanning and rub in very well around wrist and fingers when you are applying it to body.",4
This product arrived ahead of schedule as was as described.  The only reason that I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that many of the rhinestone shapes are mixed together and I have a difficult time trying to sort them out when I am working on my nails.,4
This product smells awesome. I like using this as a deep conditioner with a heating cap. I am almost 3 months natural so my hair is short. I cant wait for my hair to grow so that I can try this for other  natural hairstyles. It smells good enough to eat. LOL,5
"It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all. When I use it, it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes. I'm using as directed, so I feel  it's not that effective. Also, it is moisturizing but too 'oily' for me. I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes. I think it's all right but I wouldn't purchase again. Almay's makeup remover pads did a much better  job but they were somewhat drying ... so I'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover",2
It has a nice fragrance but I was hoping it would help to make my hair less frizzy than if I didn't use it.  My hair was soft but still frizzy.,3
"With so many great ingredients, I can see why people are so impressed with this product. I am in my late twenties and wanted to get a serum to add to my skincare routine. I am starting to notice lines on my forehead and smile lines. While it is too early to say if these issues will be helped, I can say that this is a great serum. It works great at night or during the day. Makeup applies great over it. Also, the packaging is great. I love the pump which is great for keeping any bacteria at bay.",5
"This is a beautiful colour and it stays put for a very long time. I didn't like how hard it is to remove, however. It also has a weird texture",5
"Overall it's an okay body wash. It doesn't dry your skin out, and it has a rich lather to it. I really don't care too much about the exfoliating beads. They provide some exfoliation, but not a whole lot. The beads are too big and don't rinse off too easily. This is sub par compared to other dove body washes.",3
"Beautiful, good quality, excellent pricing and bigger than it looks in the pic!  All around an A+!  I bought this for my mom for Christmas and it looks so pretty in her hair!",5
"I buy Sauve products all the time.  There's nothing extraordinary about it, except, it simply cleans your hair and the conditioner gives it a nice body.Hair care products don't have to be expensive to work.  Suave proves that time and time again.The Rainforest scent is quite nice.",5
"I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)",5
"I hate winter and all its skin and hair drying glory.  I have long, thick, and very porous Asian hair.  That said, my hair thankfully absorbs most what is put on it, but generally reacts poorly to whatever it disagrees with.  If a product is too thick, my hair will look limp and pathetic.  If a product doesn't work well enough, my hair will stay dry and rear its ugly little split ends at me.  Thankfully, my hair seemed to agree with Motions Marula Hair Oil.  I only used one spritz, since I didn't want to get the buttery prawn look.  I spritzed on freshly blown dried hair (I take showers in the evening, and blow dry), brushed through with a paddle brush, and finished with a light blow dry to help spread all that oil around.  Initially my hair looked oily, but after the brush and low heat, the product seemed to absorb in my hair and looked nice and shiny.  The added softness was a bonus plus.I use this oil on alternating days with other leave in conditioner products and find my hair to be soft, manageable, and just pleasant to touch now.  While I wouldn't suggest using this in large amounts, it's great in small amounts for gentle moisturizing.  Recommended.",4
Great brush for  liquid foudation or to apply powder! Feels like a good quality brush without being pricey! Will recommend this brush!!,5
"This stuff dries within under a minute! Seriously, if you're impatient with waiting for your nails to dry, you need to get this top coat!",5
"This Banana Boat sunscreen did not work well at all for me.  I have a fair complexion and burn rather easily, so I use a lot of sunscreen.  I was excited to try this product because I have used other Banana Boat sun products in the past and thought they worked well.  However, even with a short exposure to the sun, I experienced some sunburn every time I used it.  I tried spraying it on heavy and rubbing it in, but it seemed to evaporate far too quickly to really rub it in.  I have used other SPF 30 products, like Coppertone Continuous Spray and found that they protected quite well.  I don't know why the Banana Boat sunscreen didn't work, only that it failed to provide any protection from the sun.It does spray nicely, however, even upside down which is a plus.  It also has a pleasant scent to it.  It maybe that it will work for people with less sensitive skin, but I would advise against using this product.",2
"This is my new favorite eyeliner!  It goes on super smoothly and evenly and the long tapered applicator is perfect for the cat-eye look.  Once dry, it stays in place well.  The only occasions I have noticed smudging were in extreme heat or rain, which makes sense as it is not waterproof.  Even at these times, smudging was minimal (not running down my face).  The price is fantastic.  I will definitely be buying again.",5
"This color is one of my favorite summer pinks. I wouldn't say this is a neon pink, as I have couple of neon pinks gel colors from other brands, but I would say it's a great summer pink...a true pink. Not a pepto-bismol pink as I have found others to be. Very pleased with this color. A definite must have!",5
Nice softening creme. Cannot beat the price,5
This is a very large comb. I haven't noticed a big difference from the infused oils but I do like the wide spacing between the teeth. I haven't used this on wet hair yet but I'm looking forward to doing so.,4
My mom is 55 and she is always trying to improve on her image and facial appearance. She said this has saved her. She says she feels and looks 45 again. Im happy she is happy.,5
"The product description does not have a complete ingredient listing.  Here it is:Cocamidopropyl Betaine (skin conditioning/cleansing agent), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate (cleansing agent), Glycerin (moisturizer), Methylchoroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone (preservative), Citric Acid (ph Balance), Tangerine Fragrance.According to the Environmental Working Group, cocamidopropyl betaine has been ""associated with irritation and allergic contact dermatitis.""SCENT:  The scent of this product is very, very mild.  I typically have sensitivity to strong smells and with few exceptions do not like scents to linger on the skin.  This soap out of the bottle doesn't have much of a scent.  The scent is citrus infused, but it would be difficult for me to classify it as tangerine based without looking at the bottle.  The scent dissipates almost immediately after use.CLEANSING:  The soap is dispensed as a foam.  However, the foam washes away very quickly.  I don't know if this is due to hard water or some ingredient, but I did not feel like I could get a solid thirty seconds of washing out of a pump or two.  The soap did not leave my hands soft, and in Ohio's cold weather, I need something that provides additional moisturizers.BOTTLE: I have not had problems with the bottle dispensing product.  It pumps easily, but again, the longevity of the product for washing purposes is not long.  This type of bottle enables you to turn other favorite soaps into foam soaps.  Just squirt product in the bottle and fill with water.  I think I will do that will these bottles once I have exhausted my supply.  The bottom of the bottle is made with #2 plastic, which is recyclable in most communities.OVERALL IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that I love that the bottle is recyclable and can be used to turn other favorite soaps into foam soaps.  I am not fond of the product itself.  It did not leave my hands soft and the speed with which it washed off was not favorable.This product is made in the United States.This product is not tested on animals.",3
"It's hard for me to find a perfume I like. There are only 2 fragrances as of right now I enjoy enough I could wear every day, and this is one of them. The other, is Pure Poison By Christian Dior. Angel is the exact opposite of my other all time favorite, it's light and delicate. It's my favorite summertime fragrance, since it's not heavy or overpowering. It's made from sparkling plum, sheer violet and amber.The bottle is stunning. Very large (even more so than I though it would be), it seems to last forever. I have been wearing this perfume almost every day for 3 months and I've barely gone though a small portion of it. It's a beautiful heavy glass bottle with large opaque wings wings on the back of it. The spritzer works perfectly and dispenses just the right amount. The whole perfume bottle itself looks beautiful and extremely unique.Smells amazing and lasts forever, this perfume is one of my all time favorites!",5
"I typically use Burt's Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy). I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause. Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product. It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can't do it. Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but nope; NADA.Also, if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS...READ THE LABEL! This product is not what it is marketed to be.",1
"Professional hair stylists love this product for a reason- it works! It holds your hair, is brushable and makes your hair shiny. Perfect!",5
"I usually use theOlay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. This product is very similar, but a little most costly. It works well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. The presentation is very nice; the container looks lovely sitting on my counter. This has the same classic look and smell of Olay products. It works well, although I can't speak to its ability to fade dark spots, as I am luckily not there yet.However, for the cost difference, I will stick with the Olay product I was using previously.Edit: After finishing this container and going back to my previous Regenerist product, I think I actually like the new verision better. I'm upping my review to 5 stars.",5
"Sunblock is necessary to keep skin young! This offers a full 30SPF while still feeling like a lotion. I break out from or have an allergic reaction to most products, even soap, but I can use this stuff everyday without a reaction. I have to wash it off at night or I'll get zits, but I think that normal of anything.",5
"Great value for the price, much cheaper than sold in the local pharmacy. It works like conditioiner- not sure what else to say. Detangles well and smells great.",5
I used to fiddle about cutting my nails cos ordinary clippers don't let u go down to far so u either trim a little at time or cut one side then next which makes the nail week in middle an they split. This tool is wonderful as u just put your nails through to where u whant it clipped. It's like a hand held giulletine lol,5
"After testing several different brands of Argan oil at different price points, I feel the Mogador 100% Pure Argan Oil is a great value. I do believe it is pure argan oil, and I received all of the benefits associated with high quality oil. My skin was more luminous and I had reduction in the number of blemishes and inflammation on my face. I also use this oil in my hair to help smooth the hair shaft.",4
I usually love Suave products but this purchase was a let down. The lotion was very watery and when I put it on my skin there was no hydrating effect. It was a waste of time to apply it everyday so I threw the bottle away.,1
"I am enjoying this healing clay!  Luxurious and powerful home spa experience.  Put on some music, light a candle or two, run a nice hot bath, apply this mask -- and relax!  You can feel the drawing power of this clay as soon as you put it on your face... I tend to have dryer skin so I worried a bit that I had left it on too long -- but had no issues whatsoever.  My face and neck felt smooth and my skin was tighter and firmer after the mask treatment -- plus, it just feels SO CLEAN!  I love this product!",5
It is so creamy and gorgeous!  I got lots of compliments when I wore this color.  The polish is pricey but worth every penny.  This will be my go to medium brown.  It is the perfect consistency.,5
"Its like wearing falsies without all the trouble! Goes on super smooth and its the perfect black. When you make a mistake it comes off your face easily too, but lasts all day!The only con: it flakes if you touch it",5
"Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel works decently but it isn't the best gel out there. You have to use a lot to get a good look, and it leaves your hair greasier than it really should be even with using gels. Overall just ok.",3
"""Shampoo & conditioner left hair, soft & manageable. Why 4 rating - FRAGRANCE - The strong argan smell and then additionally added fragrance - TOO MUCH - Passed both products along after a week. Companies ""every product should not have fragrance"" - common sense - fragrances conflict amongst the different products. Now add in sensitivities, its a chemical nightmare.""""",3
this comb i use in my shower to detangle my hair and it just goes right through my hair without any trouble.,5
"This applies and performs well like most Gelish colors. The color is a deep blue which shows purple flecks in strong, direct light. Most of the time it  just looks dark navy or black. I wish the flecks showed more but it is still nice, especially with denim.",4
I was impressed when I recieved in the mail.  Its a beautiful hair clip.  I'm not sure what I will wear with yet.,5
Very Nice Mascara.... It does extend the lashes :D,5
These brushes are very comparable to the high-end brushes you would buy from the mall or expensive makeup stores. The difference is they're affordable and eco-friendly. Very soft brushes and hair does not fall out even after washing them every 2 weeks to maintain care. Great quality for price paid!,5
"As with all NYX round lipsticks, the consistency is extremely creamy. This color comes off as mauve/rose with neutral undertones.",5
"No special skin problems, but this soap (in concert with softened water) feels really soft and gentle and seems to offer a really thorough cleansing.  No aroma, and while it is a bit pricey, it seems to last.  Use it all over, but I'd say that it would be quite nice as a facial bar only.  A small luxury that gives the day a nice start.",5
"This product is ideal for humid weather! Living in the caribbean make up melt down is almost inevitable! I love the fact that this base helps prolong my make up wear. I have really oily skin and enlarged pores so its powder like texture gives a nice smooth, matte finish! What I find also helps prolong makeup wear is all nighter by urban decay! Hope this was of some help.",5
"I use this to cover my purplish under eye circles. A little goes a LONG way for me since I use such a small amount of it. I use a very small concealer brush from e.l.f, and take a little dab of this concealer with the tip. I cover just the area that is purple under my eye and use the brush to spread it around roughly. Then I take my pinky and blend, blend, blend! Always cover this product with skin tone concealer, or it'll look super weird. This product is very thick with good pigmentation. The jar isn't very big, but like I said, a little goes a long way. I used to use just my fingers to apply this product, touch the pad of my finger and press lightly to get enough concealer and then apply.. but I kept gouging my nail into the product in the pot! I highly recommend you purchase a small concealer brush to go along with this.Tips:*Remember to blend!*Make sure to moisturize well before applying*Use skin colored concealer on top of this concealer, the yellow tint is to cancel out the purple of dark under eye circles, but it won't look natural without the skin colored concealer on top*Set everything with a little powder and you're good to go!",4
I do not like this eye shadow at all.  It is way too glittery and heavy.  It is not for everyday use or people.  Natural...I don't think so.,2
"I am a nail tech and I own ALLOT of white polish. I really like the Konad White Polish because it stamps clean, crisp and bright every time. I have tried stamping with other polishes and I have not been impressed with my stampings. I use this polish with my Konad plates and other plates. The image always does the best job, even on shallow stamping plates.",5
"I thought those 11's between my brows were here to stay..seeing that I developed them from over 15 years of suffering from migraines, but after one week they are barely noticeable.  I naturally, was also using anti wrinkle products in addition to these but before I got the FROWNIES here ( BTW best price on the web) I was using the anti wrinkle products alone &  wasn't seeing any results!  I'm so glad I leaned about these in one of my searches!",5
"The tip is sharp and the loop end helps, but isn't very good for blackheads. I find a hairpin extracts blackheads better with out bruising.Easy to clean and shipping was quick =]",4
I love this for my hands they are looking less dry from this cold weather and younger by using this! Now if I can keep my little one from thinking he has to use it!!!,5
wish  it wasnt as many french tips image are a nice size to. use it often. will want to try other ones,5
"It smelled good in the bottle. It smelled ok, not great, on me for like 5 minutes. Then it turned from fragrance to the scent of perspiration, and the drydown later that night had me smelling like a stripper's crotch after a night of working (minus the cigarettes). The worst part was that I simply could not get rid of the scent, it gets into EVERYTHING.This is why I am really cautious when choosing perfume. I always get burned.",2
I love this product.It ads so much moisture to your skin/face without looking shiny.  Withing minutes your skin feels so soft and the tiny lines look softer!  I've used this a week or longer and I can honestly say I am seeing the results....even in the deeper wrinkles on the upper lip and at eye point.  I will continue to purchase,5
"Perhaps I have the wrong hair type for this- I think it would work better with dry or fine hair. I didn't notice any particular ""glossing"" when I was done. Other than that it's a since, serviceable shampoo.",3
"I kept getting scabs on my scalp, like you get on wounds... After a few uses of this shampoo, they seem to have gone away.  I tried everything prior to this, coal tar shampoo, tea tree shampoo, nothing worked.  And this stuff does.... plus, it leaves my hair nice and soft and shiny....",5
When I ordered this item I realize I really wasn't putting my makeup on the right way and this product I love it now I'm putting it on the right way it brings out the brightness of these sweet colors so yes love love this product thank you for selling something to women so awsome!,5
"I thought I was being very clever, saving money buying this instead of the Josie Maran Argan Oil I tried at Sephora. But cliches are cliches for a reason -- you get what you pay for. Although this seemed to provide the same level of moisturizing as the other, the smell* was just something I cannot get past. I used it a few times and then gave up. If you are sensitive to smells, do not waste your money.*Hard to describe. Sort of floral but not really. Just...off.",2
"Left my shoulder-length, thin and somewhat oily hair brittle.  Did not help with styling and felt Ike I had witch hair after brilliant drying. Air drying made it worse. This was a disappointment as I use Aveeno shampoo and conditioner and body products.",1
"This curling iron heats up so fast.You can adjust the heat settings manually to your preference, as well as that it heats up to 450 degrees.The bad thing:1. It makes your hair smell bad, and also it doesnt create any curls, only gives volume, but then hair goes flat.",2
Lightweight primer lightly masks flaws and evens out some redness. I have sensitive skin and have irritation with some primers but not this one. It also tones down the shine on your face. I put it on after using a high end moisturizer,5
I don't like the way my scalp feels after using this. I prefer the Evercurl conditioning shampoo. So I won't buy this again.,2
I like OPI because it really goes on easy and doesn't make a mess.  It appears to be good quality as it really lasts a long time.  I would definitely buy this product again.,4
"i was looking for a while for a nail polish shelf/rack. and found this one. love that i didnt have to find a place for it. you just hang it on the wall. dont know how many nail polish it fits but i just love this rack. arrived early. nicely packed, new, no scraches.",5
I like this Neutrogena eye cream.  It seems to smooth the skin in the eye area and is gentle.  Works better than more expensive department store brands.,5
"I've tried a lot of perfumes, and it's is the only one I can really call ""my own."" Smells softly fruit with a calming effect. It's now my signature smell and I get comments on it all the time!",5
"I have used expensive facial cleansers, I have used drug store facial cleansers, and never in the past have noticed a difference in my skin, UNTIL I received this product in a kit as a gift. The first few times I used this cleanser, I did notice my skin drying out a bit, but I compensated with the camu camu serum and moisturizer from PTR and not even a week later my skin was back to normal ( wasn't dry, and I no longer had oily spots like I used to get previous to using this). Just so people don't get scared off - my skin was not dry to the point of flaking, just felt much tighter, it was also the middle of winter so it may have played a role. I definitely think this cleanser is worth a try. I loved it so much I ordered a 32oz size from another site and use it as a body wash as well!Also some other things I like, a little bit goes a long way, it removes all of my make up in one shot.",5
"I really like the Clear Scalp line of products as they work well with my long fine colored hair.  This mask was no exception.  It has a pleasant scent and it left my hair very soft and conditioned.  It left my hair with no tangles and easy to comb through.  Also, it did not leave it weighed down as some other intense conditioning products can. This is a great product for your scalp and hair and I plan to continue using this on a weekly basis to improve the health of my colored hair.",5
"I have used L'Oreal products before and I have been very satisfied until I used this.I find the cream to be thick, dry and almost coarse like(Don't know if my tube are old stock). On application I find it too heavy and my skin couldn't breath. I did not my skin look any better or improvement using this product. I personally would not recommend this.",1
I don't know why they call this &#34;Plus Touch of Sun&#34; as I took that to mean it had self-tanner or bronzer in it - but it does nothing really for color. It's not a bad moisturizer at all- I just haven't found the 'touch of sun' in it. This may be because I tan easily and there isn't enough of a &#34;touch of Sun&#34;. In other words I find this no better than other moisturizers which don't promise as much as this one does but I still like it,3
I gave it a five star because I with that Bella would make a cologne that smells like this powder. Its original and last a while. Just a bit on the expensive side but its worth it.,5
"This product is incredibly amazing! I have thick, ""black"" hair type that is always screaming for management. My hair is ALWAYS sucking up moisture which just seems to quickly evaporate from it, for some reason; therefore, it's always SUPER DRY, BRITTLE, BREAKING OFF, CRUNCHY, you name it. I'm surprised I'm not bald, lol. I've been through chemical processing, and colouring on my own because I can't afford the high hairdresser fees (besides I like my own styling, not theirs). Anywhoooo, I invested over $100 recently on equipment and 1 product; that is, a hairdryer kit, electric hot-comb (no more chemical processing for me), silk scarf (used to wrap my hair at night), and one 4-oz bottle of HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner. This was my hair's dream-team, lead by the HSI product. Everything was as normal, using all the equipment BUT when my hair got a hold of the HSI product, it finally surrendered. I'm not kidding! No more crunchiness, no more breaking, no more splitting, no more brittle feel. Instead my hair is soft, and honestly silky (that's where the shock came to me); so, it's very manageable and happy. My plan is to keep my hair healthy, grow it out, do NOT process it chemically (instead I will use by hot-iron-comb to press out my roots), and continue using my (very old) tiny flat iron (for styling). Under that budget, that's my solution. Use HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner, and your hair will behave!",5
"I ordered TRESEMME RENEWAL HAIR AND SCAPL SHAMPOO. 25 OUNCE in hope that it&#8217;s claim to repair hair, rang true. After a handful of uses, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve noticed a huge difference. To be fair, in time that may change. What I can say is it leaves your hair feeling clean, silky, and manageable. I had noticed with another shampoo I was recently using, my scalp tended to itch. Since using TRESEMME RENEWAL HAIR AND SCAPL SHAMPOO, it no longer does. It comes in a good size bottle, that&#8217;s easy to use.

"I'm rarely brand loyal, but I refuse to use any soap but Dove.  The others all dry out my skin, and I just love the way Dove feels.  This particular scent, cool moisture is the one that my husband will use without complaining that it makes him smell like a girl!  This way we only need one bar.",5
"Love this product. Very nourishing and lasts a very long time. It costs much more than cheap drugstore brands, but is a good bargain in the end because you need so little of it to make your hair soft and shiny. Works well with curly hair!",5
Glides on to the lips well.Great pigmentation and colour.Long lasting as it stains slightly.Recommend this colour. Does not need a lipstick under it.,4
Great airflow means this works well in drying your hair and it has adjustable speeds which is a plus. As other reviewers have mentioned this feels heavy. I'm not sure if this means it will last longer or not but it's a factor to consider. The grip feels good and I have no complaints except for the weight.,3
"I absolutely love quality of Shany products... beautiful array of eyeshadow colors strongly pigmented; my only problem is I ordered several of these palettes in one purchase (to give them as gifts for some of my friends) and one of them came without lipsticks and concealers tray... on the other hand, looking at all 4 I bought, I can see they all came with completely different assortment of colors... not only eyeshadows but blushes too. It's a shame because quality is really awesome! I strongly recommend these products, I would just ask SHANY to take more care when packing them to keep standards and comply with description and photos published",5
I'm in love with this polish! It arrived shortly after I ordered it. The glitter is so pretty with other polishes and on bare nails with a clear base coat. Although this polish dried out quickly but I discovered how to make it last longer. I put a little bit of non aceton nail polish remover into the bottle and mixed it around until the glitter come off of the sides of the bottle.,4
I take it and it works really well. It's great that it has 3 in one because that's what I was looking for.,5
"I just love this. It is easier to use then the oil itself. It is a solid yet turns to oil like texture once applied.  I use it for  injuries, mite bites and repellant, I use it on my dogs as well for bites and repellant. I use this on my lips and nose. Feels good.  It is great stuff at super price with this company. I have seen it pried much higher. After my first order I immediately ordered more. Same with the cleansing pads.  I also ordered the chapstick. It seems  a lot like this product only in stick form.",5
"I have used the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner before, and it is still the most awesome product I have ever used on my hair. When I cleanse my hair, I can feel the product stimulating, and increasing blood circulation of my scalp, as I feel the tingling action of the Sweet Almond Mint....It feels like my scalp has just had a  breath mint; its very soothing, and the longer I leave it in my hair, the better it conditions my hair, and hydrates my scalp.",5
"My name is Jarucia and I'm a sunscreen-aholic.Admittedly I'm not as pale as the fresh driven snow, but my skin is still as light as a white flesh nectarine.More than 10 minutes in the sun and I feel as if I'm roasting.  All that sunscreens do for me is ensure that I don't burn.As a purveyor of all things SPF over 25 AND organic, I can't say I'd turn my nose up to Cotz.  It rubs on smooth (though don't be too liberal), I like the tint (which stayed put on me), and left my skin feel comfortably cool the direct sunlight (which is always an added treat).  I left some skin uncoated next to the Cotz coated skin and it was roasting.I live in the PNW so the weather isn't muggy enough to interfere with absorption and drying, but in all fairness few if any sunscreens I've used in muggy climates ever get past being sticky.As an alternative to many mainstream commercial brands, I liked the ingredient list for Cotz but wasn't crazy about it.  This point is simply a personal choice for the skin guardian in each of us.Also, as with most general sunscreens, I did not and would not apply this to my face.  Face specific lotions should be used for that.Overall, I liked this product and feel it delivers as promises.  It is a tad on the pricey side, but with the way it spreads a little does go a long way.",4
"I received this lotion as a gift and I love the fact that it's full of real, non-synthetic ingredients. However, it's sweet smell is more like candy or Bavarian creme than coconut. But, who knows? Maybe that's just because I'm used to fake coconut smells. It does a pretty nice job keeping my skin soft and doesn't leave a greasy residue.",4
"I tried this and it left my hair feeling soft.  I used it with the corresponding conditionerSuave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner, 22.5 Ounce. They work really well together. They also have a light scent and pleasant. If you  are looking for something that will not leave a overwhelming scent, this is nice. It is everything I have come to expect from Suave.",4
I'm not a makeup artist. A professional makeup artist might want more expensive brushes.  But I do use these every day and they have held up well.  I've washed them with 90% alcohol (as some makeup artists have suggested) and they've kept their shape and haven't shed yet.,5
Love this. I bought this product last year and I still have some left. It keeps my hair and skin soft.,4
"I've tried all the &#34;heavy duty&#34; lotions out there to combat my dry winter skin (Eucerin, Aquaphor, etc.), and this is far and away my favorite.  It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  I am noticeably less itchy and flaky after a couple of uses.  Great buy!",5
"I'm using this on adult eczema, not baby eczema, but it it seems to be just as effective.  It soothes the skin almost immediately, and it does not leave behind an oily residue.I have found that only a small amount spreads well over a fairly large patch of skin, so I will not go through the tube as quickly as I initially thought.",4
"This product is my favorite conditioner. I have 4c relaxed hair, relaxed means broken bonds, and I'm African American, so I need tons of moisture. This product does both of those in one bottle. I use this as a deep conditioner almost every wash day. It has a great balance of protein and moisture that does not turn my hair into a brittle or gummy mess. I use this when I am feeling fairly balanced, or leaning on the low-moisture side. This does have protein in it, but when I was starting my hair journey a few years back, I managed to over-condition my hair with this, meaning the moisture levels are much higher. Not to mention my low porosity hair, which needs a very specific level of protein to not feel brittle and dry.The reason I rated four is because recently I used this to DC after a deep protein treatment with ORS Mayo, and it did not help restore the moisture levels of my hair and balance the protein in the Mayo. The only reason I feel this is a problem is because they are from the same line and theoretically should work together. As I am a hair-journeying near product-junky sort of gal, I did use the products as directed, and they did not balance each other out in the way I would expect products from the same line to balance each other out. At any rate, do not use this to balance out moisture when you have entirely too much protein.Alone, though, this product is the best conditioner I have ever used, *hands down*, as of the time of this writing. If I could give it 4.6 or 4.9, I would.",4
"If you're looking for that beach hair look, then buy this. It does not curl your hair but rather makes it wavy. I got a lot of compliments. It's easy to use and heats up quickly.",5
I love bh cosmetics! This is yet another great product- color saturation is intense but easily blendable. I would definitely but this again.,5
"Great product but the packaging is definitely an issue.  The feedback on the pump device is so uniformly bad I wonder why the company continues to deliver a great skin treatment this way - when I buy it now, I just go ahead and remove the lid with a screwdriver and pliers, saving the insert portion to use as a cap.  A tiny dab is plenty and I find it lasts quite a long time, and gives me excellent smoothness and a &#34;cashmere&#34; finish to my skin before applying powder.",4
"This is the &#34;Nourish&#34; half of Tony & Guy's hair products, the conditioner; the first being the shampoo, &#34;Cleanse.&#34; Same marvelous cinnamon notes, which I find to cater to a masculine sensibility (but that is just my opinion), same excellent, rich, decadence profile as The shampoo, that is the hallmark of premiere hair products.",5
My daughter wanted a set of neutral colored eye shadows and this set was well-priced.  The colors are nice and seem to be good quality.,4
When my favorite color for years was discontinued (don't you just hate that?) I turned to this one and just love it!  There is a perfect amount of &#34;pearl&#34; so your lips don't look flat and dry.  The consistence is nice and smooth.,5
I've been using this mascara for years.  I usually get the &#34;very black&#34; or &#34;blackest black.&#34;  But this time I purchased it off Amazon and they had the &#34;carbon black&#34; available.  I think I actually like it better than the other ones.  I like this brand because you don't need to use a lot to get a lot of volume.  I like the non-waterproof kind too because it stays on all day and washes off easily.,5
"This works better than the covergirl simply ageless. It moisturizes and actually make my skin look younger, the light has a subtle color that is nice. It doesn't cover imperfections very well so I do have to use the covergirl with a small brush to cover some blemishes. This gives a nice even coverage and doesn't make your skin look old. I don't know how well this will work in the summer because stuff just melts or sweats off me in the summer but for the winter this is great.",4
"Spray & Go helps make moisturinzing easy and quick. No more waiting for lotion to absorb or getting clothes greasy. The lotion comes out in a fine mist that is lightly moisturizes and absorbs quickly. It isn't greasy or sticky, allowing for getting dressed quickly after use.At first it can have some overspray and seem a little messy. After a little practice, though, it is quite easy and simple. Make sure the area is clear of clothing and don't hold the can too far away.It left my skin light and silky. On days that I go to work I wear compression stockings that put on after bathing.With Spray and Go I don't have to wait to get dressed. Normally I have to wait about 20 minutes before I can put get dressed because I have to wait for my other lotion to absorb and get less oily. It does smell really good, and it is simple to use.It does give skin moisture and hydration, but if your skin is very dry and needs more moisturizing it could leave you wanting. It does lack thicker emollients. As I gear up for warmer weather, it will be useful because I normally lighten my moisturizing routine in the summer months.Disclaimer - I did receive a complimentary Vaseline Spray & Go from Influenster.com and am entring a brand challenge for a chance to win a prize.",5
This conditioner makes my hair so soft and manageable.  I can't even begin to think I will ever use anything else! I have used this product for over a year now and Amazon has the cheapest price and I usually get it within 5 working days which is awesome!,5
I own alot of sigma make up brushes and Its not really common to see a brush like this in other brush company lines. So I had to get this.lets talk about the productthe brush it self has a very thick handle super durable you can even stand it up because of the flat bottom the farrel of the brush is nice i do not see it ever coming off the handle its well made and the bristle are so soft they are synthetic and they are very densely packed not a flimsy brush at allI basically use this brush when  I want to wear powder foundation it provides me with a good medium to full coverage when using this brush the denseness of the bristles help blend and even everything out also i use it for touch ups on days im wearing powder it gets rid of my shine of my t zone using a good touch up powder like i said blends everything effortlessly.Also I will compare this brush with the tarte cosmetics brush  [...] exactly the same thing for the fraction of the cost and eco tools brush works great with liquid foundation just like tartesif you have any questions please comment or like this comment,5
"I'm rather disappointed given, after using the same brand of oil control wash, I assumed this would also provide oil control WHILE ALSO protecting me from the sun's rays. So far the sunscreen aspect seems fine - though it's just a bunch of chemical blockers instead of physical ones like zinc or titanium oxide. Which you could pay half as much for nearly twice the amount of ounces you get in this. Additionally, the aforementioned physical blockers are ""better"" suited for sensitive and acne prone skin - just FYI.I specifically got this moisturizer for the oil control/acne aspect. I've battled acne prone, sensitive, photosensitive, oily skin for over 20 years now. I'm beyond sick and tired of the lip service and promises companies make, using the same ingredients other products use and slap a heavier price tag on it because it's meant for acne prone people like me. Which, if it worked, I guess would be tolerable, but it doesn't.Everything I use is oil free, oil control, etc. I decided to incorporate this in some vain hope it would tackle my oiliness. Nope. Zit (I mean zip). Within an hour of application I'm just as oily as if I'd not put anything on at all or put on a regular sunscreen. If you want an overpriced sunscreen made with chemical blockers be my guest. I could have seen passed it had it done something about the oil. It didn't.Don't market it as an oil control when it doesn't even begin to address it. The oil control wash they make seems to work great. The follow up lotion (which is more expensive) leaves much to be desired.In short, when I purchased this I wasted nearly $16 on greasy sunscreen, which is essentially what this product is.",1
"I've been using Maybeline mascara for more than 50 years.  It was the brand my Mom used and it was the mascara I first learned to use as a teen.  Over the years I've tried other brands, but I always come back to this old dependable product.",5
I use other products and this is a must have in my arsenal now! I use it on my daughters hair as well ~ we are both loving it and so is our hair~!,5
"very nice product! work well, taking off yellow tone from hair. nice gloss.good for blond and other colors(its just going to work like clear )",5
"The price is fair. I also said the quality should be good, because I have not used this product but will soon. When I actually use it, I will update the review.",5
"Maybe it was just the way my nose is shaped, I don't know but this was the experience I had.  Not worth the cost of returning though.",1
The creme is very light.  Goes on easily.  I use it when I walk.  My arms are not suppose to be in the sun.  Neutrogena Ultra Sheer does a great job in protecting them,5
"We are new to micro needling and frankly, my wife thought it was a gimmick at first.  However, after a few weeks of use, she (we) is convinced it works.  In fact, we were intrigued by the product and conducted some research.  Based on what we found, there is little dispute that micro needling works to varying degrees based on the individual and application.The Derma Roller arrived packaged very well with great instructions.  The company provides great support for this product. You can store the roller with the provided cap or, in our case, we store it in the long hard plastic case it arrived in. The roller itself is built very well with high quality materials. The design of the roller made it very easy for everyone in our house to use (you can share the Derman Roller with proper sanitization). What I also like i sthat replacement heads are easily available and only for $10.  As a side note, if you are new to micro needling, I recommend you start with the 0.5mm and then progress as needed.Usability is fantastic. The roller is very easy to use.  First time users will likely experience slight irritation. If you are allowing a child to use (for example, to increase absorption of acne medication), I recommend parental supervision.  My recommendation is not for safety concerns, but for proper use.  My wife noticed an immediate improvement in the absorption of topical skin applications when the Derma Roller is used first (for about 2 minutes).  Our teenage daughter used the derma roller prior to applying acne medication.  After twelve or so applications, she believes she responds better to the acne medication when using the Derma Roller compared to when she does not use the roller. In my case, I noticed slight improvement to some minor scarring near on my hand (I used a specific scar for my testing in addition to my face).  By no means does it make the scar go away.  However,  it seems to reduce the scar visibility to some degree. As a male, what I found intriguing is that using the Derma Roller, I have less ingrown hairs on my face than I normally have (I am a frequent shaver).  For me, this has been the greatest benefit whereas for my girls, absorption of topical applications is their greatest benefit.Though I received a sample for testing and an honest review, I think we will be using this in our household regularly.  Definitely the girls will.",5
"It's lovely! I have a ruddy skin tone (pale as paper, but with some redness and blotchy patches from eczema) and have a hard time finding the right colors to flatter my complexion. Didn't realize from the pic, but the color has an opal/pearl shimmer to it. At first, I admit I thought would be a little too juvenile. But after 2 coats and a top coat of Seche Vite, you can hardly see the pearly look. It just looks like a pretty pinky/purple kind of color. Hard to put into words, but I love it! Shipping was quick and I like that they wrapped it in bubble paper to protect it during shipping!",5
I love this product! I have purchased all the neccessary tools to do my own home shellac mani's. It is SUPER easy to do and I love that I can change my color more often. It paid for itself for the price of 3 salon manicures!,5
"Not a miracle worker but if People did more exercise, sleep and eat healthy than this would probably be a miracle worker. But everything has to have its efforts. Its a Great Product overall.",5
I love this lip liner! It is soooo much nicer than I could have imagined. I normally buy Revlon lip liners but this has made me only want to buy these NYX lip liner. This is cheaper than the Revlon lip liner too.,5
I am so impressed on how quick my package shipped.I love ordering from amazon.I received my package and when I opened my Beauty Blender I loved how cute and small it is.Cant wait to try and see how flawless it makes my makeup look.,4
"It really does do the closest job of approximating the hair I get when I'm a humid ocean environment. My only complaint is that I can be a little TOO sticky and a little TOO stiff/crunchy, but I'm playing with it to figure out if I use less if I can get the right effect.",4
"It is creamy, not greasy and is easy to wash off, but it doesn't really feel as if it has much ability to scrub my face.  I'll have to use it longer to see how it works.  I'm used to having rough granuals to scrub my face, but maybe it's a good thing not to have so many.",4
"One of the five came apart the first time I used it, but a little glue fixed that. The dotting tools are better than using a toothpick or bobby pin.",4
"I use the 60sec timer for base, and 90 seconds for all color, and 180 seconds for the final top coat. Rub with alcohol in the end... and I have NEVER witnessed any problems with this product. In addition, when I received this product my puppy pulled the cord and knocked it off my 2 foot table. IT DID NOT BREAK. haha. that was a good sign that this is a sturdy product, depsite it's light weight.UPDATE - 8 uses later, the lights are loosing strength. I am needing to use the 90 second timer for all coats. It still works, the lights are just loosing the juice they once had.",5
"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.This is the best shampoo I've ever used for my hair type. I have an oily scalp and normal hair, and this is able to thoroughly remove the excess oil on my scalp without completely stripping my hair. I need only a light, leave-in conditioner and my hair is perfect afterwards. Unfortunately, the official, retail cost of this shampoo is high (~$23 for 8 ounces, though it can be found cheaper on Amazon) and it's just not in our budget to pay that much for this shampoo that often. So instead I use it 2 or 3 times a week, alternating it with other types of shampoo, both moisturizing and clarifying and I'm able to still reap the benefits of this shampoo without completely breaking us. But I can recommend this as a once/week clarifying for dryer hair/scalp and, if you can afford it, for use as frequently as you like for oilier hair/scalp.",5
"I want to first thank everyone who gave such amazing reviews, it helped me pick the right product so thank you. I thought I'd review this as easily as possible for those who were like me, trying to find a simple direction for longer lashes.Application is as follows: Mascara. Divaderme. Mascara.Make sure mascara is wet, I only did one eye at a time to ensure this, then apply divaderme, then mascara again. Oh and apply to tips from middle of lashes to outer lashes and it looks more real. Good luck! It's really easy and you shouldn't get the flakes or fibers on your face if you just tap a few times before application.",5
"this can definitely aid in correcting an ingrown problem once you learn how to use it,it does have fairly aggressive teeth but that is to remove nail quicker for what you need to get done,all in all this was a good choice for the problem it was designed for and like I mentioned once you figure out the best way to use it,What i did was kind of chip away at it instead of trying to do the regular filing motion with short little pressure motions I hope this helps ingrown nails can be terribly painful to deal with",5
"I love Remington'sT-StudioandFastFinishblow dryers; they both surpass the inexpensive dryers I'd previously used all my life. This model, though, is just okay ... it's comparable to all those previous dryers.It's the standard professional shape (not collapsible), the standard 1875 watts, with airflow options of low and high, and heat options of cool, warm, and hot (plus a button for a burst of cold). An airflow concentrator attachment is enclosed and a diffuser is available (at no charge) through the company's website. (FYI: the nozzles of this model and the T-Studio are the same size and the attachments fit both; the nozzle of the FastFinish model is larger.) The box touts ""Keratin Therapy"" (a keratin-infused ring around the dryer nozzle) as giving ""healthier, stronger hair,"" but I doubt the claim and have noticed no such effect.The dryer's case is a beautiful pearlescent, light rose-tan color (not the gray shown in the product image above), and the switches are extremely easy-to-use toggles (rather than the hard-to-move sliders e.g. on the FastFinish). The airflow is strong and there's plenty of heat. But the case material is inexpensive plastic, the motor seems lightweight, and the unit is very noisy.My recommendations:For adults, try theT-Studio dryer-- it's visually beautiful, with strong airflow and plenty of heat while being the quietest dryer I've ever used.For use on children, try theFastFinish-- a fuller, blowsy airflow with very-warm (rather than hot-hot) temperature.",3
"I really like most Suave products but this one is just okay. My hair is fine and on the dry side lately. This works fine as a shampoo. The fragrance is more sweet almond than verbena, but it's pleasant enough and produces a good lather. But after rinsing and toweling my hair, it was impossibly tangled and I had to use a leave-in conditioner to comb it through. So I'll use this product as a shampoo along with a conditioner like Suave Moroccan Infusion but I won't use it as a 2 in 1. Actually, I have yet to meet a 2 in 1 product that actually works both as a shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair comb-able without weighing it down.",4
I am big on eye creams. This is not fancy---it won't diminish wrinkles or drastically reduce bags BUT it is pleasantly refreshing and extremely hydrating. I plan to keep it stocked in my cabinet as a safe go-to product. Give it a try.,5
"Love the retinol, 2% , well I had no problem with sensitivity. I love the whole packaging, very high end and the product seems to do what it says. and no high end brand names to be bought,what's not to love about supporting a small business and getting a great American product?",4
"This hairdryer is great. It's light and easily transportable and tucks away without taking up too much space. The settings and design are simple but not cheap. It is worth every penny! I first purchased 1 for myself and then I got another for my sisters. My mother wants me to get her one too, so I will be purchasing a 3rd sometime in the future.",5
"After using a variety of pretty course exfoliating scrubs for a few years, I backed away and started mixing a powder exfoliator with cleanser to slough off dead skin cells without making my face feel raw (except when I go for a peel). I was interested in trying this Simple facial scrub because I felt like maybe a more basic product could also be gentle and effective.I was right about that aspect of the scrub. Since I don't have a powder that needs protected from water, I can actually use this scrub in the shower and get the same benefits without spending time over the sink with my homemade concoction. I will save it for removing make-up now and rely on this for my every-few-days exfoliating routine.It features a very nice ration of exfoliating material to cleanser and left my face feeling smooth and clean without any tingling or burning sensation - a definite plus.",5
It's nice to be able to get your hair dry and straight in one shot but be aware of steam burns.  I am sure this goes without actually saying but I am saying it anyway.The directions say to make sure vents are away from scalp but I still found that some steam escaped the sides too.I found if I started a couple inches away from scalp for the first pass through then go closer to scalp that helps with too much steam by your scalp.The directions are missing a line too. They state under wet/dry setting &#34;when light is amber it is safe to use on dry hair. It is safe to use on wet hair&#34;.  I am guessing they meant to say when theight is green?  That is the only other color it went to.I have pretty curly hair and this straightener was able to get it pretty straight. I would not call it salon straight and shiny. I did not feel that this iron clamped down hard enough on the hair. It was too easy to pull through compared to my other straight irons.,3
"This oil is pure Christmas tree! We haven't gotten our tree yet, but if you came for a visit today, you would be looking for one! The next best thing to the real thing. Now, I can get a little Christmas fix year round! Love it and will purchase again.",5
"It is good for me! anyone buy it need to use it exactly following the instruction, or you will waste it. It really good for deep clean. I recommend to use it one-two times per week, not everyday.",5
I was disappointed in the product itself because it did not come with any directions. I was left to figure out how to use each product on my own.,3
"We bought two of these hairdryers for our kids because our regular hairdryer is a bit too bulky and heavy for them. Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly. It's also very lightweight, which makes it great for travel. Lightweight, plenty of power, easy to hold. All in all, a good value for the money.",5
"I was so excited for this to come. and when i got it, i opened it up and put batteries in and it did not work. i tried all different types of brand new batteries. and it still didnt work. it was broken.",1
"I mean, like all of Axe's body washes, it does the job of getting your body nice and clean. But this &#34;Harmony&#34; fragrance is something else.. and it's not goodThe scent is like a a combination of citrus and vick's vapor rub. one minute, it's fruity, the next, it's menthol-ish.And not only that, it's too strong. When I wash my chest and neck, I can feel my eyes burn a little from the heavy fragrance.Sorry, Axe really messed up here with this scent. I do not recommend",1
"This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay's Naked 1 & 2 palettes. There are three colors that it doesn't dupe, but for the money, it's a fantastic buy!",5
"Keeping it simple: great scent, bubbly, creamy, rinses well, soft hair, defined curls, color safe. Awesome. Bought this at the store but will order from here if I need add on or a giant bottle. Other great suaves are damage care, color care and sleek shampoo. They all smell like a spa day.",5
The color is a great color since it is a now color and definitely is liked by young and old.,5
"I love these rhinestones !!! They are exactly what I ordered, exactly what the seller said they would be. I was a little disappoiunted because I wouldve liked them all to be different sizes, but that wasnt described as one of the specifications, so i am not complaining. I will just have to buy more, which is not a problem because I love these things !!! :-))",4
"This moisturizer works wonderfully. I love it! It has a light fragrance that is not overpowering, and it does not feel greasy when you use it. It works well with my foundation, and I have noticed that my face looks softer than it used to with the other moisturizer that I used to use. I will continue to use this product!",5
"this color is great and loreal is a great quality brand of polish for such an amazing price. it came very quickly in the mail, will beordering form them again",4
"It's got all the minerals and nutrients that hair needs. It smells amazing, in a non-artificial way, and not too overpowering either. Best of all, it cleans/lathers super well and really does volumize hair. Highly recommend it!",5
"I have a bottle of this and its really fun, its a great color for spring or summer and its a decent price. I almost only use professional brands and China Glaze is one of my favorite brands- theres only a few of there colors that I don't like because some don't stay on as well as others. I get lots of compliments on this color and its good nail polish.",5
"I can not talk highly enough about this top coat. It is amazing. It keeps my polish on longer, stronger and more vibrant than any other top coat I've ever used. Would highly highly recommend this product if you are one for top coats. Nobody enjoys painting their nails and a day later seeing chipping or peeling. This top coat keeps just that from happening.",5
These work pretty nicely. You just dip the ends in nail polish and then dott your nails. I made my toe nails ladybug colors:),5
I love this product. This is my second one. My first one was so old i burned it out. I'll keep using this product. Just love it.,4
this wig looks very pretty. color is nice. feels good. takes some adjusting. the wig is large. and adjusting it in the bag..only makes it look bulky. it looks like there is a lump in bag of my head because of it. the biggest problem aside from that...is that its too flippy. I got this because I like how it shows the gradual bob. with the way its so flippy...you cant really see that. it just looks like a straight bob. it gets to bulky. I wanted a sleek and sharp edged cut like in the pic.,3
"I've always struggled with cellulite, even though I exercise (weight training and cardio) five or six days a week and eat really healthfully.  I've noticed, however, that since turning 38 last year, my cellulite has gotten worse, so I'm trying to do something more aggressive about it.  I started using this 10 days ago, and so far I have noticed maybe only a *slight* reduction in the appearance of my cellulite.  It's just as visible as it has been on the backs of my thighs, although I do have to push harder on the front of my legs to see it.  For now, I'm giving this two stars since I was hoping that the appearance of my cellulite would be much less than it is after using it for 10 days, which is when the product description says you will notice improvements.  (I will also  be sure to update my review after using this for a few more weeks to see if there is any positive changes.)In addition to using this once a day (at night, so I don't have to worry about the stickiness on my clothes, just my pajamas), I've also been massaging my thighs in the shower with a cellulite massager like this Bliss oneBliss Slimulator 1 eathat I picked up from the Body Shop a few years ago.  Hopefully the combination of the two will help as I use them for a few more weeks.In the past, I had tried the regular Nivea cellulite cream (Nivea Good-Bye Cellulite Gel-Cream, 6.7 oz (189 g) (Pack of 2)), but I got lazy about using it since it's super sticky (much stickier than this serum), and you have to use it twice a day to see results.  The directions for this serum say that you only need to use it once a day, which I've been doing, but maybe I will bump it up to twice a day.Since I've ready that these creams only work as long as you keep using them and that your cellulite will return once you stop using them, I also decided to pick upThe Cellulite Solution: A Doctor's Program for Losing Lumps, Bumps, Dimples, and Stretch Marks, which offers suggestions on how to make your skin stronger, so that the cellulite doesn't poke through the top layers. I will write a review for Dr. Murad's book once I've integrated his recommendations for six weeks.  In the meantime, this Nivea serum doesn't seem to be making a noticeable difference, but I will be sure to keep using it and will note any changes I see.",2
It does not go on very thick and it does not stay. It is kind of a waxy texture and I was disappointed in the lipstick.,2
"So far I am really enjoying using this 20  0/0 - Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid serum by Salvere in the warm/hot weather. I keep it in the refrigerator and apply it to my freshly washed face morning and evening. It goes on nice and smooth, as well as cool and fresh. I also use the serum on my hands. I am new to this product so I'am looking foward to noticing a decrease in some fine  lines and wrinkles. this is a great product for me. I don't like heavy creams, so this is perfect for me. I even put the serum under my eyes and under my brow bone. I love it there are some great organic/natural broad spectrum sunscreens out there. Thanks courtesy of salsol ..",5
I have been using this product for a year was very excited to receive this product the price is perfecct!!.it seems however my package was stolen as I have not received it even though it says delivered -__-.  Amazon was great very apologetic and refunded my money no hassle.I am looking to order this again and have my package held at the warehouse so I might actually receive it this time.,5
"Love this colour.  Currently have this colour on and wears very well and the red is deep, rich. I get a lot of compliments on them.",5
came on time. for the price it is bad quality in the way it is made. This mascara does work well in giving the appearance of doll like lashes doesnt really give much volume. I would and wouldnt recommand this to a friend simply because it does half of what it is advertised to do.,4
"There are pros and cons to everything, and the same is true of the dry shampoo. Yes, the powder can feel thick once you've spread it on, and yes, it sometimes lightens/grays my hair color, but the oily look is gone, and there's such amazing volume for 2nd and even 3rd day hair!I FAR prefer this dry shampoo to any of the spray dry shampoos, cause then the powder dries out your hair with the alcohol, and definitely leaves a dusty residue look. This dry shampoo is very easy to apply right where you need it, and just as much as you actually need, so that's very effective and nice. And seriously, the volume it gives my limp day-old hair is awesome. It's quick and easy, and it doesn't add static to my hair, which my other  favorite non-spray dry shampoo unfortunately definitely does.blow Pro Faux Dry Shampoo with Pure Protein Blend, 1.7 OunceI'm definitely keeping this is rotation, and really, the only reason it isn't my perfect utmost favorite is because I can definitely feel the powder on my head, and it's a little bit of an itchy feeling in the spots where too much powder was applied. But it looks great, and you know we ladies will suffer quite a bit for beauty, so, yeah, I deal with those bummers since it's such a time-saver.",5
"I love this stuff so far, i am an African American woman who has been growing her hair out for years using weaves. And for the past 4, 5 years i have been successful in achieving length ..so far about 16, 17 inches worth. Anyhow this is the first year i decided to wear human hair instead of the cheap synthetic ones. Since April this year the hair was doing fine than!! it started getting so tangled and dried out.. i had no clue had to manage it; than i used QP Elasta from sally's ..good but is expensive this stuff i found at the dollar store, yes the dollar store!! did way better of a job at detangling. I got out the shower ran my fingers through the hair i was sure was still tangled.. but no.. like butter it had so much slip!!! I wish i would had used this stuff in the beginning. the reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars was it didnt leave a shine like my v05 but my v05 doesn't detangle like suave either.",4
"I've used this body wash in the past but where i live now doesn't carry it, hence ordering it through Amazon. It exfoliates pretty well, and isn't scented which I definately prefer. It also suds up nice on a loofah. This particular seller also did a great job shipping it out fast and in good condition.",4
"Sad to say when i got my package i was warned about the mess i was getting into from the company, it wasn't to bad though i mean glitter does that it gets on everything, except there were a few double colors, all in all with the glitter mistake on the plastic and the product being really smaller than pictured i would have to say for 30 pigment powders i am impressed the pigment in them is simply perfect for blending, yes they had a mistake but definitely am going to buy more from them and this time i hope the packager they had doesn't get the glitter all over, these are indeed sample sizes so if your looking for a color to try and don't know which one to get this is worth the money",4
"You cannot go wrong with this set of brushes. They are excellent quality for the price. I bought the set for my daughter for Christmas and I was really impressed. Definitely recommended. I have an e.l.f. concealer brush that I have been using for the past 2 years, so I knew that one was good, but was curious about the quality of the rest of them. They really are great. They aren't cheap feeling, like dollar tree quality, but they carry the same price. It is an amazing deal!This set came with each brush in it own individual packaging (just like if you would buy them separate at the store) inside a plastic bag - like a ziploc bag type.I am very pleased with the purchase and my daughter was thrilled to have such a nice variety.",5
"I give this spray only 4 stars because it can dull the shine, but it is wonderful for volumizing on dried hair that's been styled. Don't touch the hair right after spraying. It's better to shake your head or spray it while bent over, and just start with adding a little at a time to the body of the hair, and less on the crown because it can be very sticky.",4
I rate this product 'Maybelline New York Mineral Powder Bronzer...' 3 stars because the product turns out way smaller than I expect from the picture. Pro: The only thing I like about this product is the cuteness in size & it came with a brush. Con: the powder kind of irrate my skin. It was hard trying to get the powder out of the container with only 5 small holes. The brush could easily get damage because theres no place to store since it couldn't fit in the container. & The shipping took about 3-4 days.,3
I recieved this item and it was very well packaged.  Beautiful and richly pigmented colors. Please be aware that the containers are very very small and would require you to mix the pigments with acrylic powder in order to properly adhere it to the nail.  Believe me a little can go a long way.  For every container of the colored pigments I mixed it with three quarter teaspoons of clear acrylic powder and an eighth teaspoon of white acrylic powder.  You can even mix a little glitter in them to make them simmer.  Nice product.,4
"A derma roller is a roller with many micro needles attached.  This particular product has 540 micro needles on it.  The needles will irritate the skin just enough so that it tricks the skin into rejuvenating itself. What I can tell you is that it does NOT hurt at all.I have used derma rollers in the past with successful results. This one has the 1.00mm needles, I can not imagine anything less than .5mm working but I guess it can.Yes, the product does come with instructions.  It also comes with a clear travel case to house the product in.The main thing is to keep your face clean and the device sterilized.  You will not see results overnight but the product will work.  I would recommend trying it on an unseen area of your body, to see how it works for you, before going directly to your face.",5
"This is the only lip product that I had ever finished in my life! says a lot!! This lip butter has beautiful color payoff, feels like &#34;butter&#34; on the lips and is so comfortable to wear!! I love this Revlon lip butter line!!",5
"Every once in a while it seems like my shampoo starts to bog down:  The strands hang in my face, the hair feels heavy, and takes on an almost greasy look.  No matter what shampoo I switched to--no matter how ""light"" or ""pure"" the shampoo claimed to be, I couldn't get rid of the heavy and greasy feeling.Until my eye caught this product sitting on the store shelf.  The clearness and clarity of the product called to me first (after all I was looking for something ""pure"" and ""light"").  Then the name brand spoke volumes, as I have always respected, trusted and gotten great results from Neutrogena products (I just have trouble spelling it...).  Then I read the words ""Anti-Residue"" and you wouldn't believe how quickly I scarfed up that box.  (The security man behind the cameras must have gone on alert...).I use this once a month now, (once a week is the suggested frequency in the instructions), then go back to whatever shampoo I had been using--and my problem was solved.One thought that might help you decide whether this product is for you or not:  It was a question that I had about the product before it actually hit the counter in the check-out lane:  If I use this and don't follow up with conditioner, will I be able to untangle my hair easily?  If I have to follow it up with conditioner, will I negate the ""good"" that I've just done in using the shampoo?  I found that after using this product, my brush went through my hair easier than when I use a ""2-in-1"" shampoo.  So, in my case, I didn't need a conditioner immediately after using it.  I went back to a conditioner the next day.",5
"Fast shipment and a beyond amazing product: perfect shade of red, highly pigmented, easy application, dries on matte without drying out lips, long lasting, and adorable packaging! Honestly, it's red velvet magic! Buying any other product for red lips would be a mistake.",5
so far so good. i use it everytime after showering before blow drying and it really helps give me the volume i'm looking for!,5
"The tip is too rounded to make a thin line.Mine arrived without it being inside a cardboard package. It was loose, inside the envelope.When I went to use it, you could see that the tip was damaged, and the &#34;smude part&#34; was alsobent and flopping.Not worth sending it back. I am not buying make-up from anyone that is not AMAZON.Why would anyone take the eyeliner out of its packaging, and send it to you as if it were a #2 pencil?It could be contaminated since it is wide open.My gosh, the things people do to make a quick buck.",2
"Not certain that this night cream is the best out there, but for the price it is certainly a fine option.Having no sensitivity reaction, the cream goes on nicely without a greasy residue.It appears to work in moisturing my face and neck and both skin areas feel firmer.This is a repeat purchase, first time on Amazon, good price and delivery.",4
"I had been using a different brand that comes in a box with the bleach included. I decided to try Manic Panic and I am very pleased. I have been doing my own hair for years and have used many different products, I really enjoy this one.Just some tips:-If you have really dark hair, you need to bleach it first but make sure not to leave the bleach on too long or it will damage your hair and your hair will NOT hold the color.-Use a protein filler (in Red Red, available at Sallys) first. Dampin hair, put on filler, leave on for 20 minutes then put on dye DO NOT WASH OUT FILLER. (This will help your hair grab onto the color better and protect your hair)-When you dye you hair, make sure you get everything and then put a shower cap on.-Apply heat every now and then with a hair dyer.-Leave hair dye in AT LEAST one hour (jar says 30 mins but the longer the better)-Rinse till water is light pink and then use a white (or apple cider) vinegar rinse. (This will help lock in color)-Wash hair and dry normally.Hope this helps!!!!",5
I honestly love them they are soft n very good use I use them like almost everytime I put on makeup n they work perfect with liquid make up. I just love them n the big plus is that they are environment friendly.,5
A drug store dryer works just as well. I am disappointed - greatly - with the lack of performance versus the price.,2
"I was going to go for another brand of facial Vitamin C as well but I sure am glad I decided to order this product.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is tighter, fresher, younger looking, less lined...  Yes.  All that.  And my pores even look smaller.  I will be faithful to this fantastic product now that I've found it.  Not one other product I've used has made such a great change in my skin  :)  I highlly recommend this!",5
"I think this product works really well for what it says it does!Only problem is I stopped using this to use another productbecause my acne started getting better )not sure if it was due to this,most likely this with combo of new face wash)recommended, & love that it doesnt smell too strong, like many other acne meds",5
I've been using this product all week long along with the matching shampoo and conditioner.  I'm really loving how much better my hair is looking and feeling.My Hair- My hair feels so much softer and healthier now. It feels lighter too which is giving it better volume even when I don't use a hair dryer. The Serum is definitely helping to give that salon look.  My hair shines more and it's helping my curls look much better too.Frizz- This Serum is helping my frizz problem.  It's not improved it greatly but it certainly looks better.  The frizz just doesn't look as bad as it did prior to using these products.  If that makes any sense.  I have a bit less frizz than before but not a significant difference.Overall I'm really enjoying using the Keratin Smooth products.  I've noticed a big difference in the overall look and feel of my hair.  I would recommend using these products together.,5
It is good for drying my hair a bit faster but does nothing gor the &#34;French Poodle&#34; look. I still use several products for taming the mane...,3
I'm not pleased with the results I had when I bought this one thinking it would be best for my bi-racial daughter's curly hair.  It just weighed her hair down and didn't hold her curls at all. The Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner did much better with her hair.  One size does not fit all in this case.,2
"at first I thought it would be too difficult for me to use; but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy they were.  And they look great in the hair, nice and secure.",5
This I couldnt even see on my skin (olive toned) no matter how much I applied. I gave it to my kids as play make up. At least it didnt cost that much.,1
"The tip of this pen is perfect for lining as close to your eyelash line as you can possibly get. This adds a dramatic effect to my eyes while at the same time, the thin line is subtle enough that it looks nautral. When I wear this as a thin line along my lash line the eyeliner lasts at least 12 hours, but when I wear it in a thick, winged out cat eye look, it doesn't last long at all. It smudges and fades very quickly. I'm impressed enough with the slim tip of this liner pen that would purchase this again, but only to wear close to my lash line. For cat eyes, I'll have to find a different smudge proof liner with more staying power.",3
Loved this it is great for all over coverage it also allows you to mix a color you want. It is not as thick which is great also because you don't want a cake look. I am a makeup artist and buy a lot of different brands. You should always have different brands of makeup for your clients. E.l.F is a great brand. The other thing is you want something that lasts this product does not leave you needing a touch up huge plus in my book. It also spreads evenly and with ease. Definitely recommend this.,5
"Good quality, nice array of brushes to choose from.Very useful for other art work.  Highly recommend thesebrushes for anyone!",4
"Waaaaay too soft. I can't believe people like this brush, or that they claim it will exfoliate your skin. If they came out with varying degrees of firmness I would give this brand another try.",2
"I purchased this in conjunction with L'Oreal RevitaLift Eye Moisturizer because I have been experiencing baggy tired looking eyes out of no where!!!!  I have bad bad bad allergies, and I realized that I really need to start paying attention to how I handle these allergies to my eyes, lest I end up with these tired looking eyes forever...I use these moisturizing pads every night and the eye makeup comes off immediately, with awesome moisturization along with.  Almay claims to be hypoallergenic, and from the products I have used I would have to say they are telling the truth.  I like also the way it hydrates my eyes all night, with less puffiness in the morning..",5
"I love the product itself, but I did not appreciate the fact that it was open when I received it. It didn't look used although there was no way of telling if it really was used or not. I do not appreciate that being that my family is currently overseas I cant just return items. I will try to avoid this company when purchasing any products. I thought I was paying for a brand new product.",3
This is creamy and I rarely have to use conditioner when a shampoo has the creamy look. So far I haven't used it with this one because it leaves my hair soft and manageable on its own. Better than that is that I feel like I have just walked out of the beauty shop every time I use it. I think they must use it there too!,5
"I always buy it and it is the best one out of many keratin shampoos and conditioners that I bought in the past. The hair is silky, soft. It smells nice. And you can wash your hair as often as you want as it is not harsh at all and doesn't strip it off of natural oils as the other shampoos do.",5
Goods-you get 24 colors!-packed nicely just like in the photos.-pirce for 24 set is awsome.Bad-few colors hardly shows on your nail ex.yellows and lighted one mostly.-the tip is super fine that its kinda hard to use.Overall its preaty good when you are learing to nail art. you get 24 colors for a the price even if the product is a little cheap.,4
"This hair clip is beautiful!!! It waay bigger than I expected.....but then again I didn't read the dimensions. It's 4 inchs!! Good for an updo, and then clip it in the back. Very pretty though!! It was worth the month long wait to arrive from overseas.",5
"This was the first time I've tried Dove shampoo.  While I am familiar with their unique facial soaps I wasn't very aware that they made other products.  Here are a few observations:- It is creamy, however it does not lather as much as other shampoos I have used- The fragrance is very subtle, though pleasant- The sculpted bottle is easy to hold with wet hands- The cap is a little difficult to open and it cracked the first time I used it- It leaves the hair clean with no noticeable residue",4
"This shampoo is by far the best I've ever used. I also have the conditioner (read review.) I have allergies which led me to using baby products which didn't really help my hair. I do not color my hair but I got a color care shampoo because I think it's more gentle than regular shampoos. I feel this is much milder than Pantene as well. I have a lot of wavy/curly fine hair that is hard to style and condition, but this along with the conditioner and fine hair foam I can get my hair to behave quite well. Please buy this and enjoy soft,  clean hair!",5
"i was so shocked when i got this product and used it after i washed my face usually most vitamin C serums leave this sticky film on my face or break me out this one however didn't do either and it made my face glow like i have never seen my skin feels almost like it used to and it is so light not extremely heavy or harsh, another great product from InstaNatural! sample provided for review",5
I didn't think I was going to like this shampoo because I didn't like the Curling Gel Souffle...but to my surprize I love it. My hair smells good and it has a shine to it when I'm washing it. It lathers very well so it only takes a little and my hair feels soft while I'm washing it. Love it!,5
"I had a look at the reviews and decided to try it anyway.  I cant say I'm too thrilled. The spongy bit on the end is great for smudging and to give a smokey effect but I find it smudges to easily and half way through out the day I look like a raccoon! You cant really do 'light' eyeliner using this product, I found it goes on quite thicky.bbI'll still wear mine at night only when I want think black eyes but for everyday use I'll stick to something else.",3
Shampoo works fine.  I found it to be more moisturizing than other shampoos I have used.  The texture is creamy and has floral scent.  Shampoos lathers well. I like the frizz control. My wife and i used this shampoo together.,4
Glitter can give really cool effects to nail designs it just makes a mess when you have the dust raw.,4
I'm using this along with my dermaroller every other day and .... OMG!!!!! the pores on and around my nose got so much smaller! I have no fine lines and pretty much look the same as I used to when I was 19 (but fatter) so I can't tell you that my lines went away. I however did have a very small scar in my eyelid .. never listened to not putting things in my eyelids or under my eyes and I'm glad because I can hardly see the scar now. It wasn't too noticeable unless you would come really close to my eye but now even then ... even w. a magnifying glass I can't see it,5
"There is no need to buy the expensive, department store beauty counter moisturizers for 4 times (or more) the price.  This is the most luscious night moisturizer I've ever tried (and I've tried quite a few).  It feels wonderful, and the effects are immediately noticeable.  After the first night of using it, my skin was noticeably brighter, smoother, and softer.  I hope Olay never changes this formula, because I want to use it for the rest of my life :-)",5
I am absolutely thrilled with this product!  I have heavily processed platinum hair that is occasionally straightened with a CHI straightener.  Marrakesh oil is perfect to use out of the shower to lock in moisture and shine and is great to use as a heat protector before using hot tools.  It has the most incredible scent and makes your hair shinier and healthier.  I used to use CHI Silk Infusion but will only use this for now on.,5
"Applying this product is both  and exasperating and awkward. The paper stencils are flimsy and rip easily. I could have done a better job tracing eyebrows on paper and cutting out along the lines . Unless you are extremely patient, you will be disappointed with this product.",2
"Just purchased it an i've used it three times so far. A i derma-roll my skin, i apply a 20% vitamin C serum and it helps a lot for my acne and acne scars. Face looks much brighter and smoother. I also apply argon oil the next day, makes my skin feel smoother. The acne marks seems to have subsided but let's see how it works in the long run. Would recommend this to people who suffer from scars, acne and dry skin.I have purchased another one for my scalp too. Heard that it rejuvenates falling hair.",5
"This is a great amount of polish at a very reasonable price.  Take note that the brushes are thinner for artwork but I have had no problem painting my nails or my daughters nails with these.  The one drawback is that many of the colors are too light to show up for stamping.  But I have used those as a base coat.  Also some work better if you use a really dark base coat.  You have to play around with them to figure out which colors work best, but for the price this is a great set.  My daughter loves the amount of colors to choose from, and she is only 6.  She now wants to polish her nails more often.  I have also used these to stamp her nails and it worked great.  Over all this is a great set, it only lost one star due to not all of them being perfect for stamping, but I don't think that was the initial intent of this set either.",4
"This is a pretty good product.  I can't swear that it made my lashes grow, but it DOES strengthen them.  It might even make them fuller (I can't judge based on my own eyes and I didn't take photos before starting this product), but I honestly think it strengthens them and makes any product you place on your lashes much more effective.  I will happily repurchase this product.",4
"My mom is a type of person who don't mine going store to store , surfing through the website, and ordering through TV ads to fine the best cream minimizers. She's 56 and is trying to minimize her fine lines and wrinkles. I'm over 35 and have never even touched a wrinkle cream. So I handed this cream to her to fine out what she thinks.  My mom tried Hydroxatone to get rid of her wrinkles and it actually ended up clearing up her dark aging spots after a month, so she recommended that I try it when I feel its ready! Amazing! She's very satisfied with this product so I'll make sure to hold on to this brand. Recommended.",4
"I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly. I love that it's all natural and alcohol-free. The price is affordable and the toner lasts for a few months with constant use. I usually apply the toner to my face, neck, chest and upper back using a cotton swab. I have to say it has also started to help some of blemish marks heal, especially the ones on my face.Other reviewers said that this product helped fight acne when used alone, but I haven't seen that. In fact, I stopped using my usual acne wash and lotion for a month and I broke out severely. This toner reduces the redness and my face doesn't look as blotchy, but alone it did not stop the pimples from forming. Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this toner.It also works well on bruises. Normally, my bruises stay for weeks and slowly make that awful transition from dark blue to green to orange to healed, but with this I've noticed that my bruises heal within days with daily application.I definitely recommend this product to all skin types.",4
Sometimes having and using old-fashioned products are a good thing. In the case of the Conair Compact Hairsetter electric rollers it was not a good idea. The rollers reminded me a lot of my old Clairol hair rollers I used back in college almost 40 years ago. The Conair rollers come with rollers with nubs to help secure the hair to the roller. There are color coded clips used to secure the rollers to the hair. My old Clairol rollers used the same concept except the Clairol hairsetter came with a steam option making it easier to create long lasting curls. The Conair hairsetter did not have that option.I did try this hairsetter and found the curl did not last. Approximately 30 minutes after removing the rollers my hair started to lose volume.I am returning the rollers as they did not meet my expectations.Recommend with caveats given.,3
I love wearing eyelashes for going out/parties/weddings etcOnly one set is actually wearable/natural looking for normal wear (similar to Ardell 110 lashes) the others are more dramatic/costume useThat being said they are very stiff/you need to bend them a bunch before applyingMy only complaint is that unlike ardell/elf/mac etc lashesI can physically feel their presence the entire night on my eyelids and they're a bit irritatingIt's probably because they're made from a sharper plastic type material and not soft like other fake eyelashes I've usedI will still wear them but I will not re-buy,3
"When I ordered these extensions, Amazon said that they wouldn't be here until AFTER Christmas, even as late as mid January. It is the 16th... and they arrived yesterday!As for the extensions themselves, please do not order these thinking these are thick and that you'll have beautiful looking luscious locks. They are only 80 grams of hair so keep in mind IT IS NOT A LOT OF HAIR!!!I bought these because my other extensions were starting to get a little thin from washing and dying. I didn't wanna spend another $100-150 on a new set of extensions so, I thought that getting a cheap set of extensions would allow me to just supplement the thickness a little by using a weft or two from the new set. For $17.00 and free shipping, my extensions will last me a lot longer!The hair is beautiful! Great color. and nice length. Again, they wouldn't work as a set of extensions alone if you are going for length, how ever they are great for adding thickness for already very long hair or a previous set of thin extensions.",5
"They were a bit thinner than I expected but other than that, they worked well and for a good price.",5
"I like Neutrogena in general. I find that their products (for the most part) are pretty easy on my skin and won't break it out.Now, I'm quite fair-skinned, and I want to keep it that way. I burn easily, even in the winter, if it's a clear sunny day. Because of some of the stuff I put on my skin regularly, it is an absolute requirement that I have a good sunscreen on hand to use every single day, or else it'll pretty much negate all my efforts to make my skin look better.So on my search for a good sunscreen, a friend's mom showed me this stuff. I'd been eager to try it out for myself, because I'd heard it works really well and I hate greasiness of regular 'ol sunscren.It certainly doesn't make my skin greasy, but it leaves a bit of shine, like most sunscreens do. When I put it on, I barely know it's there, which is a huge plus! I just get a generous amount and cover any area that'll be exposed to the sun before I start the day.The only drawback to this stuff is that it has a sunscreen-ish smell that I'm not particularly fond of, it's not a reeking, knock-you-out dear god what is that kind of smell, but it is strong enough to where you'll know it's on, and anyone close to you might catch a whiff, too. I'm not going to lie, when I first sniffed it, I was really really hesitant to slather it on...I usually have to spray on some body spray to cover it up, or else people will wonder why my skin smells so weird. After a while, though, maybe half an hour, I notice the smell kind of diminishes, but it's still there if you waft hard enough.All in all, I like this sunscreen. As an avid sunscreen fanatic (for good reasons, of course!) who wears SPF 45 all year round, even in the wintertime, this is honestly one of my favorite products I've found. It's not too expensive, I got it on sale for about $7, and if you use it every day, it should probably last you a few weeks (provided you're putting enough on!)The only drawback is the smell, while it's not bad, it's noticeable, but I think it's still a great sunscreen that's worth a shot if you're looking for something that won't make your skin feel like a slip-n-slide.",4
"I've used the Ponds Luminous Cleanser with mixed results.  It was far too rich for my skin.  I was a bit leery in trying these but in the end, I'm glad I did.These wipes are very good at removing eye makeup.  There are days when all I wear is mascara and lip gloss.  My mascara is waterproof and the wipes removed it all.  No raccoon eyes or little flakes of dried makeup.  It took it all off.  I used it on the rest of my face and was disgusted to see dark brown patches on the wipes--the remnants of dirt that my regular cleanser did not take off.The scent is almost overpoweringly and smells like roses. That's its' only con. It's not too wet and has a quilted feel to them.  My entire face was amazingly smooth after using it once.",4
I bought this top coat a couple weeks ago from my local Sally's on sale. I was going to order it but read bad reviews and it made me nervous to pay 8 or 9 dollars for it when I know my OPI regular top coat is a good one. But I found this on sale at Sally's for like $4 and bought it.I could not be any happier with this product. It dries super fast and that is awesome for me because I have very little patience. I always end up putting away all my manicure supplies after waiting about a minute instead of waiting for my nails to dry and ALWAYS end up smearing my nail polish and putting dents in it. But this stuff dries so fast I don't have to worry about that.It is not 100% dry in seconds though. You still have to wait before putting away laundry or things that would typically damage partially dry nails. The top is dry but the stuff underneath is not. So its easy to put ripples in your nails from the polish sliding if you run it over something. I typically do my nails about 20 mins or so before going to bed and the top coat is dry enough that it causes no problems and the bottom stuff is dry by morning so my manicure is fully set.I've also read a lot of complaints about it chipping super easy. I have not noticed chipping any more than with a typical top coat. My nails peel pretty bad though and I still have that issue but I found out recently OPI makes a Nail Envy base coat specifically to fix that so I'll probably try that with my Seche Vite and I'm sure that will help.,5
"This body wash not only makes my skin smell great but it feels great too!I do notice a different in my arms especially and my skin is also really soft and hydrated.A little goes a long way so it really lasts. It's worth the price, and i really think i will pick this up again in the future.",5
"Curel has never been at the top of my list of preferred skin lotion because it did not absorb well leaving behind a sticky, greasy film.  Not sure if it is a revamped formula or if my skin has finally hit the required level of dry flakiness necessary to make use of the produce, but that is not an issue with this.  Rough Skin Rescue does not cure the dry skin but twice a day use has been beneficial.  The biggest drawback is the price.  It costs 3 times what Eucerin costs and 5 times more than Suave Professional Moroccan Oil Infusion which works just as well.",4
"Hi, I bought this product with high hopes afer reading some great reviews.  I used it for about a month and did not really notice any improvement in my skin (but sometimes it is hard to tell when you look at yourself everyday).  I didn't recieve any compliments about how great my skin looked during this time, but I thought, hey, just give it time..... than after about a month, my face swelled up....bad.  I thought that if I continued using it, that the reaction would go away and I would see some results, so I continued using it for over a week and my face looked BAD.  It was swollen and looked like I was a having a serious allergic reaction. It was bumpy and red and itchy and I looked like I was recuperating from a bad sunburn or chemical peel. I had to stop using it, I was in so much pain.  I tried it again after a couple weeks and instantly my face was swollen and red again for 3 days.  Sigh.... I was really hoping this would work.  Back to the drawing board......",2
"I don't usually use body wash, preferring artisan soaps. I like other Nature's Gate products, so thought I would give this a try. It smells nice, but not too strong. It washes well and feels smooth. The pump makes this really convenient and there is no soggy lump of soap that one often finds in the shower...My bottle arrived slightly damaged. The top of the pump has a chip out of it, but still works. Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag in the box, because it leaked a little. It still works so I'm ok with it.  I would probably buy this again.",5
"...that they are going to be making different washing formulations for this. I only have acne when I eat too much chocolate, which is not very often, so I can't see myself keeping this permanently filled with acne cleanser, but I really do like the convenience and sleekness of the dispenser. Yes, there are a lot of soap dispensers coming out now. The company that recognizes that people only want one dispenser (or, at most, two) but they want to be able to change out the types of liquid it dispenses could really have something going on.I've tried the Soothing Plant Extracts one so far, and it feels good on my skin and really cleans. I can tell, though, that it would be a lot better for younger and less dry skin than my sixty-year-old face sports. How nice it would be if they'd release a formulation of cleanser/exfoliator/toner for older skin, too. Or perhaps a third party would make refills for this product.I hope the batteries that came with it last a good while. That would be my only reason for not using this dispenser on a regular basis, if it eats batteries. I can't see that it would, though.",4
"As mentioned, I have very fine hair.  Without the right shampoo/conditioner, it is lifeless and super straight.  I constantly work to find something that I like that is not super smelly or expensive.  This is pretty good.  The shampoo is really thick, which I actually liked.  It made me feel like I could use a little less (which probably is the recommended size) and still get a clean feeling.  I used this paired with the conditioner and have been happy with the result.",5
"I buy the little Aveeno for everywhere and this is a great size for the car and purse. Nourishing, but never greasy. This is my favorite.",5
"This is a nice, light weight, leave in conditioner that protects against heat damage when using a dryer. It works well, especially for thin or fine hair, as it does not make your hair oily at all. I love it. I use it every time I use a blow dryer.",5
"I love the smell and feel of this conditioner, but so far, I am not seeing any improvements in my hair's texture.  I have coarse, fine and curly hair.  It is color-treated and the grays still peek through the color.  I have been using this product for 5 days and cannot tell much difference.  So, my recommendation would be that it is a good conditioner, but not much different than any other.",3
"I purchased this item a month ago when I got facial acne which I hasn't been getting for a while. I started with Ole Henriksen blemish serum (costs $45!), which didn't do anything on my acne after 3 weeks of use. I had to search online, and eventually found this magical mask. I have combination skin and I used it as a spot treatment overnight. My acne retreated after only a few days of use. I also used it as a mask once a week. My face is clean and acne free now. This product is so effective plus great price! Who says you need to pay more to get the job done?! Very happy with it! I wish I had known about it in the first place!",5
"The smell of the Pantene Curly Hair Series shampoo is just great.  I am pleased that it performed on my hair very well.  I have always had dry hair, and this shampoo lives up to ""Dry to Moisturized"" claim.  It made my hair feel soft, manageable and, yes, smell delightful.  I recommend this product to anyone who has dry, unmanageable, curly hair.",5
"I have very fine, delicate hair which tangles a lot when wet. It's a Ten, applied as a leave-in after shampooing, detangles, smooths, protects, and leaves my hair with more body. I no longer need a conditioner after the shampoo. I consider it essential to my hair and appearance. Only problem is the bottle which sprays the product. It's hard to get a good grip on it-slippery, and hard to tell if the spray has gotten all over my head. I just put it in another bottle without a spray and apply with my hands. So does my hair dresser.",5
"It's ok, but too cumbersome for me to apply. I can't tell a difference what the 2 separate creams/gels are supposed to do.  I prefer an overall eye cream that can be gently applied to the entire / upper and lower eye area.Neutrogena as well as L'oreal have very good products and are probably a little more reasonable.",3
"I  discovered this when i was in France, they had Bioderma in each pharmacy and it was much cheaper!So i bought it again only thing i dont like u need a big amoaunt of product to clean tour face and u have to really rub it in your eye area to clean all mascara so i dont think its strong enough. I use to have Bi Facil and seems now it worked better for me",3
"This product works great! My skin is sooo soft. It's gentle, but gets the job done. Worth the money, would buy again.",5
Awesome as usual. All thier products are wonderful for my 3b curly hair.  only complaint is the scent is too strong for those with fragrance senitivities.  JessiCurl make no fragrance 3b curly hair products.,5
Bought this for a 2-week trip to Chile.  Worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on High Heat and High Fan when operating on 220.  Once I got home to the US I moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now.  It has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate.The retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it's easier to store at home too.,5
"This conditioner is a great complement to the shampoo of the same brand.  The conditioner not only helps restore moisture to your scalp but it also helps protect your color and prevent future damage. It is color-safe and it coats the hair completely and sinks into your strands helping them feel softer and it made my hair shiny too. Some of the ingredients include Nutrium 10 which is touted as ""an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients"" and they include vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera. The scent lingers even after your hair is dry and isn't overpowering when applying. It rinses cleanly but your hair still feels coated like it soaked the protective elements into the shaft.",5
"I have thin, fine, limp hair. This thickening serum brings my hair to life.....the absolute best hair body building product that I have ever, ever used. I am 66 yrs old and a retired hair stylist...have used many products... high cost & low cost. This is very highly recommended. Just remember don't use to much. I have chin length hair & used about three small pumps. Play around with it....use your blow dryer with your head down and hair forward until its half way dry.....this will do wonders...use a brush to shape your hair the way u want it. Try using it different ways.",5
"Overall I really like this product.  I have wanted a curling wand for several months but never had the money for the brand I was eyeing, this is a decent substitute.  I have layered hair that is maybe 3 inches passed the top of my shoulders.  I didn't have any problems with using this and I also don't style my hair very often so it isn't that I'm a pro already.  I didn't like the look of my hair after weaving it around both rods so I just use one instead and it came out great, though it took some getting used to having to bypass the second rod.  I added a picture.  I will definitely use this on a regular basis.  I love the body it gives my hair.  I have color-treated straight fine hair that doesn't hold much of a curl after the first hour, but the style I created actually stayed in my hair all evening and night, until bed.  It took about 20-25 minutes the first time to do my entire head.  I am right handed thus hold the styler with my right hand and it makes curling the right side of my head a little more cumbersome.  The glove takes getting used to when sectioning your hair while wearing it but it is necessary.  I am thinking about replacing the glove that came with it with a better quality one.",4
I'm happy to say this has improved the look and feel of my skin.  It's made my face so smooth and it feels so clean after I use this.  I can really see the improvement in how my face looks.I use this in the shower and it's easy to hold on to.  I have long nails and the buttons are very easy to push.  It comes with a microdermabrasion foam head and a cleansing brush head.  I like the way the microdermabrasion head makes my face feel.  My skin feels like it has had layers of dead skin removed and it's bright and shiny.  I didn't realize how old dead skin on the face can make us look!  I'm really pleased with how well this product works.,5
"I need hairspray which is strong yet easy to comb through when I need to.  I also need something that will hold fine hair and that will bounce back in various situations so I don't have to keep spraying.This unscented version of the hairspray is definitely unscented.  It has a little bit of a chemical smell at first, but it is light and fades quickly.  It will hold my hair decently but it does not encourage curl or wave as well as a few others I have tried.For volume and flexible hold it is fabulous, however.  It has held my hair and that of people I know in the most extreme winds and humidity.  It is amazing how my hair looks completely different when I use Unscented Elnett on my hair- full and nice instead of flat.",5
It clips but its just to small. I can't use them. I used one of them in my wig cap that I created and it needs to be bigger. I think it is better to get wig combs and put in the wig cap rather than this product.,2
"I love this brush. I use it for bronzer and blush, and while I was skeptical at first, its shape is really perfect for these, because it really helps get the makeup right where you want it, while also blending it into your face so it is very natural looking.",5
"I've never had a wax job before so was pleasantly surprised by how nice it felt. Just stick the bottle of oil in to heat up and then roll it on and use strips. Very easy. You will have to keep the oil heated up all the time though or else it will get hard and really sticky and create a mess (yes, I created one). Wax job is supposed to last 5 to 6 weeks and it does. Good product, good price.",5
"I have hypothyroidism, and as others who have this know, it can make your hair look and feel like straw and thin  out. I've done a natural curls journey for a year now (don't straighten/blow out hair, mostly use products that are wholly or mostly based on herbs and natural oils). But I was getting a trim and decided to just let them do the treatment there (though I usually do protein treatments at home, either K-Pak by Joico or Repair me! by Curl junkie or the Spiral Solutions Repairing Protein treatment).This stuff is great. Expensive (in salon, the one treatment was 45 bucks before tips/tax/etc). My curls tightened up (this is what usually happens when my hair is protein treated, it streghtens my curl pattern, which is great). My frizz was down. My hair was softer and it literally FELT thickened (I have very fine hair).So, a thumbs up for the two-step treatment on this product. Make sure to use the conditioner after (all protein treatments of high strength should be moisturization after, or your hair can feel dry).I don't know if this is a fair price or fair shipping, but I did want to say the product give excellent results for dry/damaged/weak/thin hair.",5
"I like the sponges, they do work really well in foundation application. But I really can't tell the difference between these and the cheaper imitations. I don't like the cleanser. I had to do multiple rounds of soaping and lathering before I could get the sponge to a point where I'd be comfortable using it again the next day...even then some foundation color remained. For the price, it's not worth it in my opinion.",3
My friend swears by this and since she lives in NY and never has time to shop because of work I have gifted her this product for xmas. she is not a minority but has extremely wavy hair and was spending $100 every month to keep her hair straight. This works. Stated it is not harsh but very gentle and effects lasts for 3 months.,5
"Yesss.. I had got the original silicon mix 35oz. And the bambu 8oz, I wish I had did the other way around, don't get me wrong the original works but not as good as the bambu is gives your hair more of a bounce and it smells so much better so Im going to purches the 16 oz",5
"I was surprised by how nice this brush is. The handle has a nice weight and the brush hairs are very soft. I've never used anything like it before and found the application of make up to give a full coverage. Or I could be doing it wrong? Anyway, I'm glad I purchased it. Better than spending tons of money on one from MAC or somewhere.",4
LA GIRL Pro Conceal is a great concealer. It is recommend by so many makeup artist . Now I can see why.,5
"I wasn't sure what to expect in trying this out. I've never used one before. But the thought process is that this penetrates below the skin and breaks up tissue creating a smoother look. It is not a quick use-quick results product but will take regular use and definite adjustment. The pins on this need to be pushed below the skin. If you are super sensitive, you may not be able to use this. This is a medium length pin (1.0 mm) and although the box says it can be used 3-4 times a week, there is documentation from others that it should not be used that often. There is certainly no benefit to using it every day as your skin needs time to heal. This is not to be used lightly so I recommend anyone trying it reads up on using a derma roller before doing so. Also, it is important to thoroughly clean it between uses and do not share it with anyone else.This model is easy to grip, rolls smoothly and cleans up easily. It has a nice storage container that can tuck into a bathroom drawer or closet. Nicely finished and sturdy too. I was provided a sample for testing and review.",5
"It came in the eyeshadows are a bit small so not for alot of use on each, but also 2 of the colors had broken during shipping. :(",3
"I love this soap, it smells so fresh and clean and fruity! I have noticed it seems not to dry my hands out like other soaps.",5
"For those people with dry hair, this will help. You can rub a little on your hands and run your hands thru your hair and it will definitely look less frizzy. I usually put a little on my hair and leave it for a few hours and then wash my hair since I can't stand it looking the least bit greasy. My hair seemed more manageable after only a few uses. Great product and smells good too.",5
"Although I have relatively clear skin, my skin tone is very uneven. I often suffer from terrible redness and peeling that is extremely difficult to cover up with makeup, not to mention somewhat painful. I purchased PhytoRenew because of its promises to help with redness and the good reviews. I have only been using it a little while, but I believe I am already seeing results. My face doesn't feel as inflamed as it usually does, and I am experiencing a pleasant tightness that I absolutely love. I am certain that with continued use, the redness will diminish even more and that I might even see some noticeable improvement to the tiny wrinkles appearing at my eyes.",5
This is my very first hair dryer & I really like it. Though I have used it only for few times I can say it works really fast. No regrets yet. Too good for the price.,5
"I like to use it on my bangs when they are wet and blow dry, keeps them straight and soft lookinggood to put on the ends of hair when dry also",4
"I normally love OPI Products but this selection was not for me.So don't let my speculations, deter you from buying...Ref. OPI Red Shatter Crackle Nail Polish E55 NewHave a nice day",3
"I have been using Egyptian magic as my sole facial moisturizer for about four years now.  Nothing has come close to performing as this product does and I have tried countless products.  At first try, it may seem too greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves a radiant glow.  I do not wear any makeup and I love how Egyptian Magic makes my skin look and feel.  I feel like I look much better without makeup actually.  I add about two-three drops of Argan Oil to just a small (pea-sized) dollop of Egyptian magic and smooth it all over my face and neck.  I usually come back about 15 minutes after I apply it and smooth my hands over my face once again just to help the remaining greasiness absorb.  By that time, I am good to go and my skin looks healthy and glowing, not greasy.  I'm sure that this would not work for all skin types, but for mine it does.  I would say that I have combination skin...greasier in some spots, dry in others.  Egyptian Magic helps to balance it all out.  The greasy spots don't get greasy during the day and the dry spots don't dry out.I struggled for years before finding skin products that worked for me and I found that most natural....least ingredients is the prescription for me.  I use pure honey and a microfiber cloth to cleanse, Egyptian Magic and Moroccan Argan oil to moisturize, coffee grounds to exfoliate and Aztec SecretAztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clayevery few weeks to clarify.",5
This product deserves 5 stars!It curls my hair perfectly and you can set the temperature of heat that you want.It gives nice curls =],5
"I got these a week after I ordered them, they came before the estimated delivery date which is a plus!  I tested all the plates and all the designs.  They stamped clean and crisp, even with a regular nail polish (I used Color Club Haute Couture).  I love the variety offered on these plates and I definitely bought them for the moustache plate.  But the rest of the designs are great, the leopard print on the first plate is so detailed!  These plates cover my nails and may be a smidgen bigger than a Konad full-size image.  A very good investment and great quality.",5
These product is old i not to sure how it is going to do up against the glue. I sure am going to be working with the stickers. The price was right that is  why I brought the gold metal stickers.,4
"This hair dryer has great power, three heat settings and dries my hair faster than my last model. A great purchase a good price! I'm happy that I bought this!",5
"Nice smell, it reminds me of Joop! but a little sweeter. I got this for work so I don't need to use expensive cologne, it lasts about 4 hours so you may need to respray, but for $10 not bad.",4
This moisturizer feels good on my skin and does not cause any allergic reaction as some products I've used have. The sunscreen which is minimal is a bonus for days when I might be exposed to sun just a bit. I use additional sunscreen for real outdoor activity! I will buy this product again!,5
"I'm usually the kind that doesn't need ""frills"" and if a product works great, I can deal with smell or looks or feel, etc. I am more interested in a product working than the frills that come with it. Well I could not do that with this product. It stunk so bad that you could smell me wherever I went. The smell faded at the end of the day but you'd stink almost a whole day after using it. And the bad thing is that it didn't even work well enough to make it worth the stench. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to this product. Instead I went with Raw African Organic Shea Butter. No frills and smell isn't great but it doesn't linger at all and works fantastic. I have really dry skin and the ""chicken bumps"" and was really wanting a cure from this product - nope.",2
"At medium-high hold, this mousse works for my various hair styles (spiky to combed). Application to dry hair lowers the hold, but running wet fingers through your hair after application will stiffen the hold.If you are looking for a natural alternative to your current styling product, I recommend giving this one a try.Many ""organic"" products are loaded with toxic preservatives. Giovanni Natural Mousse is the only medium hold hair styling product I've found without sulfates, benzoate, or paraben preservatives.  Check out the Skin Deep page on Environmental Working Group's site for toxicity info.The container is recyclable.  The mousse is dispensed with a pump and not aerosol. Amazon's price is also much lower than any you will find at Whole Foods or other organic stores.",5
i found these by accident and what a blessing.  when i wash my brushes (everytime i use them) i place them in these guards and the brushes stay the way i purchased them!  they're like new!  i also feel confident when traveling that my brushes won't get messed up at all because these guards protect as well as keep them in their original shape!,5
Love these!!!!!,5
"The Bioderma is a fabulous addition to your skin care collection.  I use it to clean off excess mascara after my cleansing routine.  I wear waterproof mascara, and I find I need a more powerful remover to take that off, but I clean up the residue with Bioderma.  I hear it's also good for cleaning off makeup and making quick changes to your routine.  This is completely non-irritating to my eyes, feels wonderful and refreshing on the skin, and I would highly recommend it.  If you want to use the smaller bottle, then buy only those.  I bought one small and one large, thinking I could refill the smaller bottle, but NO--these are not American-made bottles and even with my tiniest funnel, it was extremely difficult to transfer, so I wouldn't bother.  Either use the large bottle or buy smaller bottles for regular everyday use.",5
"I bought this shampoo originally to help keep by red hair red. Unfortunately it didn't really do anything for color protection. However I will still continue to use this because I love the smell and it makes my hair really soft. As far as keeping my hair red, the best solution I've found is to mix a little bit of temporary hair dye, I use Alfaparf &#34;Chili Red&#34;, with my conditioner and it keeps my hair continuously red and a lot less of a hassle that way because this brand of temporary dye is similar to a conditioner texture as it is.",3
This product left my hair in a knotted mess & very dull.  Almost impossible to get comb in hair.  Really disappointed.,1
This makes my hair so soft and shiny! I love the tiny gold reflective sparkles in it--like gold dust for my hair!,5
"I normally use a fairly popular prime from a mineral make up company but I did not want to spend the money for a small bottle again so I figured I would give this stuff a shot. I am pleasantly surprised at how it feels on the skin. I got it in the green because I have redness that I am not thrilled about. This primer is very soft in texture and almost like silk on the skin. I wash my face, put on a moisturizer, wait for it to dry, then apply this primer, then do my make up. It dries quickly and absorbs a little bit. It really smooths out the skin to get it ready for make up. I have noticed that my make up sticks better when I use this and it is easier to remove as well. So, I recommend this stuff even if you just try it. For the price, it is worth it. I will buy another once I run out which I don't see happening for awhile because there is a lot of product and I barely have to use any. Makes it even more worth the money.",4
"I got this instead of getting the more expensive Nars one. This is too sparkly and clearly visible on skin. It doesnt blend well. I was hoping to use it for contouring, but don't think I will end up using it.",3
"This is one of the best beauty items I own. I tried the Soho one first and this blows it out of the water. It is so soft and blends my foundation and concealer FLAWLESSLY. I use this over my brushes most of the time. I love the shape, the pointed end is great for under the eyes and around the nose. Definitely would recommend spending the extra money for this one instead of all the dupes out there.",5
"Perfect for the guy who needs to comb through and go. Because it's a foam not the spray on powder, it dries better without the powdery residue so many of the dry shampoos have.",5
"Great moisturizer, the only complaint I had was the greasiness in getting it off. It a bit tough to get off your face becasue if the greasiness, I used St. Ives apricot scrub to help with getting it off and it works great.",4
"Great color, great coverage.  Can be worn for any occassion or for no occassion at all.  Hot pink; can't go wrong with pink, period.",5
"This is the first Ecotools brush I've owned and it won't be the last! It is very soft, durable, and easy to use. It doesn't pick up too much product which is perfect for a blush brush. It spreads the blush out evenly.",5
"Its soap, we stay clean, it is a great price (if its the add on offer from Amazon) and its about a yrs worth for the house so its nice not to have to worry about running out!!",5
It made my really fine hair super frizzy at the top. It smells awesome but I just couldn't stand having so many yucky flyaway/frizzes on the top of my head. Ended up tossing it out.,2
"It's a true brown, so I love that.  But you won't get the extension of some other mascaras (like Dior, Definicils or Buxom).  I'm not thrilled about the brush since it doesn't really help to separate/define my lashes.",3
"Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free Face Powder is a great product that I would happily recommend. This works well, for overall coverage, smoothes out your complexion and is an effective cover up, as well. I found that it helped minimize the appearance of pimples and other facial imperfections, without appearing too caked on or artificial. Great product.",5
I have bought several since my first time using it. It seems to protect my hair. I use it before blow drying and before styling my dry hair EVERY TIME. Since using it I have also bought it for a few friends or family members who are really enjoying it also. This lasts a long time but I do not always blow dry or style my hair with heat everyday. More like a few times a week. For the price this is some pretty awesome spray. I would absolutely recommend using it.,5
"Asian user with fair skin - matched well! I bought this stick with the intention of using it as an under eye concealer...unfortunately, it's a thick product. It has good coverage for redness and blemishes, has staying power, and blends well without looking caked on.",4
I've been using this product for a while now and I can absolutely say that I will never buy another conditioner anywhere else. Yeah it  might be a little pricey but for me a bottle lasts about a year and a few months. I have 4b/4c and this makes my hair feel amazingly soft.,5
Bought this to try to see how it compared to my current topcoat of OPI. I really like this topcoat because it dries so fast and it's nice when you have an impatient 3 and 5 year old always wanting or needing help with something.,5
"Silver nail polish is, by far, my favorite color. I buy silver nail polish almost every time I see it. This is one of my favorite silver shades i own, or have ever seen. In the sun it shimmers green and blue and I absolutely love it. The formula is a bit thin, but adding a second coat or a good thick first coat easily solves that. The color lasted me about a week before it began to peel, which is a pretty long time for polish to last on my nails.",5
I am not thrilled with this product.  If I had no other choice I would use the straightener but in no way would I use the sleeves that come with it.  Even the straightener is not as good as several other brands I have used.  I think Remington should stick to making razors.,3
I needed something natural that I could trust on my sensitive skin to start combating the beginning signs of aging on my skin. This fit the bill for me and I'm happy with the results so far.,5
"This palette comes in two designs, the Naughty and the Nice.  The Naughty version features pinup girls.  The shadows are the same.  I bought this palette on a whim from Haute Look.  I've had it for a while now and I have to say that it is one of my favorite palettes.Many people wonder, I think, if this palette is an alternative to the Urban Decay Naked palettes or if owning both or all is redundant.  I have Naked 1.  My Mom has Naked 2.  I think that Nude Tude is more different from Naked 1 and 2 than Naked 1 and 2 are to each other.  This palette has several shades that are not even CLOSE to shades in those palettes. I don't know Naked 2 as well, so I'm going to stick with Naked 1 comparisons. The pinks (Stubborn and Selfish), for example, are nothing like Sin.  Not only are the shades totally different, hey are more shimmery, like pinker versions of Sidecar in Naked 1.  There is a burgundy color (Sexy) in this palette, which I love.  Sassy is brighter than Virgin.  Snobby is yellower than Half Baked.  Serious is a true black.  Naked 1 doesn't have a true black (Naked 2 does).  There is no equivalent to Selfish.  I'd say that the only real dupe is Sultry, which is just like Buck in Naked 1.So if you are interested in this one, rest assured - you can own the UD Naked palette too and not find them redundant.  Quality is also great.  The shadows go on well.  They are pigmented and buttery.  I do get some fallout if I forget to tap my brush.  But the fallout is pretty minor.  I do wear them with primer and get no creasing for more than 15 hours.  They also don't fade.",5
"I'm trying to get these to work with some of my regular polish as others have said they have done.  So far, I'm not getting the 2 weeks wear time some so they get.  I will keep experiment with different cure times, etc.",4
"First, let me give you some background on my hair.  I am a white female of european decent.  I had Shirley Temple style blonde curls until about the age of 4 when my hair turned brown and frizzy.  The frizz is tamable with just a hair dryer and a round brush in the cooler months, but come spring and summer, just the slightest bit of humidity (or if I sweat) and my hair frizzes in a most unattractive way.  I get a protein smoothing infusion which tames the frizz, but it still loses style.  Since my hair is thick, I have it layered.  I wear it shoulder length with bangs.So, I've seen the infomercial and I've read the reviews on here.  Since my hair isn't ethnic, super short and somewhat cooperative with the flat iron, I thought I'd run out to Target and pick it up for a trip to Florida tomorrow.  Of course I tried it as soon as I got home.It heats up quickly.  I like that I can use the hand not holding the styler to guide it.  The barrel gets hot, but the brush is touchable.  It takes a slow pass, or several short passes.  It's definitely not a 3 minute job, like the infomercial professes.  It takes about as long as it would with a flat iron.I have to say that it did a pretty decent job of getting my hair to look freshly blow dried before the frizz sets in.  It's easier to style with this and direct my hair than it is with a flat iron.As far as making my hair shiny - it already was from the protein treatment from my hair salon - but the perfecter didn't burn or dry out my hair either.",4
"Love love love love this product. It's so amazing. I was originally using the light defining gel, but my hair's grown 4+ inches in the last year, so it was time to step up the hold with the ultra. Would highly recommend.",5
I use this when I feel a migraine coming on due to ovulation. I tried to use it for a month straight but it caused a very painful menstruated cycle. I will continue to use prior to ovulation along with Advil to relieve some of my migraines.,5
"I have been using this product for a year or two, and I wouldn't do without it, especially in the winter when my skin starts to flake with dryness.  Because I have sensitive and often dry skin, I have to be careful about what soap-like products I apply.  I use a mesh body sponge, and the lather is thick and creamy with only a teaspoon or so of body wash.  The only thing I don't like about it is the tapered top that makes it tough when I'm running out and want to store it upside down.  I have to balance it against the shower wall.I highly recommend this for anyone who has dry or sensitive skin.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5
Good quality colors are true and shining love itI will recommend  this product is a perfect deal my nails look cute,5
"I know Bare Escentuals touts the usefulness of this product, but I've used it for several weeks and cannot see what - if anything - it is doing for my complexion.",3
I was hoping this would work but it didn't. It didn't fit and hair kept falling out so I wouldn't recommend wearing this out anywhere important if you decide to go ahead and buy it. The cut is cute but the quality just isn't there. I had to return it.,2
"I ordered these brushes, praying that the blush brush would be soft & not hard on my skin. I'm so glad I did. This is probably the nicest, highest quality brush I've ever used. I am so pleased. All of the brushes are nice! I also really needed a nice angle brush for my eyebrows. Comes in a nice lil carrying bag. Great for the price too! Don't let the price fool you, these are very nice & made well. Def a good purchase!",5
PEFRECT!!! I have NEVER had a mascara that has came on like this one. I LOVE IT!!! The eyeliner is cheap and breaks off easily though.,5
"I don't have these personally, but I have heard so many great things about them. Once again, you get a HUGE color selection for a WONDERFUL price. Check these out!",5
This cream soaks in immediately and leaves no sticky or gummy residue.  I break out quite easily and this cream has been great for my skin.  I was feeling a bit depressed about my skin at 60 because I was breaking out. . .with this cream my skin is much better.  GREAT CREAM!!!,5
"The proactiv brand is just too expensive for the sizes you get. Used it for years before switching to Basis face cleanser. Also it worked OK, but wasn't the best product line.",3
"I bought this toner to try something new to get rid of my acne scars & prevent new bouts of pimples from recurring on my face. It worked wonderfully for fighting the pimples- I've been using it for over a month, and I have not had ONE new pimple since using it. However, I have not seen any significant difference in the scarring as far as the ""fading"" aspect of the product. Hopefully, my skin is just stubborn and I need to use it a little longer, but this is a bit disappointing. It's a great product otherwise.Also- It does sting if you have tiny cuts or open pores on your face. I've gotten used to the sting, but sometimes it is quite strong (ie, after getting my eyebrows waxed).",4
"Smells a little funny and made my eyes sting a bit. Just not fore me, so I gave it 2 my sister.",2
"Mom first got this as a sample size from the hairdresser and bought a regular sized one after.  In an attempt to save money, after that bottle ran out, she bought the popular Tresseme hair spray on Amazon.  The Tresseme spray does not even begin to compare and leaves her hair flat and limp. This gives it a lot more volume/fluff (she is short and blow drys her short hair with a round brush to give her an extra inch ;)). We will keep buying this kenra spray even though it is more expensive than many other brands.",5
"I have really long, thick hair and I bought this to help make a bun on the top of my head.  My hair seems way too long for this little donut.  I need to buy the bigger one!",3
"I always buy OPI. Other brands streak, peels off and do not last long on my nails. OPI does not do that. Worth the higher price to be confident my nails will stay looking good.",5
"Using this shampoo is like taking a head-trip to Hawaii.  Inhaling the rich, sweet coconut milk scent of this shampoo reminds ms of a splendid, sunny day I spent on Waikiki, slathering Hawaiian Tropics all over my skin and thinking of absolutely nothing but the sun, sand, and surf.  Everytime I lather this creamy, milky shampoo into my hair, I forget I am standing in a freezing bathroom in Alaska and slip into a delicious fantasy of me bathing in a waterfall in Kauai!There is one warning about this shampoo though:  it cleanses your hair like a clarifying shampoo.  It leaves your hair very clean but a tad on the dry side like when you use a clarifying shampoo.  I use a great conditioner from Aveda - one that has a coconut, grapefruit scent and it works great.",3
"This product lives up to it's claim. I use a combination of coconut milk and Dr. Bronner's Almond Castile Soap as a shampoo, and was using organic honey as a conditioner but my hair was still a bit stringy. I decided to give this stuff a try, along with the lavender leave in, and so glad I did! Not going to lie, the first time I used it I was a little frightened - the smell is overpowering (because it's super duper concentrated), and the color/texture leaves something to be desired (it's brown and a little chunky), but after I used it I could immediately tell the difference.Make sure you follow the directions and finger comb it through your hair before rinsing - you will notice a difference (learned that the hard was just yesterday). And keep it away from your eyes - it stings. a lot. and even if you get it near your eyes, because of the smell it may still burn.",5
"this is definetly an easy way how to make a simple desing.  just paint your nail with a color base, any color , choose white or any other that you prefer and print it.Keep a cotton with polish remover and a dry towel so you can clean the plate and the stamper after every nail application.  Clean it and dry it so you can get the paint stick to the aplicator again.First time I couldn't do it but then I learn, so be patient... you can also find internet videos that teach you how.",5
"They have to be modified a bit, and the lash line is thick, but other wise, good steal, especially if you wear falsies a lot and don't re-use them",3
"I'm writing this after I realized none of my friends knew about this mascara.I was given a tube at an event in 2009 and I haven't found anything better since. It has its drawbacks, but they are few:PROS:- Stays on until you take it off. Literally. Like, you could wear it for days.- Doesn't smudge ANYWHERE. It basically forms into a solid when you put it on. It won't rub off or go anywhere.- It's water RESISTANT. (not proof, see Cons)- It's easy to get it all off at once.- It makes your lashes look like &#34;natural&#34; falsiesCONS:- It doesn't come off with regular eye makeup remover.- If it gets touched by warm or hot water, it clumps and comes off in tubes - i.e. hot yoga- It's not very graceful to remove.- After about two to three months, you have to pitch it and buy a new one.- Looks gross stuck to the shower when it comes off.I know &#34;they&#34; say to throw away mascara after a couple months, but with this one you really have to. Once it dries out, it doesn't look great and it's really difficult to remove.The easiest way to remove it is to put warm water on your lashes, either directly under the shower stream or with a washcloth. It will almost fall off and it doesn't adhere to or leave residue on your lashes.Another tip: If you like to do multiple layers, wait until the first one dries so it builds. Since this mascara builds a tube around your lash, adding another while it's wet will only pull the previous layer off. For extra definition, use both the base coat and the mascara on top of your top lashes too.Because it can be a little high-maintenance, I mostly use it for long days or nights out. It's my &#34;special&#34; mascara. I use good old Maybelline Great Lash on a daily basis. But despite the extra care and the cons above, this is a great mascara to keep in your arsenal.",4
If it doesn't work for you then you aren't using it properly! This is my first time EVER doing this to my face or even purchasing something like this but OH BOY does it work! I am satisfied with it and I'm sure there are better products out there but this does it for me and the price...can't beat that. I did a youtube search on how to use this and also google and that's how I figured out how to use this gadget =D hope this helps,4
but is not to big I dont like the lipstick colors and some are shadows are brokencome on time,3
I've been using this line for a while now and I totally love them. So much so that this past Christmas I added them as stuffers for all my girlfriends- amazing feedback! Total hit!FIVE STARS for colorsFIVE STARS for staying powerI won't hesitate to buy these again- just to get the colors I don't already have.(Annie),5
I mix this with a base lotion and a few other products and the combination seems to be working well on the fine lines I have.  I am 49 and I was starting to show my age.  I have recently gotten a lot of compliments about my glowing skin and people telling me I look well rested.  I am not well rested because I suffer from insomnia so the combination of products I use seem to be working.,4
I over exfolliated my skin and it was really dry. I used this and overnight it repaired it including underneath my eyes. Pretty amazing stuff!,5
"I have a set of Conair rollers from 2008 that are flocked and work great, but the set only has 8 large rollers in it. I need at least 20 to do all of my hair. So I bought this to supplement that set.I have long (just below bra strap), thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that is very easy to curl, and holds curl for a long time.I used both sets at the same time so I could compare how they worked.This set does not get nearly as hot as my other set. But, I left them in for at least 20 minutes, and the curls they made were nearly identical to those made by the older set of rollers.I found that the little set of teeth on one side of these rollers really helped grip my hair so I could wrap it around each roller.The size of the large rollers in this set is just a bit smaller than the large in my other Conair set- but those also have the fuzzy coating on them. This difference in size between the two sets did not seem to make the curls look any different, though.I think the key with this set is to let it heat up with the lid zipped for at least 10 minutes, if not a bit longer.Based on my first use of the set, I feel it gives me what I was looking for: nice full waves and smooth, shiny hair. I also like that the set is small and compact and takes up much less counter space than my older set.Given that these rollers do not ever reach a high temperature, they might not work as well for people whose hair doesn't hold curl well. I am actually pleasantly surprised that they made curls identical to the hotter set, as it seems there is less heat damage I will subject my hair to if I continue to use these on a regular basis.",4
"This product is way better than the cheaper ones like conair that you can get at grocery stores. It is very sleak design and the hair straightening effect is smoother, longer lasting and convenient.highly recommend it. I love the digital screen.",5
"I don't know what is going on when I see other people giving this creme less than 5 stars. I love this glossing creme and have found it to be wonderful for taming my wild and crazy hair, and adding tons of shine as well!I have fine, graying hair which I color treat, and I really am particular about my hair. Fekkai usually comes through with good products, especially for people ( sigh ... like me) who have troubles with frizzy hair as well. This product provides a smoothing quality which I find terrific.If you have marvelous, long, thick, silken tresses, hey!!! What are you reading this review for?Go become a hair model for Pete's sake!But if you have incredibly frustrating hair like mine, try this.Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is a good value price wise, and a very nice product.Thanks,jean",5
OPI is just about the best nail polish around. I found these a great value since I do go through so much base coat and top coat.,5
"I got two Motions products--this one (Define My Curls Cr&egrave;me) and The Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding.  While the pudding has the consistency of a cr&egrave;me or conditioner, the Cr&egrave;me is a thick product, similar in consistency to Vaseline.Applied to towel-dried, damp hair, the product is kind of thick to comb through.  It is recommended to define curls and dry this product under a hooded dryer for best results.  Since it is so thick, this might be best if you want to dry it quickly.Used in a recommended manner, this product does make my hair look like I combed it through with Vaseline, but I do have fine dry hair.  A small amount of product could be used to define curls, just don't overdo it.  This product does really handle frizz (by weighting it down) but I tend to prefer the Pudding to the Cr&egrave;me.Ultimately, your hair type and specific needs will determine whether this product is right for you.  For me, this Cr&egrave;me is definitely too thick and greasy.",3
"Got this stuff in my eye and had to go to ER, ended up with tiny blisters inside my lower eyelid. Had to have eye rinsed out with saline solution for 20 minutes. Doc gave me antibiotics, and a pain prescription. In bed for 3 days. Now have lashes dyed at salon.",1
"I usually use Dove's for men full body thickening shampoo which is pretty good but this full-blown shampoo really is very good.It seems that I use less of this to get some more lather and it seems to give it just a little bit more &#34;oomf&#34;.It has a nice scent that seems to stay with the hair for a while too.As others have said, does seem to have more of a conditioner feel to it so if you like your hair more manageable this may be a little bit too soft , but for me I really like it !****Jim",4
"The dotting pens are so cute and helpful. The tapes are so thin I have a hard time using it but they're pretty durable, doesn't break off even though it's really thin. Worth the money.",5
I've used the skin obsession 15% and done really well. I decided to increase and purchased the 40% so I used it twice experienced little to no peeling???? I'm starting to think that this is not 40% because it doesn't work:( I was super excited when I recieved it but now I'm really unhappy because I've gotten no results from using it.,1
"I was initially disappointed when I opened the package ... the tool didn't have as much substance as some of the other buffers I've used.  I gave it try anyway and just like the other reviewer stated, I can't believe how shiney my nails are after less than two minutes of buffing.  There's no instructions, but you start with the darker colored side and work your way down to the lighter color.  I'm glad I bought extras to give as gifts.",5
"I've yet to have a dud from theBalm. The eyeshadows are highly pigmented and easy to blend. The blush and highlight are beautiful. So, far I haven't experimented too much with the lip product, but from what I have used of it I liked it. I think it might be a better cheek tint though as it's second usage.",5
"Great natural moisturizer. I love that it its very rich and goes on great. There is a lot of product in the jar so it will last a long time. I love the ingredients used in this face cream, very natural and simple. This face cream overall is an excellent cream to use. This is a great face moisturizer to use everyday, a very nice product!",5
"These dotting tools are easy to use and easy to clean. If you're just getting into nail art, these tools are a great way to get started.  They're incredibly easy to manage and will make you look like a professional!",5
"New to nail stamping I'd say this is &#34;ok&#34; to use.The stamper actually works really well for me compared to another I got from Hong Kong recently. But its too small and too hard. The scraper is metal and will scratch your plates, and I find the holder useless honestly.Right now I use this stamper with an old health card as my scraper and I don't use the holder at all.",3
"I like this color but was hoping for a few more sparkles. I was looking for the mermaid tail looking color and thought this was it, but I think it was big bang or something that I should have gotten. It is pretty but I wanted a little more green with sparkles.",4
"It is stretchy, comfortable, and looks great. Not at all fragile or sharp like it may appear. got lots of compliments",5
"These must be made for giants with very yellow skin. Seriously, the color of the stocking material is almost laughable its so yellow. Additionally, they are gigantic! I will not be purchasing again. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for!",2
"I have a short layered bob but my hair is super frizzy and dry. I also am sensitive to chemical heavy products and wanted something more natural.  I had been using Hair One cleansing conditioner and loved the way it made my hair feel but it wouldn't get out my hair product (hairspray, texture wax, etc)  I just tried this today on a whim and it is AMAZING!!! The coconut cowash made my hair feel very clean, it very easily removed style buildup and my hair felt so soft after like i had just deep conditioned but no residue or buildup!  It smells very good and feels like it would be good for any hair type.",5
"I liked this dryer ... UNTIL it sucked my hair in the back vent.  I currently use a Conair ionic Hair Dryer, which is very heavy ... but I really like it.  I thought I had found a lighter replacement with this hair dryer.  Unfortunately, I can't keep having my hair sucked into the back vent since it damages my hair, but usually needs to be cut to get the hair out.  This dryer would be great if that vent had some sort of cover to keep the hair out of the fan.",3
It's creamy and does a good job of lifting.  It's the only brand of developer that I trust to deliver consistent results.,5
"They are too small for my head and keep slipping off. But I have a friend with a really tiny head that uses these all the time, so it was worth it.",3
As I was planning a trip to Ireland I discovered that none of my flat irons had dual voltage. This was perfect and the price was great.It also works very well on my bob style haircut. I know that this will be a favorite flat iron even when I arrive back home from my trip. It's even better than my expensive flat irons from CHI and Hana Elite. Also all I need to be able to use it in Ireland is a&#34;G&#34; adapter plug.,5
"Got this for my wife who needed a new curling iron.  It works well and gets up to a good temperature to do its job.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't have the usual clip or bristles to hold the hair in place while it is curled - it comes with a small glove that you wear to protect your hand from the heat, and you simply wrap your hair around the wand that way.  My wife finds this a bit inconvenient and would prefer to either have a clip or bristles.But other than that it works just fine and she's fairly happy with it.",4
"I've tried several Toni&Guy; products and I really liked the shampoo and conditioner but as for the others such as this smoothing lotion, I just think they are an average product. What's so wrong with being an average product? At this price point, I expect more than average.The smoothing lotion has a light hold and light scent but it didn't seem to be all that conditioning.",3
"Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen sprays on cool and refreshingly, and does an excellent job of preventing sunburn. I burn very easily and have tried many products. I like this one because it goes on clean, isn't messy to apply and is effective. The coolness of the spray is nice and I really like the scent. Highly recommend.",5
"I usually have sensitive skin; one of the few scented products I can still use is body wash (probably because you rinse it off right after you apply it).  I don't really have issues with body acne, and never have, but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.  I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin, and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin's appearance (for example, by killing bacteria on the skin's surface).  First I tried the regular (orange-colored and unscented) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it didn't really do all that much for me.  The grapefruit wash was a different story.  In combination with some Amlactin body lotion, this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.I happen to like the fragrance, although I understand that's going to differ from person to person.  (If you want to know what your own reaction will be, go sniff some in a drugstore before buying!)  Because this does contain some plant extracts, colors, and fragrances, it may not be ideal for people who have reacted to other products with the same ingredients (listed below for reference):Active Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) (Acne Treatment)Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sodium C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Polyquaternium 7, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Roman Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carrageenan (Chondrus Crispus), Agar, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Propylene Glycol, C12 15 Alkyl Lactate, Polysorbate 20, Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzalkonium Chloride Solution, Sodium Benzotriazole Butylphenol Sulfonate, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Red 30 (CI 73360), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Violet 2, Mica, FragranceSome of the negative reviews have me puzzled.  While I don't dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid, I'd like to set the record straight about a couple of things.First, this is a body wash and should be treated as such.  This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it (and not leaving it on and letting it dry).  It is not a spray or a cream.  It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects (I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do).  It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.At any rate, I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case.  I will purchase more when my current bottle is used up.",5
"My boyfriend purchased this for me a while back, and I use it all the time. The colors are extremely pigmented, and last all day (with or without a primer) As a brunette, I am also able to use the matte tan shade to fill in my eyebrows. Totally worth it, and I will forever be a Coastal Scents gal.",5
This is really black. It is not brown or grey or light black. It is just black. The most disappointing thing about eye liner pencils is that you have to sharpen it from time to time. This one solves all the problem and the pencil is not so soft to break all the time. It gives you a nice outline around the eyes and the effects are wonderful.,5
"This scrub is really above the quality so far your surprise is not only unexpected but it isn't a reaction you would dream coming from anything that costs under $12.00. It exfoliates, cleanses and does really minimize your pores which believe it or not; most product that are ""pore minimizing,"" don't minimize at all. This one does! They took this off the shelves for a year about a year and a half ago and I was not happy! I am so glad they brought it back! Can't say enough good things about it. The pump dispenses the cleanser in a way that shows you how much you have left and doesn't go fast which happens a lot with the clear dispensing products.Smells great, feels great, no residue.",5
"This product does exactly what it's supposed to- it effectively encourages cell turnover and removes acne-creating dead skin cells, dirt, etc. I would suggest working your way up in usage (so basically once a day versus twice). I also found that it works wonders if used in conjunction with chemical peels. I've been using a 10% salicylic acid peel (which is oil soluble so it can break through the sebum; essentially the first layer) and afterwards I VERY gently dab Cellbone's Prep solution over my face. It has glycolic acid that is even MORE effective if the sebum is disinigrated as it is only water soluble (the layer below the sebum). My face peels quite shockingly for a few days but afterwards I have baby smooth skin that glows (my hyperpigmentation, cystic acne and fine wrinkles are radically diminished)!! I love this product and will buy it over and over again...plus, they include a great collagen face wash that I'm enjoying as a free gift =)",5
"Great cleansing shampoo for colored hair.  No sulfates.  Wonderful fresh scent.  I like the pump bottle, a little goes a long way.UPDATE:  I am disappointed, the price seems to be going up every time I order 'It's A 10'.  Ridiculous.  Just switched to Neutrogena Clean Volume shampoo.  Very happy and reasonably priced.",2
I just need acne treatment and this was large so I bought it.Pumping make it easier...and I like that.,4
"I've recently been using a lot of acetone to remove my nail polish and my GF recommended glycerine. I've decided to shop via Amazon since I don't want to drive around hunting for it. I've read the many reviews and I'm glad I bought this!!  I've tried many lotions (thick, thin types of lotions) during cold winters (30-60 degrees) to remedy my dry itchy skin. So far I've been using it right after my shower and my dry spot on my arm has disappeared. I've also used this on my hair and my face!! I have combination/oily skin, but it depends on the weather. During winter months its combination/oily with dry patches which causes my skin to break out because my skin is trying to find the natural oil balance and so my skin freaks out. I've tried so many products and none has done the job right. So far it has worked. I spritz it on after using my cleanser and toner and so far so good! I'm asian and I have long med/thick black hair. I wash with my shampoo, towel dry my hair, spritz away, and/or blow dry or air dry my hair. It feels so soft after using this. Also, I use this after painting/cleaning my nails to prevent dry cuticles, etc dry skin peeling. No problems, works great!!!(Spray mix: I use a 3oz spray bottle I found at Target. Fill 2/5th of the bottle with glycerin and the rest with water. You could do 1/3 glycerin but it's my first time using it and I rather do less to start off)",5
"i first received this perfume about 8 years ago as a present and found it to be a semi sweet,feminine but still light and refreshing scent.The purchase here on Amazon was no disappointment.Packaging was perfect,shipping fast and the cost very reasonable.",5
"I used to wear BareMinerals Medium Beige for a long time and it did help lessen break outs and keep my skin looking clear. I then tried the new matte version of B.M. and disliked it. It made my face look chalky and rested in my fine lines. I then switched to Silk Naturals brand and I used it the past 2 years. I recently bought B.M. at Sephora to try again and I was dissatisfied.Pros: I like the packaging, ease of washing off makeup, hardly any residue, keeps my skin clear & blemish free, light airy feel, natural ingredientsCons: I makes my face look oily on T-zone after 5 hours, does nothing for redness on my noseOverall: Silk Naturals is better, I can customize my shade, covers better & reduces redness, is all natural and doesn't make my face look oily even after I wear it 10 hours! It is slightly harder to wash off but that is ok since it has everything else I'm looking for.",4
This is a great product because it smells absolutely wonderful.  I use it when I want to air dry my hair for a natural curl usually for the first 2 months after a fresh perm.  It leaves my hair smelling so great!  I use a lot of heat on my hair otherwise so I use this product after a shampoo to protect.  I have to add a shine serum when blow drying because this product isn't going to add any kind of shine to my hair.  Sometimes I use just a tiny amount (and I do mean tiny) on dry hair to freshen up the smell of my hair and protect against the humidity.  My hair gets really frizzy when its humid but not when I have Cantu in it.  It's perfect for me!,5
"I am so angry with my purchase, I should have read more into it.The concealer is a glossy sticky substance.For some odd reason I thought it would be a powder mineral.Came to my house so late, all the way from shanghai !!!Ugh go to a different seller.",1
"This lotion is more slippery than substantial, so not for after-bath application. The smell is divine, the absorption easy and complete.But the surface emollient quality is, well, not so much.Five minutes after application, I was reaching for more.And five minutes after that, I was reaching for another product entirely.",3
Nice for price but kind cheap looking,2
The quality on these is SO bad. Horrible. First they wouldn't stick at all with the highest quality nail glue there is. It took my forever to get them to stick on my client's fingers. I was so embarrased. Then they had a big gap when the edges finally did stick. Garbage. Don't buy!!! Spend the money and get good quality white tips. Don't settle for this garbage.,1
"Soon I'll be sulfate and cone free! I will only be using certain shampoos so my hair doesn't get used to the same one over and over again. I will continue with this one for sure! And I also love soap nut shampoo, but right now I am using it for coloring my hair, and I do the rinse and repeat so its more drying, when I use it regularly and it is that drying then I'll have to use a conditioner or leave in with it. With this I don't have to use conditioner or leave in, and my hair has a lot of body which is really nice!!! I got the coconut one, I will be wanting to try others. I plan on using sulfate free in the winter and then sulfate stuff I still have in the summer to use it up. Then when all the sulfate stuff is used up, I'll be using these sulfate free shampoos. I take showers everyday, but I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days, depends on how greasy my hair gets and where I'm going. My hair is so soft and I love touching it! I'm wanting to try out all the shampoos to see if I get the same results!",5
"I had the luxury of trying out the Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask for myself and I was very impressed. I've never used a mud mask before so I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. Since I'm a busy mom of 2 children with hardly any time for myself, I decided to wait until the evening when I was going to soak in the tub to do my mask so I could thoroughly relax and just feel it out. Now I'll be honest, the mud mask stinks! I'm not too fond of the smell at all; BUT before you run off with that statement, it's just a &#34;dirty mud&#34; type smell. Nothing terrible that will leave you gagging. With that being said, the mask itself honestly felt GREAT on my face. It was a unique feeling as it sat on my face after the application. While it smelled unpleasant, I just felt like I was in my own little world relaxing. After the day I had with my cranky teething infant, it's definitely what I needed. It applied to my face smoothly and when it was time to come off it wiped away very easily and effortlessly. I allowed it to sit on my face for the full time limit 15-20 minutes. It didn't dry up or get sticky. It stayed the same texture as I applied it: soft & smooth. When all was said and done my face felt so fresh and soft - it was amazing. Because I'm not fond of the mud smell, I used my regular facial wash after to disguise the scent, which seemed to work pretty well. While the smell is far from attractive, it's not bad enough to keep me from using this product again. In fact, it says to use weekly for best results, but on nights I want to unwind and relax I'll be using it as well. So on a nightly basis for me! I'm just amazed at how soft my face is - it feels like a baby! I highly recommend the Barefaced Dead Sea Mud Mask; particularly if you're a stressed out parent in need of some relaxing TLC!",5
Bought this for my son who is 11. My  esthetician recommended his product. Easy to use and love how it foams up. Easy to use and wash off. Smell is good too.,5
"I've only used this for two days, so these are first impressions. Since I'm a Vine reviewer, this was given to me, and I had sort of a 'what the heck' attitude about it, in that I'm a guy and I can't stand oily/creamy lotions.And whatever this stuff is, it sure isn't that. When I first squeezed it out onto my fingers, I noticed a definite scent. I can't really describe it, as it was a little medicinal, a little herbal. I was pretty neutral about it, except that I didn't want to smell it all day long. However, it pretty much disappears after a few minutes.The cream looks like lotion and feels like it at first, but more... watery... than lotion. It goes on easily and there's no sensation of oil at all.There are two things I really like about it:1) It disappears into the skin and leaves no sense of residue. Normally, any type of product I apply with my fingers requires that I wash my hands to get it off of them, but this stuff just disappears, leaving my fingers feeling a little smoother, almost as though I'd very gently washed them with a gritty cleanser. And there is the very slightest scent left, and it's nice.2) My face feels smoother, but it neither looks nor feels as though there's anything applied to it. It's really nice and I found myself thinking ""Ahhhh. so this is what high-end stuff feels like.""  (At the time I write this a 1.7 oz tube is about $53 on amazon.) And my face 'felt nice' during the day, though I'm not sure I'd have noticed if I weren't paying attention.If there's any negative it's price. Not just the cost, but this isn't one of those ""a very little will go a very long way"" types of things. I can take a very small amount of something oily and spread it out a lot. This isn't oily which is great, but the flip side is that it's not going to be cheap to use.Will I purchase more when this runs out? I tend to think not, given the price, but I'll see how things seem after a month (and will update this).",4
Yesterday I shaved with a different product that had a mild odor. Today I can say the same for this Dove. Glad to know that not all products for men have the horrible and repulsive scent that seems to be common these days in many other brands. This Dove has a mild and pleasant aroma. It does an excellent job of softening the beard to produce a smooth shave. Just a little portion of this gel will foam up enough to cover the entire shaving area. This product is an excellent shaving aid.,5
This is perfect if you like to design your nails. An absolute must to have in your nail decorating kit.,5
Great tools and accents. Easy to use and was pleasantly surprised by how nice everything was. Great buy and very fun.,5
"I got these on black Friday, assuming to get some random colors or sizes, but I actually got 9 pcs, assorted sizes, the small are great for my purse, but keep in mind each size has 3 different textures, I keep the pink in purse, since its smooth, and I used it a finishing file. Each file has its own pouch, all 9 came with a same size pouch.  So far I have used most of them, the texture is pretty solid, doesn't seem like the file need to be replaced soon, I already gave the blue and green of the big one to my mom and sister so when I hear from them I will update my post. I'm glad I made this purchase, there was many of them on Amazon, from many lovely brands, but since I bought everything from shany, I decide to give it a shot on this buffers too. Which turned out a good purchase, I actually think I made the best purchase, since I bought them at $10, and it almost cost me a $1 for each, I see all others are costing at least $2 each. I have started my DIY nails since last year, and the only thing was missing in my drawer was the glass nail file. Would recommend to friends.",5
I love this it is so easy to use and for the most part mess free.  I love how it getss little as possible on my fingers so I dont have to worry with my kids and it gettting in their mouth after being on my fingers b:),4
"with all the great reviews i wanted to love this. but it broke me out so terribly. i probably has 7 zits on my face after 2 weeks. Big Ones. Sorry, can't recommend.",1
"This shampoo has a strong coconut scent which I find really unpleasant. It didn't lather well and left my hair limp and feeling like it wasn't clean.  I have very thin, fine hair and this shampoo which is supposed to remove and clean build-up felt like it left more behind than it washed out.  My hair is very oily and I have to wash it every day, I did not feel as if my hair got thoroughly clean with this. I have to say I did not like it and would not buy it.",3
"This moisturizer goes on easily, doesn't feel greasy, and really does have a cooling effect.  My wife likes to put the jar in the fridge and use it before we go outside.  Says it helps keep her hydrated.  Also, important to her is that it has just a hint of scent to it and doesn't affect her sensitive skin.  Olay makes excellent skin care products and this is one of them.",4
"This is the best mascara I've ever tried.  And I've tried a lot.  I love the brush, this mascara goes on smooth every time and I never never never have clumps.  Not even at the end of the tube.  Lashes feel soft and look so natural!  LOVE this mascara!!!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something new.",5
"In general, I like Olay's new products.  I could never find out how this product would work for me over the long haul, since the overpowering fragrance makes my eyes swell, and exacerbates my asthma.  If you have allegies or sensitivities, I'd recommending passing on this one, or waiting for a fragrance-free product.",2
"I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague and I know that it is much safer to fake and bake with lotion....I have used a few different self tanners throughout the years (the cheap ones and the more high end) and I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color, For All Skin Tones for the past year and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin... it gives me a tan where I look like I am Brazilian vs. IrishI did venture out because I had heard such great things about the ""Fake and Bake"" brand and heck the price was right at $13.30 a bottle regularly $42.74 a bottle (Yikes). At any rate, foolish me.... I tried ""Fake and Bake""  and what a mistake!!When I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed. I did the the proper prep work IE moisturize, moisturize, moisturize a few days prior... Shower, exfoliate, shave, completely dry off, put my hair up and apply with the gloves.HOLY HECK that stuff was messy and dark, it actually scared me to the point I had to call my husband in to help me apply it as quick as possible. His exact words were ""honey this stuff is a nightmare, I sure hope you don't wake up disappointed and looking like a train wreck And I think that you need to stick with your Banana Boat""The dry time took Forrreverrrr with ""Fake and Bake"" too and when I was finally able to go to bed, I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower. When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower. - What a waste of time and money... No one has time for that!Lesson well learned.... Stick with what you know works and don't try to recreate the wheel!More about Banana Boat - Bedtime is the best time to apply...Banana Boat works well on my face too, pull your hair back and apply a dime size and let dry. I always moisturize on my off days and then I shower, shave, exfoliate, dry off really well and apply (rub in well) and let dry for 10 mins. Once dry get ready for bed and go to sleep, 6-8 hours later... shower off - it takes two-three separate applications to see a really nice Golden tan but you know it is working after the 6 hour mark from 1st application. Keep in mind... Slow and Steady Wins the Race with this stuff, but once you're there... You will be VERY happy :)Once I have a really nice tan -  I use this product faithfully every other night IE. Monday, Wednesday, Friday taking the other nights off to moisturize and exfoliate to avoid build up etc.I ALWAYS apply it at bed time so it sets in longer and avoid any smell in public. And I always shower, shave and exfoliate BEFORE applying. ALSO.... if you are not going to use gloves... wash hands in-between applying, I always start with the top half of my body (wash hands / dry) and finish with my lower half(wash hands / dry) and apply a small dime size on your wrist and work in putting your two wrist together and gliding it across your top hands etc until dry. - this helps with evening your tan out.You really cannot go wrong once you figure out what works best for you and the price cannot be beat considering this self-tanning lotion offers the same quality tan that other high end self-tanners do, but better!Best of Luck,~ SkyLee :)",5
"I've been on a mission to clear up my skin; combination/oily, photosensitive, sensitive, acne prone, aging (30's), etc...It's been a b* to tame over the last near two decades. Thankfully, someone got the bright idea to create mattifying creams, lotions, and gels to assist in combating excess oil, which makes my mission a little easier. I purchased this one because in comparison to others you get more bang for the buck (most on the market are a small $ for 1oz or less). This one you get more product at a great price point, and a little goes a very long way. I've not experienced abnormal or excessive breaking out since I've been using it. Keeps me matte for a few extra hours. I wash and tone and apply this after. It's white, light and absorbs quickly into the skin. Other moisturizers leave me greasy and wondering why I bothered to wash my face. This one literally zaps the oil and doesn't leave my skin feeling too tight. The smell seems to be a huge issue with this product. Personally, I don't mind the smell, but that's subjective. From what I can gather it is the bamboo ""essence"" causing the peculiar or notable odor. The bamboo is the mattifying ingredient according to the Formula website. At least that is what it smells like to me; bamboo-esk. The smell doesn't seem to linger regardless. Course, given the amount of time and money I've put into my skin trying to get it balanced and acne free, I'd just about rub essence of skunk on it so long as it worked. My biggest complaint about the product is it lacks spf. I want a mattifying sunscreen but they are impossible to find or ridiculously expensive. If this had a 30+ spf with it, it would be perfect. So at times I have to apply sunblock over the product during the day because I am so fair. Everyone should consider wearing spf regularly, especially on the delicate skin of the face, ears, and neck. At night I use alone, and wake with a nice dewy complexion (not dry or slick).",4
"I am impressed that when I ran out of the conditioner, that I could use the shampoo and not have tangles!  I have thick curly hair.  I like it.  I did notice a very strong alcohol smell.  It has lots of alcohol in it.  I dont like that and alcohol really dries and permanently damages your hair.  Also, I am concerned about what is the unnatural ingredients, because it is 99. something % natural.  I know that Burt's Bees toothpaste contains SACCHARINE!!!!!!!  So does most toothpaste and that is the very reason that I use Tom's of Maine.  But with all of these &#34;natural&#34; products you really have to watch!!!!! Because they are not 100%!!!!  User beware!!!!!!!",4
"Looks ok from far away,  but a bit cheap when up close. Holds hair up nicely, though keeps it up.",3
"I love Deva Curl products like nobody's business! I highly recommend all of their product, it's the only stuff I use!",5
"I was really looking forward to this product!!! I ran home after work to retrieve it but when I opened it I was shocked!!! Glitter everywhere!!! Most of the pots were only half full and all the colors had mixed together!!! If the seller can remedy this I would give 5&#11088;'S!!! The glitters would have been gorgeous if they weren't all mixed together... And though the pots are small you should be able to  get many uses out of it (if the pots aren't empty). Also- shipping time was decent.. Please remedy this!!update- the company refused to replace my product, but offered full refund.. for this i have changed my rating to 3 stars! wish i could have gotten a replacement really liked the product..",3
"I really liked how easy this product was to put on and how light weight it felt on my skin. It really didn't leave any kind of residue, at all. I've only been using this product for a little more than a week, but I can already feel and see a difference. My face feels smoother, brighter and even a little firmer. I have really sensitive skin and is prone to breakouts, so I am always a little hesitant to try new things... but, I am happy to say that it had no negative effects on my skin. It also seem to reduce my pore size, fine lines and it has definitely evened out my skin tone! Overall, I am pretty pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.",5
"I have light skin and dark hair. This product's shade is 'mine but better' of my own lip color. It's an enhanced nude (for those who want something just a touch richer than your natural lip shade). The coverage is opaque, but the shade is awesome, feels great, lasts longer than a gloss, and leaves my lips soft.Have you ever seen the makeovers using neutral shades that just enhance the subjects beauty, and gives them a polished look without too much color? This is that shade. That said, the shine can hold it's own with a smoky eye and lashes, so it works with a lot if looks, evidenced by my going through three tubes.My previous go to was Revlon lipstick in soft rose, and this is slightly nude-er.If I apply in the morning, I can usually get through to lunch before I *need* to reapply. It wears almost as long as traditional lipstick.  Since it doesn't leave me over dry, I don't realize it's due for a touch up until I take a look at it. It's very comfortable to wear.",5
I have combination skin and this just seemed to make my foundation melt right off my face and leaves my skin looking splotchy and greasy.  I think this texture would be great for anyone with dry or normal skin as it is very silky when you first out it on.,2
"Took some getting use to, but once I did I really liked it. Invigorating and does wonders for the skin!",5
"I can't say my thighs need any help as they are pretty good already but what does need help is the area around the outside of my hips and sides of my waist. This feels amazing. I use it with just some jojoba oil or sweet almond oil as a massage oil. You do have to use some pressure on this to feel it but it feels fantastic. These are little plastic rollers that somehow really dig in through the skin to the tissues underneath to smooth out the lumps and muscle knots.I have sore shoulders on top that need a good regular massage and this feels amazing used on them. I also experience various aches and pains from exercising and this instantly relieves the tension. I didn't see how this could work when I looked at but with some pressure on it, those little rollerballs push and smooth the underlying bumps and knots away.This also is a great way to give a massage to a partner. You can really dig this in as it rolls across the skin and smooth out tight muscles in a way nothing else can. I haven't used this long enough to comment on if it helps my cellulite but this uses the principal of breaking up the fat deposits under the skin by pushing and kneading them and encouraging them to smooth out. A shower or steam room to open the pores at the same time you use this would increase the benefits.This is a smoothing deep tissue massage that gets at the fat right under the skin where it forms cellulite. Combined with exercise and drinking lots of water, this not only soothes sore aching muscles but probably breaks down lumpy fat deposits. My friend said the key to using this is to use it every day right after exercise. She is incredible looking and knows the secrets of taking care of herself, more than anyone I've ever seen. If she says it works, I believe her. She is a personal coach and trainer, and I follow every word of her advise. I will continue to use this, and recommend it for anyone who not only wants a great feeling massage but has some issues with cellulite they want to get rid of. My friend with an amazing body swears by it. *I was provided with a free sample.",5
"It really is amazing to me that this product is being sold with this ""trigger"". Its completely awful. It's barely manageable, but if your hands are even the least bit wet, forget it. You will not get it in your hair, but rather your eyes and clothes...anywhere but your hair.That said, I really like the product itself.  The smell is not overpowering, and I am pretty sensitive to smells - this one doesn't bother me at all. It is a protectant, something to put on before blow-drying. It is not a gel or mousse or anything to give your hair structure, which is a plus because it isn't sticky at all.  Just a nice smelling product to put on before blow drying to give your hair some protection from the heat.I really do like this product, even thinking about putting it in my own spray bottle.  The nozzle has to go!",5
"this is such a lightweight yet such a moisturizing moisturizer!!!!! I really recommend this to those who have oily and acne prone skin, this really moisturizes your face and keeps it dewy and healthy! In the wintertime I went up into the mountains for a retreat with my church and I brought this body shop face moisturizer/primer because I knew that it was going to be dry and my face would be horribly dry and flaky. The body shop moisturizer actually made things worse and dried out my skin, I would literally press my face against some dark colored cloth, and my skin would flake everywhere, it was disgusting and horrible and I just wanted to go home. The dryness caused me to break out 10x more than I would ( i have a big acne problem) I would exfoliate, but it'd make things worse, because i had nothing to moisturize after with. I looked this up on amazon and saw the good reviews and decided to purchase it at a nearby target. Literally when I applied this, in one night my face was moisturized, not as flaky (it was still healing from when I came down from the mountains) and my face felt good and not dry and rough and nasty blegh. I'm out of my first one from in December when I bought it, and now ordered and received my second one. I am sooo happy with this moisturizer, it's very light and smells nice and feels really cool and refreshing and its just all around amazing!! Definitely recommend for an inexpensive yet really good moisturizer. It's GEL not a CREAM so it's really good for oily and acne prone skin, cream can clog up pores and make acne worse. The only con..not really a con, is that it's surprisingly small ahaha i expected a bigger container, but it holds a lot and I use this on a daily basis morning, noon, night, whenever i wash my face! The container is made of thick glass, so try not to drop it! A definite recommend and definite buy!",5
"I know it seems very enticing to buy a face peel, and use it at home without having to go to the derm. I bought this and used it and insanely regret my decision. I've had acne since I was 13. I've used tons of things, and surprisingly as bad as my acne got I never scarred. Sure I got hyperpigmentation but I never had dents and pits left in my face from them. And for that I was already very grateful for. I am always searching for way to get rid of hyperpigmentation. I've looked up facial peels before and at the time it seemed like a good idea. Lots of people have done it, it seems to help, so I decided to try it. If i never scarred before, I was scarring now. This stuff is no joke. YOU CANNOT USE ON ACTIVE BREAKOUTS. I was very careful in the beginning. It said to leave it on for only a little time and then increase the time. I followed this to the t. And I started noticing pits in my face where active acne was. Even a little white head would leave a scar. I would sincerely recommend everyone to steer of this product. I would not call my skin sensitive, I've used retinoids before, I've used harsh acne treatments, but this stuff is very harsh. I would be very very careful.",2
I DNT C WHERE IT IS WRKIN I HV BEEN USING 4 A WEEK NOW I WILL KEEP USING 2 C IT HAD GRT REVIEWS BUT I DNT C IT,3
"I use this about once a week. When I use this, I like to mix some of my aloe vera juice and witch hazel in with some distilled water. It's definitely will firm your skin, but is strong. Would not recommend this for someone with sensitive skin at all.",5
Blotting papers. They work if you need blotting papers. My son has an oily forehead and these work great to control the grease. I chose this brand because there are no additives to the paper! Who would think blotting papers would be anything but paper - but many of them have chemicals added. So if you're looking for just paper - this is it.,5
Well this is a terrific product. Loved it.,3
seems to work very well but unfortunately i cant enjoy the benefits as it burns and itches my eyes. =-O  ill stick with the amazingly effective and affordable select lash!,3
"I really like the GlamGlow face mask, so I was very excited to try this eye treatment.  However, I was disappointed by how much it burned on application.  I understand there is mild tingling expected as the active ingredients do their job, but I am nervous to try this again.  I try to be very gentle with the skin around my eyes, and this was too harsh.  I think I'll just stick to the mask.",2
"This very black mascara goes on thick but not clumpy, stays on all day without smearing and washes off relatively easy.  Since the applicator brush is shaped like a thick hourglass (tapered in the middle), it requires a steady hand to apply the mascara to the inside lashes. I would have liked the tip of the brush to be tapered so that I could define my inside lashes better without being concerned I'm going to smear mascara on the inside portion of the eyelid or upper cheek.Unlike most of the other reviewers, I liked this mascara a lot. When I applied it to my lashes, it went on thick without clumping. It also did not smear when I wore it all day (like some other mascaras I've tried). I'll be wearing it all day every weekday until this tube runs out so if that changes, I'll update my review.Other than the fat tipped brush that makes the mascara difficult to apply to the inside lashes, to me this mascara is great.UPDATE 12/5/13: I've been using this mascara for almost a week and it hasn't smudged even though I wear it about 15-16 hours daily. I do like the mascara but I really dislike the thick brush.  If the brush were more tapered, it would be one of several mascaras I would consider purchasing.",4
This is my favorite lipstick in my favorite color.  I bought a couple at an excellent price and am preparing to reorder.,5
"I was so excited to purchase this because I had been wanting to do nail stamping for quite some time. I had read previous reviews so I knew there was the possibility that all the plates may not work. I was disappointed to find out that some of the plates that didn't work well were the ones that  had caught my eye and made me purchase this set. Price is excellent compared to Konad brand plates, but I feel the quality suffers because of this. I would purchase from Bundle Monster again.",3
"This is a great, everyday shampoo. I have fine hair and I find that it leaves it soft and shiny, without weighing it down. And it's got a great scent. I would definitely recommend this product. It's worth it.",5
"As I reach the last third of this product in the bottle I have noticed the odor is quite unpleasant and am very hesitant to use it at all. I was not that impressed with this product, anyway. It's strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample. I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products. I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product.",3
"I have a sister and several friends that swear by the Bare Minerals make up, and I was dying to try it - I just didn't want to pay that much for something I might not like.  When I saw this set on Amazon, I thought, well, that is much less than the name brand one and you get everything you need.  So, I went ahead and ordered it.  It arrived while my sister was here and we had to check it out.I have to say that I am very impressed with this make up set.Not only does it cover everything well, the set comes with everything you could need to match to your face flawlessly.  The concealer worked wonderfully under the eyes and on the few blemishes I have on my skin.  You cannot tell that they were ever there!  I have very light skin being a natural redhead, and there were two different ""Fair"" foundations in the set I ordered.  While the lighter one was too light and the darker one was a bit dark, I found that I could easily mix them a bit and blend the perfect shade for me.  It covers extremely well, and is so lightweight that I really cannot tell I'm wearing any make up at all.  There are two different colors of blush in this set, a sparkly pink one called ""Baby Face"" and a darker one as well.  We tried them both - and both look beautiful!  Cover with the mineral veil finisher and your face looks amazing!!  There are also three small eyeshadows that come with this set as well and they are all beautiful on.For any lady out there that is considering purchasing the more expensive brand name set, I would recommend that you try this one first.  Even my sister, who wears the other one, was extremely impressed and even a bit mad when I told her how much less I paid for it.

"This set is much better than the 1st Pueen set. I fell in love with the design of this set, it's very elegant and just beautiful. They stamp really good and no more pesky half moon curve. They are all full nails which I love! Overall I'm very happy with it! Well done!",5
this is not what I expected; thought it would blow air out through the wand but it just gets hot; works well but it's just ok.,3
"The different heads snap on easily.  It heats up very quickly.  The flattener works well.  The curler is ok.  The volumizer is questionable.  I thought it was ok.  Separate products for each task are probably better... The convenience of this product definitely results in compromises.  Overall though, I like it!",3
"I originally bought this product because it is supposed to help dry and damaged hair.  It may but it is NOT designed for fine hair.To use it, you emulsify it in your hands until it becomes an oil and then you apply it to your hair. The problem is that it wouldn't wash out of my hair.  My hair felt sticky and greasy even after a straight week of washing twice a day. Ojon just weighed it down and I didn't notice a difference in conditioning at all.It also has a weird smell. I've noticed that people either hate it or love it but I HATE the smell of Ojon.  I'd hard to describe the scent but it smells disgusting.",1
"We're all familiar with often used grading standards - A down to F, Excellent dropping to Poor, and Better or Best. I'm happy to say that this T3 Bespoke Labs Featherweight Dryer rates a solid A, an underlined Excellent,and with no doubt a Best from me.It dries my hair in half the time it took other dryers, and leaves it shiny, sleek - no more fly-away strands.As my hair is fine I also use T3 360 Plump for added fullness. Simply spray on towel dried hair and work through with a wide tooth comb. There's nothing like it! Totally non-sticky Plump gives me amazing volume as well as sun protection.T3 is tops!",4
"I have very dark hair & brows. This matches perfectly with the correct pressure. Blends nicely w the brush. Lasts all day, not smearing. An excellent product!",5
This seems to be working well on my skin.  The cleanser is good and the skin looks polished and smooth.  I will be buying refills.,5
"(Review for yellow, citrus packet) I was really surprised that these clean the way they do. The 'wipes' are thin sheets, with no bumps to offer any scrubbing action. I was very skeptical but it does work. A single sheet can clean my oily face, heavy foundation and eye liner. And as advertised, no rinsing required. It doesn't leave skin too dry the way most cleansers do. Love the light, citrus scent. The packet reseals itself once opened, so a great option to take on trips.",4
"This dye turned my hair black, not brown. It was much darker than the color on the box. After it faded it was a pretty dark brown shade but that took some time.",3
"They are very pretty and of good quailty. With care, they will last a very long time. They are a larger size, best for me on Thunb nail. I recommend these.",5
"This product contains retinol which is the most amazing acne fighting ingredient around.  I was noticing some fine lines around my mouth and forehead and I have been struggling with monthly hormonal breakouts on my cheeks and chin ever since I had my daughter three years ago.  Within the first week my skin cleared up and after about 6 weeks I am noticing those fine lines beginning to soften. All in all, my skin looks better.  Its clearer, smoother and the tone is even.  Do beware, this product contains AHA's which can wreak havoc on sensitive skin, if you notice redness stop using, you are having a reaction and your skin will not adjust (skin doesn't work like that)But if you respond well, this cream may be your new favorite, especially if you suffer from the occasional breakout.",5
"I'm skeptical of claims by cosmetics companies, but I do like Neutrogena products as a rule. I can't say this product makes me look significantly younger, but I didn't expect that. It does, however, feel really good, and it makes my skin look smooth in the morning. This moisturizer is more of a lotion than a cream, so a little goes a long way. That's a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't feel greasy going on my face. It's absorbed quickly and doesn't stain my pillow. It's lightly scented - I don't even notice the scent. It feels really good after I have put it on, and I don't wake up with a compelling urge to wash the stuff off of my face. My face looks smooth and feels soft in the morning. This moisturizer does not have SPF, so it would not be appropriate as a day cream. I don't know that this product is any better than night creams by the major cosmetics companies like Lancome and Estee Lauder, but I'd be willing to bet it's a lot less expensive. I think I'll keep using this. It feels good and works well.",5
"I like the Suave shampoos. I admit I know next to nothing about the subject, so keep that in mind when evaluating my opinion here. I like them mostly because they are affordable and smell good, which are about the only variables I'm qualified to appraise. I have short, low maintenance hair, even by male standards. I've been using this shampoo for a week or two now and I feel like it works well. Then again, I have dandruff, but that predates the shampoo change and is mostly because it's winter. Whether it has anything to do with my shampoo choices, I'm not sure nor am I particularly worried about it. But I really do like the scent. It's grassy, with hints of bamboo and general planty-ness. It's fresh and reminds me every morning of a freshly mowed lawn in summer, which I tend to miss around this time of year (late January in Central New York). I might add this one to one of the regular ones I reach for when I run out.",4
"Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer SPF50 - The manufacturer's claim that this is an ultralight liquid certainly holds true.  Despite the SPF50, this moisturizer does not feel heavy, and does not clog pores. It keeps the dry patches on my face moisturized all day, yet oily patches don't turn into a greasy mess.  I have sensitive skin with some rosacea, and this moisturizer does not irritate at all.  It provides a nice base, and my liquid foundation goes on smoothly over this moisturizer.  The first day I wore this, I actually received a compliment from a co-worker on how nice I looked, but she couldn't put her finger on exactly what was different.  The biggest test of the SPF quality is my one-hour commute to work each day, in a sunny climate.  Since I normally wear SPF30 daily, I can say that as a sunscreen, this moisturizer works just as well as any SPF30 I've used in the past.  I have not put it to the challenge of longer periods in full sun, so can't really comment on how well it performs as SPF50.  I normally avoid chemical sunscreens, but after giving this one a try, I find myself reaching for it every morning before applying my foundation.  Although I received this via the Amazon Vine program, I intend to purchase more when when I run out.",5
I'm only giving them 1 star because they are not for nails. They aren't curved so basically if you put them on your nails the edges of the bow will be up and can easily snag on things and it will come right off. There so cute tho so I'm probably just gonna put them on my phone or something. There really small would have been perfect for nails if they were curved. Some of the rhinestones were off the bow when I got them but its a simple fix if you have nail glue. They came within 2 weeks of ordering so that was cool. Wouldn't recommend if your buying them for nails.,1

"I have acne prone skin and I am 30. I have years of damage to my face and use a lot of make-up to cover uneven tone, scars and blemishes. I use it between my peels. I have notice my pores are not as clogged after I started using the skin cleaner. I love the refreshing feel it leaves me from the eucalyptus. It also leaves my face very soft after. My mother-in-law has tried about everything under the sun and was quickly drawn to this product. I let her try it and she was very impressed. I will buy more from Infinite Skin again. I would like to try some other products.",5
"I first received Chanel No 5 as a Valentine's Day Gift from my then boyfriend now husband, I figured any one with such great taste in perfume was the guy for me. That was thirty years ago. I loved the classic scent then and I still wear it today.I spray Chanel No 5 on in the morning and  the scent remains throughout the day.And the bottle, I just love the bottle it is a work of art, elegant and simple.",5
"I have never liked liquid shower soaps.  Always been a bar soap man.  I don't like liquid shower soaps because they usually smell like flowers, or fruits and vegetables, they typically lather very poorly unless you use one of those little net scrubby things, and they leave your skin feeling slimey.I was genuinely intrigued when I saw this product.  Nivea has a good reputation for skin products for men, so I thought I would take a chance.  The result is that I actually enjoy using this soap.  I may not use it every day, but I could see myself using it most of the time.I think it smells great.  It leaves a very subtle masculine scent on your skin.  My wife very much likes the scent.  It's not too overpowering like you've been marinating in it.  Just enough to improve the air that you walk though.  When you're washing with it, it almost has a menthol quality about it that I guess could be invigorating for some people.  The scent it leaves behind does not smell like menthol, however.I think it cleans well and leaves a not-so-slimey finish.  I don't feel like I need to rinse off for an hour after using it.  I think it also lathers rather well without using anything to generate bubbles.My only concern is that I have to use a palm full to lather my whole body.  The bottle is pretty big, but I have a feeling this bottle will last me 2-3 weeks.If you have never been a fan of liquid shower soap and are curious about this product, you should probably buy a smaller portion locally, and if you like it then order the multi pack from Amazon.",4
"Took 3 weeks to get them and one was broken right out of the package. Also, they were angled which was not portrayed in the picture or in the description. You get what you pay for.",1
"I have long, thick hair.  It all fits into this cap comfortably.  I would buy again.",5
"Having straight, silky hair is hard to come by. I've been searching for the perfect flat-iron for my hair. I am an African-American woman without a chemical straightener in my hair. So getting my hair super straight is always a challenge. I was hesitant about using the Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron. My first concern was that it wouldn't get hot enough to straighten my hair. I was so wrong. The Remington S7230 gets super hot! For once I don't have to have the temp on the highest setting in order to achieve the amount of heat that I need.I also tried the Wet 2 Dry. It dried my hair and got it just as straight as if I was using it on dry hair. The sound of my hair sizzling was a little disconcerting but I didn't smell burning hair. It took about 5 passes through 1 section of hair to get it dry. My hair is jaw-length and not that thick. I think those with longer, thicker hair, it would take longer for a section to dry.Overall I love this flat iron and I use it daily.",4
This product advertises visible difference in one week.  I have tried for eight weeks now and although there may be some difference it is not noticeable to me.  I do like the product and the feel on your face.  Just don't expect too much of a difference in skin texture - luckily mine is not too bad to begin with!,1
"Who's been described as ""Bold. Glamorous. Full Frontal Sexy""? Kimora Lee Simmons, of course. She's also an uber-babe who has turned the once dull tiny T-shirt Baby Phat line into a very contemporary array of styles worn by the hip and hope-to-be. Now, has introduced her first fragrance, an extension of the Baby Phat line, called Baby Phat Goddess.As unique as the woman herself, Baby Phat Goddess is a rich floral bouquet with op notes of pure gardenia, white rosebuds and cedrat flower. Now, what's sweet without sophistication? For that, there's a tad of black pepper.You know the bottle has to be something special, and it is - faceted and modeled after her rare Asscher cut diamond, complete with a faux diamond ring around the neck of the bottle.An impressive gift, although definitely not for Auntie Em.",5
"I like the performance of the flat iron, it smoothes the hair, which is important. My cheaper Remington frizz control was a mess, making my hair frizzy and static.This flat iron is lightweight but too bulky for me, I prefer more flat style like GHD one. It is slightly too long. There is a temperature control if someone needs it, I actually prefer 1 temperature set.Overall if the Panasonic would work on the appearance and make it look more modern and professional it would be great product. I someone doesn't care about the looks than it is great for straightening.",3
"I love this stuff- it's pricey but it's definitely worth it. This works better than any exfoliating scrub, loofah, glove, or cloth I've ever tried. After the first use, I noticed that my skin looked clearer. The skin on my arms and legs can get blotchy and bumpy but after using this my skin was clear and healthy looking. My shoulders were smooth and my skin was glowing. I didn't even know my skin was that bad until I used this and saw the difference. It contains almost 9% glycolic acid but didn't irritate my skin at all, although I don't use it daily... I use it every other day. I definitely recommend using a cheap body wash to cleanse the oils off of your body before using this because the Glytone body wash lathers much better on skin that is already clean, so wash your body with a different body wash first to save yourself some product and money. Another piece of advice: leave it on your skin for about 3 minutes before washing it off. Doing this, I found that I don't even need the lotion, this body wash works well on its own for me. My skin looks so smooth and even and glowing- I feel like I'm ready for the red carpet! Will definitely repurchase.",5
Gives the hair gloss and healthier ............ i use amla avery 2 week he make nice hair for me .,5
I had no problems with this product whatsoever.  I followed the directions and my hair was revived and smelled nice.,5
"This truly is a deluxe model of a shampoo brush. Using silicone rather than hard, scratchyplasticfor the massage tips is a terrific idea. It is much more comfortable against the skin. This product also works great as a hairbrush for men, or for women and children with short hair.This little device is not only excellent for massaging the scalp. It also functions wonderfully to provide stimulation to the skin anywhere you can reach with it, particularly the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. There are two schools of thought regarding stimulating the skin and connective tissue just beneath it that inspired me to use this particular implement in that way. The first isdry-skin brushing, which uses a natural, vegetable-derived, somewhat-stiffbrushto stimulate the skin of the body. The second isThe MELT Method, which uses small, firmballsto massage the hands and feet. I tried a mixture of the principles of both, using this brush from head to toe, and I prefer it to either dry brushing or the MELT technique with balls. In particular, the sensation of rubbing it over the palm of the hands creates an immediate sense of relaxation and well-being.By the way, this is not the only brand of this particular style of massage/shampoo brush. There are several others sold here on Amazon that are almost identical to this one, including those made byKentandBabyliss.",5
"I've been looking for I something like this for several years now; the Avon eyeshadow I needed to replace had sadly been discontinued.  I've searched hi and low for a nice thick frosty pink eyeshadow like this that comes with its own wand for easy application.  In the meantime, I was stuck with other cream based shadows that weren't the right shade, and not thick and bold enough to be noticeable.  Luckily, I was on the lookout for an eyelash curler at Target, and there this eyeshadow was hanging right beside it.  I couldn't believe I may have found a great shadow at such a low price.  I'm not going to admit how much I spent at Ulta and other stores trying to find this!  I wore it for the first time today and it has excellent coverage, the color definitely noticeable, a frosty lighter shade of pink which contrasts nicely with green eyes like mine.  I didn't have any burning sensation as others mentioned, if you're like me and don't have a history of sensitive skin you'll probably be just fine.  The color did crease a little in the crease of my lid but not until I'd been wearing it for almost 10 hours.  I was surprised to see on Amazon this is waterproof because nothing on the packaging says that this product is waterproof. You would think that they would advertise that if it was.  I have not tested the waterproof capability yet, that's a minor issue for me.  I am in love with this product and will definitely stock up on it!",5
"This was my first use of this type of product to cover graying hair.  I could not have hoped for better results.  The process is messy, but worth the beautiful rich color this product provides.",5
"Works as expected. The color won't turn matte immediately; you have to let it sit for a minute. Definitely use at least two coats of polish before applying. This top coat definitely thins the polish when you apply it, so if you don't have multiple coats it will strip the color too thin and your natural nail will show through. Otherall very happy. Much cheaper than spending money on individual matte colors.",4
"I must admit, I wasn't expecting actual thin masks that would be draped onto my face. I guess I didn't read the ""10 pcs"" part on the box. These masks were very wet, dripping really. I ended up squeezing some of the liquid out before I draped it across my face, because otherwise, they dripped and ran down my neck. And they're big! They swallowed my little face and I had to keep adjusting them. Other than that, the pearl powder facial mask cools the skin when you wear it. My face had a light glow after using it. They give a refreshing feeling without all the fuss, well, on my part, there was a little fuss!",3
"Having struggled with skin that is both sensitivity and oily, I have found it difficult to find a soap that cleaned effectively without drying out my skin. For that reason, I was happy to discover that Cetaphil had added a foam wash to their product line.  I decided to give it a try.After several days of use, I have been pleased with Cetaphil's Dermacontrol Foam Wash. I use it to wash at the end of the day. Although I understand that others have been bothered by the idea that fragrances are used in the product, my skin has not been irritated at all.  I get a gentle clean which helps control oily build-up overnight which has noticeably improved my skin health.  Cetaphil foam wash has been perfect for removing the daily grime at the end of the day, allowing me to wake up with better skin. And that's a good thing.I highly recommend this excellent product to everyone.",5
"I have received so many compliments on this color!  It is the perfect grape color but is not too bright.  I have normally used Gelish, but I have to say OPI is superior, I just wish there were more color choices.",5
"I used this conditioning product along with the The shampoo for several weeks on a 2-3 times a week basis.  My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.",4
The issue I have most time with facial cleansers is the smell. This face wash scent was very light and pleasant. I leanred the hard way that a little...goes a long way so i wound up with a LOT of suds. It then became apparent it was a little hard to wash off completely. My face felt very clean...not lotiony like some other cleansers BUT i sit here now...with my skin feeling very tight...like i washed with regular soap. I'm not sure if it removes make up completely but that is my next test.,3
I have super curly kinky hair and only the Japanese Hair Straightening system will work - which costs an $$$ per hour. In between the mandatory 4 months in between I use this product and it works like magic to straighten out my curls and without leaving any heavy residue or flaking like hair gel when I use my straightening iron on it. This product is like a lotion for your hair and only a dab will do. Hard to believe but my sister and I have been using this 1 bottle over 6 months. We have super thick very long hair so to see how long this product lasts - def. worth the investment.,5
it works. along with exercise of course. But my booty is getting lifted and firm :) I love this product. smells great too,4
"I only learned of the value of shea butter last summer.  I was looking for something natural, but long lasting and good for my skin because I was breaking out with almost every other moisturizer I used.  My niece told me about shea butter so I did some research and found that raw shea butter is the best for your skin.  I ordered some and saw an amazing improvement of my overall skin tone in about 3 weeks but even better, I didn't break out.Why I like it:  raw shea butter (don't get the whipped kind or mixed with other stuff) is natural, very emollient and a little bit goes a long way.  I've used it on healthy skin, sunburned skin, skin that had a rash on it, skin that was SUPER dry and on my hair to help with friz and static.  I'm a fair fair skinned red-head so you can imagine how thankful I am to have finally found something that works but that I can also share with my husband, who is dark hair/eyes and more ruddy complexion.  Our two daughters are bi-racial and shea butter does AMAZING things for their skin.What I don't like (but can live with):* The smell of raw shea butter is something you have to grow to tolerate or appreciate.  Some people describe it as nutty, I think it smells more like a mild camp-fire smokey scent.  The scent only lasts until the shea butter is absorbed into your skin.  You can also find recipes online to whip the shea butter with your favorite essential oil and make it smell better.* It can be difficult to put on if you don't warm it up first.  The texture is similar to the wax pomade that you put on your hair to style it.  Some people microwave a bit before they rub it in, I personally find that just putting a small ball in my palms and rubbing them back and forth really fast warms it up enough to spread.  Again, if you whip it and keep it in a sealed, airtight container, it is easier to put on.All in all, I'm very pleased with this product, the amount is generous and will last a very long time.  The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don't look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  The white shea butter you see around is mixed with other things and won't give you the same benefits.It's a great product, no matter what your skin type.  I've have several people ask me what is different about me, that I look more radiant and comment on my smooth, clear skin.  So it must be doing something!",5
"I've been a big fan of a variety of Biore products for many years. In particular, I've found their pore-unclogging strips and scrubs quite effective. I also like their foaming cleanser. This particular gel though, did not work very well for me. It went on fine and lathered up nicely, but it left my skin feeling itchy and irritated with a few mild pink spots on my upper cheeks. I'm not sure what about this cleanser caused this since I have never had such a reaction before, and I don't consider my skin especially sensitive.Everyone has different reactions to skin products so I am not saying my response was typical. My skin is neither oily nor dry, but I use a cleanser to try and reduce/eliminate whiteheads on my nose. I believe that I'll stick to the scrubbing cleansers that Biore makes rather than use this gel cleanser.",2
Dark dark purple. Appears black in some lights. Good staying power especially paired with my seche vite top coat. Good OPI quality. Recommend.,5
"I love the colors in this collection.  The colors are highly pigmented and spread easily. They keep their color for a long time, cutting down on touch ups. This collection will work with just about every skin tone, so I don't think anyone should have a problem buying it and being able to use it. I am usuually leery of the big collections because of the waste factor, the colors that just don't work for certain skin tones. I have noticed that some how Shany has managed to find a good mix of blendable colors as well as stand alones. This is a great collection.  Linda W.",5
"I purchased ths @my local drugstore (but plan on purchasing a 2nd one here frm Amazon soon) & I am VERY skeptical w/ primers bc of how oily my skin gets &how; large the pores on &around; my nose are but i got ths anyway (mostly just bc I had a $2 off any revlon face product Lol) &Im; in LOVE!I have dept store primers (ex.

"I have very long, thick hair, with a fair amount of natural wave.  I have always wanted my hair to be softer than it naturally is, but have never hit on the right products to help me achieve this goal.  Pantene's Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry to Moisturized Shampoo has finally given me hair with the texture I have been seeking.  Now my hair is soft to the touch and much, mucuh easier to comb and brush.This shampoo cleans very thoroughly, has a nice, light scent, and rinses out easily and well.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and noticed the difference in my hair's managability within just a couple of uses. This has been a great shampoo for me and I plan to continue to buy it as long as Pantene makes it.",5
"I use alba face lotion and it's the only lotion I live! Decided to give this alba product a shot and liked the idea of a milky face wash. I'm impressed. Doesn't dry out my skin, doesn't leave skin greasy, haven't broken out from it. Very pleased! I love alba! Fast shipping too!",5
"Normally I'm not a huge fan of chocolate or honey scents as they do not do well with my skin chemistry but this one is blended to perfection. The honey is toned down with the chocolate and I think it works so well because it has that twinge of spiciness that covers up those notes that usually do not do well on me... Truly if you have ever been afraid to try a chocolate / honey blend this is the one to take a chance on... This perfume is one that you can wear to work or out to play and the peach note adds that grown up feel to this blend, what are you waiting for GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"I was looking for a great wooden bristle brush and this is actually my first time ever using one. I thought it would hurt my scalp because it's wood.. any who, it doesn't. It's perfect! I love it. Once I received it, I tried it that night after my shower and I let my hair air dry and combed it with a wide tooth comb. I've tried boar bristle brushes before because I was hearing so many things about it and how good it was.. it actually pulled on my hair.. which was weird. So of course, never buying a boar bristle brush again. Once I saw how amazing this brush felt on my head and how it pulled literally no hairs at all, I fell in love. It glides through my hair so beautifully. I have a lot of thin straight hair though but it's such a hassle since it's so thin that it has a lot of knots and I love how this doesn't pull on my hair nor rip and break my hair unlike some plastic brushes I have tried. I think I will forever buy these type of brushes. I literally fell in love with this brush! Oh and the bristles are actually pretty long so it's perfect for long hair! (my hair is up to my back dimples so you know it's perfect for long hair lol). The size of the brush is normal I guess. Not huge or not small. It's big enough to be able to grab and fits a lot of hair at once. It is amazingly manufactured and you can tell the wooden bristles won't fall off so good thing. I have already recommended it to the women in my family and some of my friends. Nothing negative about this.",5
"Grapefruit, orange flower, neroli, rose, amber, sandalwood, jasmine, vanilla, orris & a base of musk come together in a curvy bottle to form a soft, feminine & sensual scent which deserves 5 stars.However, half an hour after application my skin flared red, blotchy & very itchy. A real shame as the fragrance is brilliant, so good that I kept on using my 100ml bottle despite the irritation.Try before you buy!!* `Live', her third fragrance is fabulous - I suggest those with sensitive skin like myself to try it!!!",2
"First off, love the scent!  Also love the exfoliation I get.  However, the word &#34;creme&#34; is not quite accurate... a creme should rub in completely, and this does not.  I use it at night, and end up rubbing it into my hands so as not to get &#34;grease&#34; all over my sheets.  Would use it more often if it would rub in better!",3
the only problem is the stencil plastic is really long so you have to play around a bit to get it perfect. but these give my brows a fabulous shape. i would recommend any day. i use every stencil and they all look great! very natural shapes! love,4
I paired this with sleek white and it was great for a french manicure.  It is slightly pink with some shimmer but is an excellent base for french manicures.  I highly recommend Gelish polishes.,5
"I like this product as it is more convenient than normal dyeing products because its foam is so smooth and can be used evenly on my hair. I like it also because there is no color difference in different areas of my hair - each dimension looks shiny and healthy. It has been about a month since I dyed my hair, but I can barely see any color fades. A plus is that it doesn't cause allergies on my sculpt.  I would recommend it to everyone and I would definitely buy it again.",5
"I am really happy to have found this self tanner.It goes on smooth. It doesn't make streaks or turn orange.It feels good on the skin and even includes moisturizer.  It smells great, too.If you've tried self tanners and been disappointed, you'll be happy with this one. The Suave self tanner works as promised, over time, providing a natural-looking tan.Highly recommended.",5
they are very nice not cheep looking or feeling. they do what they are meant for. if i had to buy more i would.,5
"I ended up returning this. I had purchased it with  the lotion, but the scent was just awful. Really, really bad. It permeated my skin, so even when I washed it off, the scent still lingered.",1
"I purchased this tingle lotion, as I like a good tingle from time to time. I have tried products with the same amount of tingle and, while they did make me red following my tan, they did not give me the hives that this product gave me. As soon as I exited the tanning bed, my body began itching profusely and I got red bumps from head to toe. Finally, after about three hours, the rash began to fade and I was able to go to class. Well, as soon as I sat down at class my classmates surrounding me started to complain about a terrible moldy smell that lingered throughout the classroom. At one point my professor came around the room to hand back papers and she even said something smelled odd and blamed it on a leak in the roof of the building. I didn't think anything of it until I returned home and the smell had followed me.. Turns out that it was the after scent of the lotion on me. It smells similar to a wet towel shoved into a gym locker for a month. Will never be using this product again and definitely not pleased.",1
"I have short hair and Sexy Hair Balm makes styling my hair very easy, Just a little bit rubbed into your hair to shape and style and my hair is good for the day!",5
"I was very excited to try xtreme brite gel. I had seen so many reviews on the internet (amazon and youtube) but I had never heard of anyone using it in real life. However, ambi and other products never worked for me for for dark spots or underarms so I was eager.At first it worked fine, but very slow. However, my underarms did get lighter. I also used it on my knees, which I saw no change on except for peeling which was odd.I even stopped using regular deodorant which was suggested  by reviewers of the gel and I also wax my underarms which I've been doing for years.  After using almost 3 tubes in one month, I decided to stop and see and low and behold, within days, my underarms got dark again but even darker than before but this time they wont lighten back up. I desperately tried using the gel again but it is not budging.  I also started getting severe pain under my arms after stopping again which my esthetician pointed out as stretchmarks under the arms when waxing. I was so shocked so I will never ever use it again.BUt I may just be one of the exceptions.",1
"When I bought these, I wasn't into makeup as much as I am now.They blended pretty well but I always dropped them on the ground and just ended up throwing them away.",3
"This is ok, but I don't like it as much as the oil or the oil spray.  I don't think I will be buying this again.  Plus it was open was I received it.",3
"when I bought it I thought, ""what if it's not as big as i think it will be!!"" but then.. it came and it was bigger than i thought! it holds all of my mascara, and eye shadow sponge brushes, and blush brushes, and all of my other makeup accessories it was such a great find!!!",5
"Great product that really holds.  It's enabled me to try some new styles in the hottest and most humid summertime weather,  And the styles held up for hours!  I highly recommend!",5
"It seems like there were some issues because people who were sensitive failed to follow the test procedures and they changed what could be put in alpha hydroxy products.  Maybe I just think that's what happened.  Who knows...either way, this stuff is nothing like the Alpha Hydrox cleanser I remember from my teen years.  VERY disappointing.  Gets your skin clean, but no fantastic results like it used to.",2
"This suntan lotion has a slight medicinal scent I'm not wild about, but I do like it better than the overly sweet fake coconut scent of other suntan lotions.It is very lotion like, it dispenses easily and absorbs quickly leaving skin feeling moisturized. None of the fairer members of my family have had sunburns so far this summer. This year has been breaking records in Anchorage, Alaska for number of sunny days so it's been well tested.It does cause a slight build up with regular re-application, so you'll want to shower it off in the evening if you are spending hours in the sun.It works as described, and it's a good choice if you need a lotion as well as sunblock. It hasn't caused any irritation for anyone in my family.",4
"Compared to my regular 1800 watt all purpose blow dryer with a diffuser, this Conair dryer is quieter, not as hot and has a wider area of air distribution. It's not so powerful so as to blow your curls around vigorously and turn them into a frizzy nest. I got shiny, soft, frizz free curl definition and volume with this Ionic Ceramic Styler Dryer.I like the flat diffuser attachment to cradle my shoulder length curls. I'm not sure how it would handle longer length curly hair. If you you dry your hair with it flipped upside down for volume this dryer is so much easier to manage than the regular dryer. Overall it's nice and works well, but a concentrater attachment would be helpful for the option of blow drying your curls straight too. It doesn't seem as sturdy as most dryers, only time will tell how this dryer holds up.This is very specialized for the curly heads or someone that wants a slower dry to allow natural curls and waves to rule. So if you are a curl aficianado and follow the curly rules to ""Stick with the low and medium settings for temperature and air"" prescribed by the high priestess of curls, Ouidad, then this IS the dryer for you!",4
"This soap smells nice and soaps up well.  It does not clog my pores or dry out my skin either.  My only complaint is that it does not moisturize as well as a body wash.  The soap, as with all bar soaps I have used, leaves a tight, almost draggy feeling on my skin.  Therefore, I would pick a body wash over the bar soap formula.",4
"I thought I knew all the basic Olay products, but this was a great discovery. I've used the sensitive skin SPF 15 and 30 lotions for years; they were the only thing that didn't start to make my skin sting after awhile. I was out of luck for night time. I've tried them all--Cetaphil, Aveeno, Neutrogena, Clinique--you name it. They would be OK for awhile and then I'd get the stinging. With this, there is absolutely no problem after six weeks. Sometimes it's best to stick with the basics. Highly recommended.",5
I like how light this gel is and that if I use in limited amounts it won't make my curls clump together. The only drawback is that it sometimes makes my hair feel a bit sticky and does nothing to limit frizziness.,4
"I just love this eyelash separator. It's very easy to clean; I hold it down at the bottom of the basin under really hot water and all traces of mascara are gone. I'm sure I don't need to mention this again, but you have to maintain caution to avoid poking yourself in the eye. Ouch...",5
"Like others, I was convinced when I tried this product. Please be patient, because you will probably have to use this product for 6 full weeks to really see the effects as your new lashes grow in.I am an Asian woman, and although I am lucky in that I have slightly more eyelashes than some of my fellow Asians, they tend to be short fine.  I wanted something that would lengthen and thicken my eyelashes, because I have difficulty using fake lashes.During the first week, I noticed that my bottom lashes doubled in length and were noticeably thicker. This really helped me stay with the product for the full month and a half it took to see results. It was hard to do, because  for a the next 5 weeks, it felt that the top lashes grew only a few millimeters. When curling my eyelashes in the morning, I saw that my eyelashes were definitely getting longer a little thicker, but not to the length that would make it worth my money to keep buying this product.  It wasn't until around the 6th week that I really saw results. Before, my eyelash tips only reached halfway up the eyelash curler in the morning, but now, most of my hairs reach the tip of the metal eyelash curler blade easily (Shu Uemura). They are also much darker and thicker than before that when I put on mascara, it looks like I have fake lashes in there. (I use only one coat of CG Lashblash luxe)I did notice a bit of darkening of the skin above my lash line, but my skin was already a bit darker there anyway. The difference was not really noticeable until you get really close. It also does make you eyes drier. This was a problem whenever my seasonal dry eye flared up, at which point, I would discontinue use until the dry eye went away.  Then I would resume use.  After the first 6 weeks, I stopped using the serum  every day, and switched to every other day, then three times a week, and then to once a week. I am now resuming a 3-day a week schedule and it seems to maintain my lashes well. In the morning, when your eyes are really dry after using Rapidlash, a good gel eye drop should take care of it, like Genteal, which I also use for my severe dry eye.Do be persistent and consistent with your use. No need to apply twice a day, because it does not seem to help. If you apply to the top of your lashes only, it still seems to migrate down to your lower lashes without any help. Your lower lashes will decrease in length and size first when you stop using this product. Your top lashes take a while to get smaller again. Also, do not be surprised if the tiny hairs around your eyes - lunago, I think it's called? everyone has it - gets darker and more noticeable. I carefully pluck these away. It is a bit more painful than other parts of your body though.I have introduced my sister to this product, and after 3 months, I saw her again and it worked  for her too. I hope you all have a good experience with this product too.",5
"Love the results! even skin tone small pores, smoother skin! Great price! Gentle on skin, no irritation! Would buy again",5
"I love them. I ordered 2 sets. If you're looking for something small for your artwork, these are them. I use them for sculpting but they can used for just about anything you need a small brush for.",5
"This works great and offers great coverage. I use it to cover dark undereye circles as well and all other imperfections on my face.  It lasts well, but will last all day if I powder under my eyes lightly after foundation and then again after concealer. My only complaint would be that it does settle in the fine lines under my eyes a bit, but that's probably just the thickness of it.",5
"I ordered a bunch of these stickers. This one, the eyes, the blk & pnk stars, blk & blue stars and music notes. Very pretty but...SO HARD TO PEEL IT OFF THE BROWN PAPER! I ended up, messing a couple off and got frustrated. Don't waste your time looking at these or your $$$! Will never buy again.",3
Yes.  This is another great deal on Proactiv deep cleansing wash for 8 oz.  This is not part of 3-Step facial cleansing.  This product can be used on the other parts of your body.  I use it in the shower only occasionally maybe 2 days/week.  I think it helps keep your body cleansed and less prone for acne.  I would recommend this product for those who like Proactiv products and the 8 oz bottle should last you awhile.,5
"I have been an insomniac all my life but don't like the adverse effects of most sleep aids. This was given as a gift to me. I would have never thought that something like this could work! I rub some on my temples and my lips and I slowly relax and fall asleep much more easily. Of course when I am completely wired it won't work as well or as fast, but I was amazed that on some nights that I forgot to use it I tossed and turned for while. Then I put this on and then fell asleep! I don't know how it works but it does. The smell is very discreet and pleasant.",4
"I was hoping this would be more effective than it turned out to be. It works well on large pimples, but that's about it. Didn't really work at all for black heads or clogged pores. I still have it, just in case, but rarely use it.",3
"Easy to use as rhinestones on nail art decorations.  Very small, which is what you want, so be prepared.  Good color selection.",5
"Love this product.  Just add a few drops to any brand goopy polish, roll between your hands and you're good to go!! It's like the polish is brand new!!",5
"I tried this product different ways to try to make it work. I tried it with a heavy hand, I tried very little, I tried large sections, I tried small sections, I tried it with other products, I tried it alone and NONE OF IT WORKED. I give up. I will give the rest of this away. Every time I tried this, I had hard, unmanageable hair. The Souffle smells like heaven and my hair was SUPER SOFT while it was wet, but once it dried, it was crunchy and tangly. Will NEVER buy this product again.",1
"I use Revision Vitamin C ( which is great) and when I was ordering it, I noticed this and decided to try it. I am so glad I did. It goes on nicely, and quickly adapts to my skin tone. It has just the right coverage and in fact have stopped using my BB cream. I am anxious for spring to come to see how the SPF works.",5
Bought this to see how the results would be a but was disappointed in the results.  Too greasy with little if any resutls. Won't buy again.,3
"Pink-A-Boo is a semi-sheer baby pink with iridescent blue and pink micro glitter. It is buildable, and became opaque in 3 coats. The shimmer really turns a safe (and boring) baby pink into something special. Adds a fun twist to a plain french manicure. The formula is good and goes on smooth-- but I wouldn't expect anything less from Essie!",5
"I use this on my face once every few days, but my great discovery is that it works so well on my hands, which have taken a beating since I am a potter by profession, gardener by choice and a horse rider for sheer love of it. This stuff really makes a difference.  I use it on my face and then on the top of my hands and then around the nails, where I get really scaly and dirty---its great--once done I can oil my hands and nails and they look and feel wonderful.",4
"This shampoo feels very rich. I have long fine hair. It leaves my hair clean and shiny without stripping it. Even though it doesn't weigh my hair down, it does take quite a bit more rinsing than usual to get it all out of my hair after I've lathered.",5
"This may be a fine product. I gave it 4 stars because of that.  I researched others before purchasing this one.  I am a green eyed blonde.  My eyebrows are so light they are barely noticeable.  I  was so disappointed when I received this and found  it is metallic gold, not blonde!  It might actually look good over another brow color such as true blonde, taupe or brown shades, but alone, it does not work.  I believe the company should disclose that this is a metallic gold and not call it blonde.  I hate returning things so will probably just look for blonde in another brand and use this one as a top highlight color, if that will work.  Or, I might use it to highlight strands of hair around my face!  Or, I could use it for holiday parties.  Oh well...these things happen, not a big deal.",4
"downsides: the glue, but you dont really need it. one of the dotting pens came apart but is easily fixed with some glue.overall satisfied with the rhinestones & dotting pens!",4
"This is the first time I tried a topical vitamin C.  I don't need any moisturizer on my face so it was relatively easy for me to use.  According to Dr. Oz, a topical vitamin C for use around the eyes should contain 3% to 10% of vitamin C.I used this serum once per day at nighty and applied around the eyes.  I think this is a commonly recommended way to use it.  One of the advantages to this serum is that it stimulates production of collagen.  That makes the skin look more plump and it increases its elasticity.  When the skin brightens up due to collagen production, it also reduces discoloration.I like this serum and hope to be using it for a long time.  Sample provided for review.",5
"This stuff smells great and lasts for quite a while throughout the day. Not to mention my wife really thought it smelled ""sexy"". I would give it five stars except for the trashy advertising on the back of the bottle! Come on people, I have young boys in my home that I don't want reading about how this product will get you sex!",4
"I've been using this shampoo/conditioner for the last couple of weeks and it's without a doubt the best dandruff shampoo/conditioner that I have come across--better than Head and Shoulders.While it's not as highly medicated as Head and Shoulders, it's just as effective and my hair doesn't feel weighed down or sticky.  Also, my hair is softer and my scalp feels like it can breath.",5
Yup. Five stars,5
"&#8220;I really love the fact that it's actually healing my skin not just putting a liquid band aid on it (that only works for24 hours if you pay double). Besides it having the phytoceramides it also contains vitamins A, C, D, and E as well so your getting multiple benefits from each. I have acne, extremely dry skin, rashes and scars. I am a poster child for skin disorders. This product has really helped with my problems already in the first month. I can't wait to see if it helps with my flaky nails too. I'm really happy I found these.",5
"I use this for my hair (straight and fine) when long and also on my daughter's thick curly hair.  For me, with long straight hair, it leaves my hair tangle-free, shiny, less prone to static, and overall in much nicer condition.  I have to use a tiny tiny amount, probably less than a full drop, or it will get greasy.  The right amount, however, makes my hair extremely shiny and beautiful.  My daughter has the opposite problem, of thick curly hair which is impossible to comb through.  For her, shine isn't the issue but instead I use it as a detangler and to make her hair less frizzy.  I've used this product for more than ten or eleven years and have found it consistently reliable.  The price is right, it smells nice, lasts all day, and is versatile for both our hair types.  I have tried (and tried and tried) many other brands when I run out of this every now and then, but have now given up and realized nothing will beat this for us and signed up for the subscribe and save so we don't run out anymore.",5
I ordered this peppermint leave in because I loved the lavender scent so much. You only need a dime size of this leave in and it does the job for moisturization. This will lasts so long because it only takes a little bit and a little bit goes a long way. I love this and you will too if you have African American hair. Natural hair loves this leave in. Thank you Dr. bronners.,5
"I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates (very drying), silicones, alcohols and parabens. This shampoo is amazing! It smells fantastic and cleans very well. I use EO's restorative conditioner after and my hair looks fabulous and my curls are magazine-worthy!!I purchased an entire line of EO hair products - shampoo, conditioner, pre-shampoo and styling cream and the gel for curly hair. I love every single product.It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well. Thanks EO Products!!!!",5
I have been using Dove for the past 7 years and I love the Deep Moisture and the Cucumber bodywashes. But I do not favor the cream oil one. It comes out way too thick and the scent is heavily perfumed. I will always by the first ones I mentioned but I would avoid the cream oil bodywashes if you don't like a heavy heavy perfume scent.,2
"These are absolutely amazing for the price. Best deal I have seen for the amount of plates you get. Went looking for stamping kit when I saw the &#8220;As seen on Tv&#8221; one, received this and I am excited to try out all the different designs. It works good. Receive several compliments on my nails when I have the stamp designs on them. Everyone wants to know how I did it.",5
"This is my third comb, keep losing them because they are small.  Does a great job of brushing brows up, mediocre job of separating lashes, works marginally if I comb the lashes from above, not from below.  But can't beat it for an inexpensive brow brush.",5
Made my skull itchy and my hair dry. It does nothing to protect against humidity.I wasted 6 bucks on this at Walgreens. Do not waste you money on this.,1
"The title speaks for itself hahah sorry I had to write that. This product feels so amazing to me!!! I have NEVER in my life, used a toner that didn't burn or tingle...this toner feels like your putting refreshing water on your face. I can't rave enough about this...I've been using it for 1-2 weeks now and I am in love with this toner and will never venture away from it EVER. It works just the same as any other toner but feels smoother and better for your skin. I know alot of reviewers didn't like the smell but I LOVE the smell. It smells pleasant to me and not too strong and I even use it while pregnant and my senses still like the smell lol. My Fiancee said it smelled like pesticides when he leaned over to kiss me which made me crack up hysterically but I guess everyone has different senses.",5
"I painted my nails with this about 4 hours ago and ALL of my fingers have chipped already.  Is also very flat, definitely needs a top gloss of clear nail polish or it looks just like marker.  Great color but would not buy this again.  Glad it was cheap.",1
"I've been using this product for about 6 months now.  While I've found some great body washes & body scrubs for treating body blemishes/breakouts since those are used IN the shower, you are washing away the medicine & it can only do so much.  I found the washes to be more useful for treating existing acne rather than preventing it.  As much as I love the Murad & Peter Thomas Acne body scrubs/washes & they have definitely helped, nothing has been able to completely resolve my body acne, till this!  Even my dermatologist had gotten to the point of wanting to put me on Acutane.  Thankfully I just kept looking at products & found this before having to try Acutane.Pros:This product is a liquid, so you have great coverage, sprays upside down as well, which is useful for applying to your back area and doesn't stain your clothes.  It has a nice tingly feeling when you put it on & the salicylic acid continues to work throughout the day.  You will literally notice an improvement within 24 hours & more benefits with continued use.I have also noticed that my skin has gotten softer & smoother, which I haven't experienced from any other products.Cons:Little high maintenance because you have to wait 5+ minutes for it to dry before getting dressed.  So hopefully you can roam your house in the nude for awhile.When I first started using it (about 6 months ago) I would apply it daily to my chest & back after showering.  So I was originally going through a bottle every 1 1/2 months which was a little pricey.  But after using it for about 3 months, I now only need to use it about once a week!  If you've ever had problematic skin, you get to a point where you don't really care what something costs, as long as it works.  So while this was more of a hassle to me to have to order a lot, I can see it seeming expensive to some.",5
This is the best product I have ever used on my nails. I can not believe they have grown out and I now have beautiful long nails.  Stays on longer than any other product I have used.,5
"This shampoo is great if you have very hard water. I noticed a huge difference. I will use this stuff forever. My hair is finally looking the way it is supposed to. It is also a good idea to get a shower filter to make your water soft to make your hair softer. Also, this product smells wonderful. It lathers great and has a great texture. Love this stuff.",5
"I have short, thin, curly hair.......and this stuff is the best! Worth every penny! My hair looks like I have no product on but with a clean firm hold. The smell is clean....not strong and doesn't get in the way of colone.",5
"Out of nowhere, I started to develop adult acne. I mainly break out twice a month. So whenever the redness and marks would start to go away, new acne would pop up. So I always had new pimples and old marks. I was so frustrated. I used the top acne lines out there and they almost seemed to make it worse. So I tried this product. I would cleanse my face, apply this to the effected areas and then use a moisturizer. This has worked better for me than the well-known acne treatments. And the best part is that it's inexpensive.",5
Recommended by a someone who runs a salon it seems to be working fairly well.  Don't expect quick results with this or any nail fungus treatment.  It's a slow process.,4
good to store and use whenever you want ad very cheap I love this and would most likely buy again and again,5
"LOve the way it seals it up, no smell and you can use it for up to 12 hours at a time. However, getting it in place can be tricky and removal is best done in the shower. Actually insertion might be best done in the shower where you can squat down and get it in there correctly then wash off any mess left behind. Feels clean and comfortable when properly placed, you forget it is even there. Make sure to change every twelve hours though. Recommended.",5
"I use these gloves in the shower about 2-3 days a week to help get rid of dead, dried up skin cells and just exfoliate my skin. I figured for $5 it was cheaper than buying another sugar scrub. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked! They are more &#34;scratchy&#34; than a regular wash cloth, but not enough to do any damage by actually scratching your skin. Plus, you can't go wrong with coral pink!",5
These are good products.  They really work; my hands crack in the winter.  I put this on daily and it softens and soothes my poor hands.  Same thing for the Healthy Feet product.,5
"I wanted a good, bright orange lipstick and this is perfect. The lipstick itself is very creamy and the color lasts a long while! The color is close to hi-liter orange. Beautiful on pale skin!",5
"Before my husband tried this shampoo on his hair, I tried it on my shoulder length, fine textured hair. The scent was mild and not overly perfumey and it had kind of a gel/lotion consistency right out of the bottle. It was a masculine type scent, a little citrusy. It lathered well and rinsed out easily. I used a Morrcan Shine conditioner and dried my hair as usual.  My hair had a ""fluffier"" feel to it, more body and felt really soft.  When my husband used the shampoo he thought it gave his hair a nice texture and he liked the fragrance. The label says it contains caffeine and calcium. I'm not sure how they would be absorbed into the hair strand, but my hair did look shiny and full after using it.",5
"Overall, this is a fairly nice little kit. You get a separate tube for each day's use of product, which is convenient. Though they did kind of go just a touch overboard on the size and amount of packaging.One thing you really have to watch for is that this isn't going to keep up with you very well if you have a lot of hair. That might be why it didn't work as well for me as it did for some people. The product is just spread a little too thin.It's convenient and it does seem to help, though, so it's a nice way to do a round of deep conditioning from time to time.",4
"Actually a pretty good product.  I already use & love the Clear so I thought I'd try this.  I have fine thin hair so I have to be careful what kind of conditioner I use.  My hair is also long and streaked so it's pretty dry.This product worked well at taking out the tangles and softening the hair.  I do think I rinsed a bit too much as my hair was still a little dry.With that in mind, I will be careful not to rinse it all out.It did not weigh my hair down and it did make it shine.Also smells good.I will probably continue to use this product.Thank you.MEF",4
Love this oil ..Made my face soft and supple plus softened my tiny fine lines im 63 and if your consistant with the product you will see  a difference  Use it faithfully before bed and the product just absorbs right into my skin.  People have told me that they thought i was in my early 40S.  So take that compliment to the bank.Even though i have an olive completion the oil itself is great ladies.But you have to use it daily before bed to get good results.Give it about 3-4 months.,4
"I recommend this to everyone!!! This scent is amazing, absolutely one of my 20 favorite scents of all time. I will keep rebuying it always!!!",5
omg!!! this product puts an end to the scorch marks on the bathroom sink or whatever else you rest your curling irons on while you section off pieces to curl. i LOVE this item!,5
"This is the best eyeshadow!! Goes on smoothly, no eye lid prepping (such as foundation...) and stays on a long time - and NO CREASING! Will buy every color combo out there!!!",5
"Review of Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream (2 Oz.).  I received this product through the Vine program in exchange for an honest review.This is actually an excellent product.  I initially ordered with my wife in mind, but I found myself using it as well.  The product claims that it is a ""medium-weight moisturizer with restorative benefits.""  In addition it claims that it's hydration ""replenishes dry, dulling skin suffering from the signs of aging.""What I looked at the ingredients I could not find any description but listed instead was what the cream was not made of.  The Cream claims that it is not made with parabens, sulfates. synthetic fragrances, synthetic dyes, mineral oil or petroleum.  In addition the cream is fragrance free.  The product boasts that ""powerful extracts and antioxidants boost collagen levels for noticeable tightening and firming.""  I found that upon contact with the skin that effect does seem to take place.  It tightens skin and provides the desired results.  In short the Eclos Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream is a viable natural alternative to other anti-aging ointments.  Five stars.",5
"I just started this product about 2 weeks ago. I cannot give an accurate review until a full month of use. However, i must state i am pleased with the supply and the shipping. I was recommended to purchase this product through a coworker. She has experienced great results; retained luster, growth, and aiding to psoriasis. I will try to remember to repost my personal experience. Good luck!",5
I tried a few of the Gratiae products at a kiosk in the mall and was pretty blown away. I only bought the body scrub though because the products are a little pricey. I wanted to find the other product that I tried and thought this might be it but I don't think so. I need something to clear up my acne and blemishes but I haven't found anything so far. This smells good and its ok but I thought it would be better.,3
"Honestly, I love the stuff. I am reading all of the reviews regarding rash outbreaks. I am curious how I have not experienced any rashes; especially since I have sensitive skin. I did buy this product when it was first released; perhaps the ingredients changed?The ingredients on my bottle are as follows: Mineral Oil, Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Fragrance.I have experienced no rashes at all, and I even use this as a personal lubricant. My guess is that the ingredients have been changed at some point, but perhaps not? Let me know, I really like the stuff.",5
"My wife decided to try out this hairspray and was very satisfied with the results. She has very thin hair and she said that although the effects of the spray do not last for a long time they are perfect for when she needs to go to a DAR meeting or some other event. She loves everything coconut - to eat, like coconut shrimp for example, or anything with the scent of coconut like this hairspray.I am not crazy about coconut but when she returns from her meetings or whatever the coconut scent on her hair is gone or, if not, it has faded out to an acceptable level, in my opinion only. She recommends this hair spray and especially to anyone who does not have an anti coconut scent house member hanging around.",4
"I really really love this conditioner. I have coarse 4b/4c hair and have a hard time keeping it moisturized. I discovered this hair care line after reading a natural hair care book. And, I am so grateful I found it. This conditioner is pretty thick and has all natural ingredients. There are no parabens, no silicones, and plenty of natural oils to help nurse hair back to health or maintain a healthy hair care regimen.I have started using it as a leave-in and a styling agent. My hair loves it! I would definitely recommend it for those who want to lose the chemicals, get back to basics, and purchase high quality items.In terms of getting a deal, I would recommend keeping an eye on sales at Walgreen's and Target. They often have buy one, get one free deals. This price is a joke. Target always has this product for $10 or less.",5
"This is a nice curling ""wand"" if you have the dexterity to curl your hair without the clamp usually found on curling wands.  Admittedly, I don't curl my hair often, but when I do I am not very good and doing it without extra help, like a clamp to hold my hair onto the wand.The heat glove included is a plus but I still found it scary to use, especially because in the instructions, it says not to use it to rest the hot wand on.  So I wasn't really feeling secure that my hand wouldn't get burned by the glove melting on me.The wand heated up nicely, with different temperatures to cook the various hair types.  The fact that there is no clamp makes it a little more compact, if that helps with your buying decision.",3
"I own the older version also, which is not digital. I bought the S-2004 about 5 years ago and it it works as great now as it did then. My 15-yr old daughter began straigtening her hair a few months ago, so I purchased another brand for her. She always came back to borrow mine, so I ended up giving her mine with the intention of buying a new straightening iron for me. I had purchased (and returned) 3 others, but they all pinched my fried & frizzy(from coloring), thick, long hair. My daughter's hair is very long as well, and this works great for both of us. So I had to go and buy this one. The other reviewers are correct, this thing gets HOT. I set it to 360(only the 2nd or 3rd setting). There is no way anybody would want it hotter than that. I LOVE this straightener! It never pinches my hair, my hair simply glides through the plates. I hold a brush in front of the plates while straightening bcz certain parts of my hair are frizzy, but my daughter doesn't; either way it performs outstanding. The plates are rounded, so I do a little flip on the ends at the same time I straighten the rest. I really do not know how anyone cannot love this straightener. The 3 straighteners that I tried were all more expensive-and they could not compare. All straighteners should have woven teflon on the plates. I agree that the buttons are not thoughtfully placed. However, for those ppl who have problems with the buttons: Hold the decrease temperature button (-) for appx 3 seconds to lock the temperature. Hold the power button for 3 seconds to shut  the unit off.",5
"I just ordered my second bottle of this (first lasted several months).  I am extremely prone to acne breakouts, whiteheads and blackheads even at my advanced age of 65+.  I use it every morning after applying a saclicylic acid and then apply an oil free moisturizer on top of the Bel Essence.  The Bel Essence is absorbed quickly so I just wait a couple of minutes before applying moisturizer.  On some days I just apply SA and then Bel Essence and nothing else except maybe a sunscreen.I notice a definite diminution difference in my nose/chin lines and my skin feels wonderful and soft.  Other products I have used that were much more expensive, often clogged my pores or felt greasy; not this one!With the advent of summer and gardening and sweating, I frequently have whiteheads on chin no matter how often during the day I wash my face; so am not applying  Bel Essence there just as a precaution.I definitely recommend this product.",5
Smells nice and the conditioning was ok.  I thought the Vanilla and Sweet Orange version did a better job at conditioning my hair.,4
"This is one of those fragrances that are here to stay, it smells really good, ideal for summer, it's clean and fresh...women like it and they say it resembles Green Irish Tweed from Creed which is $100 plus more.. a must have for a summer scent in your collection",4
"Yes this little steamer does get the job done. It produces steam for my at home facials, doesn't take too long to start steaming and I don't have to keep refilling the little ""pot"" where you put the water to heat up. I am happy with this purchase and glad I finally brought it.",5
"First, it might help to know my hair type and what I was expecting from this flat-iron. My hair is all natural (kinky), thick, and falls just below my shoulders. When I flat-iron my hair, I don't aim for bone straight; I like to keep some of my hair's natural texture. For the most part this flat-iron does just that, however...* The digital display is impossible to read from certain angles,* The plates don't lay flush with one another when closed (see the uploaded image for a comparison with a Gold 'n Hot flat-iron) and if you want to get the plates flush, you'll end up with burned fingers...* The handle, near the plates, gets quite hot--problematic for those who have large hands or who prefer to grip near the plates for better leverage and to get the plates flush with each other for more even straightening.Even with those disadvantages, I do love that this is a high temp. (450F) straightener which heats up quickly--within a minute or two--and *stays* hot, that it has longer plates which allow me to do larger sections of hair at a time, it does glide over my hair, and using it was more comfortable than expected.",3
"I purchased the smaller brushes from this line and had to order these bigger brushes and boy am I glad that I did. These brushes are AMAZING with a capital A.  I would even say that they have been better than some high end brushes that I have purchased.  There has been no shedding at all. There was a slight smell to them but after washing them and even using Elf's daily brush spray cleaner, they no longer have a smell. Great brushes!",5
"So not worth the price. Smells great (yes), makes hair soft (yes), does miracles (no). I have been using Palmers coconut oil conditioner and I get better results. This is honestly just sitting in my shower. It kinda weighs down my this hair and I see no difference in it's health...",4
"The Hyaluronic Serum is a very nice thick consistency that absorbs quickly and leaves no chemical scent behind. I try to make sure that the skincare products I use now are not scented as I have sinus issues and scents can really mess with them, so I make this a priority now. I also make it a priority that my serums absorb quickly and leave no shiny or greasy film on my face and this one didn't, so that is another plus on it's side.I love that they use a blend of herbal ingredients to help make this formula work on our skin. It contains no alcohols and no parabens. I also love that it is a Non-Comedogenic formula and is completely Botanical and  perfect for all skin types, which means it will work with sensitive skin like mine. It works by keeping the skin hydrated, elastic and youthful looking, while helping to plump fine lines and wrinkles. That in turn diminishes their appearance causing it to look like an instant face lift, which I love. But, it will be cumulative and will eventually help you look better the more that you use it.The bottle of serum came in this velour bag and that is how I keep it stored. Most serums are best if they are kept in the dark in a cool place. If I am seeing that it might take me awhile to use up a skincare product because I review so many, I store them in the door of my fridge to help them last longer, especially all natural or organic ones.Plus, I found that the cooler the serum is when putting it on, it acts like an instant line plumper and will make them disappear quicker. I learned that from listening to models who splash ice cold water on their faces right before a shoot. It constricts the blood vessels giving them a smoother and clearer face.Also, Xfacio Labs Serum is packaged in scientifically proven Biophotonic Violet Glass which not only preserves the formula longer than any other, it actually enhances the potency over time. No other brand goes to such length or expense to ensure that you are getting the highest quality product!",5
"I've been using natural cosmetics for a number of years. I've been using Ecco Bella's wonderful blushes and also use some products from Bare Essentials and Aromaleigh (a great mineral make-up company) but had never tried Ecco Bella's Mascara before.I don't wear Mascara often but when I do I have to be really careful of which type as I have very sensitive eyes; I've mostly used Maybelline waterproof (my only non-natural cosmetic!) as it stays put and doesn't bother my eyes, so I was very curious how I'd like the Ecco Bella brand Mascara.It's terrific!  The brown is a very nice color, sort of a dark brown which is my usual shade.  They say it's not waterproof but listed as water resistant but I found it to wear as well as my waterproof variety.  The brush is nice and long and you get a good coat from one application, it dries fairly quickly, stays put and did not irritate my eyes (my most important requirement!:)I am VERY happy with this mascara, it's a keeper!",5
like it very much and my daughter to know we can do many more design with this.. Thank you very much for this item.,5
"This is a very complete set for stamping your nails, very easy for beginners too!  So many plates with so many choices of decos!  Quick Shipping. I would definitely recommend this product!",5
"I have a wonderful mix of aging and hormonal skin. If I do a deep hydration for the fine lines and peeling (from trying to rid cavernous pores of blackheads) I break out in cystic acne. If I do a light moisturizer I don't break out but look haggard and peely. Awesome. This moisturizer is fantastic. Deeply hydrates, smells wonderful, not greasy but gives a pleasant glow. And no painful breakouts! This is a forever purchase for me. Excited to try other Eminence products after such a positive experience. Totally worth the money. Seller shipped product quickly and it came with a safety seal under the cap and boxed. New item in excellent condition. No leakage.",5
"This is the same 2% salycilic acid as in the Murad gel. Murad costs about 5 times more, however. This product works best when you use it every single night. At first your skin may break out more as it ""boils"" all the acne to the surface. But after 2 weeks you will notice less acne and acne will disappear completely if you keep using this every night. The other Murad item that is a great spot treatment is the Sulphur cream. Amazon has a good low cost version of this as well:De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment CreamThe sulphur cream can be applied on top of a pimple, preferably a few times per day and within 12 hours you will see a rapid reduction of the pimple's size and tenderness. Sulfur kills the bacteria. The third item in Murad is the salicylic wash which is equivalent to the Neutrogena gel washNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce. The final item should be an oil-free SPF30 moisturizer applied every morningNeutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35, 2.5  Ounce. You may need to use this gel in the morning and at night if it doesn't seem to be getting rid of all the acne after 2 weeks.I promise you if you use these you will cure your acne. I wish I had had this in high school. But now I am setting up my own kids with this system. It will also help to fade your acne scars.This 2% salicylic acid gel exists elsewhere (Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion, 1.7 Ounce (Pack of 3)) but in much less volume for the same price. So this is a really good deal...I expect Neutrogena 3-in-1 hydrating acne treatment  will be discontinued because it is a better value than the Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion.Update: This is disappearing from stores, but Neutroogena still sells it for a reasonable price on their site.",5
"It unfolds to about as wide as a hand towel but twice as long, which makes it really easy to scrub your back.  Folded up, it's the texture and the amount of lather of one of those exfoliating bath puffs.  It does exfoliate really well.  My elbows look great.The fact that it unfolds to a thin cloth also makes me think it's a lot more hygienic than many other exfoliating bath products.  It dries out completely in a short amount of time, which makes it less of a breeding ground for mold than pretty much any other exfoliating sponge/mitt/puff/brush I've ever tried.It is a quite rough, plastic-y, material.  It's great for scaly feet and elbows.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.  I don't think anyone should use it on their face.",5
I have used about everything on the market and still come back to this. All of the Olay Total Effect 7 is great.,5
"I have pretty much pale skin, do self tan , use the Fake Bake flawless self tanner spray or lotion, but never dared to try a facial tanner.Am definitely a make up girl and found a great match with Cinema Secrets, great product for middle aged gals:) as it does not settle in pores that much , use it with the cinema secrets moisturizer to spread it out and make it look flawless and puts some glow back :)But back to this awesome product, if not for my adult acne scares I could not believe how I achieved the same awesome color like I get from my make up with this facial tanner in just one application.It is a nice subtle Jennifer Anniston glow tan , best way I can describe it.I also use it over my hands and feet ! which I originally purchase it for, give it a try on your face over the weekend, apply one thin layer and be careful around the hairline and eyebrows. Leave it on over night and see how you like it in the morning, I can promise you that it will NOT turn you to dark (my biggest fear) and left no streaks , omg why can they not make a cheaper, bigger bottle for the body of this stuff? and you can easily cover it up with your normal make up .I was so pleasantly surprised, wow, definitely recommend, nice if you go work out, go to the beach and want to not use make up , and just cover up some blemishes with concealer.",5
"I BOUGHT THESE BRUSHES AND I LOVE THE WAY THEY FEEL.THESE BRUSHES ARE BIG,BEAUTIFUL,AND THE BRISTLES ARE EXTREMELY SOFT.GOOD QUALITY BRUSHES.THE BRISTLES AND VERY DENSE AND HOLD UP WELL.IM THINKING ABOUT BUYING MY FRIEND THESE BRUSHES FOR HER BIRTHDAY.",5
"good to use as a treatment product  to add a lot of moisture.  i put it on generously, massage it into my scalp, and let it sit for a few hours while i do housework, then wash out.  but it's not something i can use and then go out into public with.  i can tell it's good for my hair & scalp...my hair feels healthier & stronger since i've been using it...but even just using a few drops used sparingly on the ends of my mid-back length hair makes it look too oily.i LOVE the scent!it's hard to get out of the bottle, because as most coconut oils are, it's a solid at room temperature.  i've put it into a larger-mouthed container, which makes it possible to scoop out a dab, instead of having to try to squeeze it out.  that helps.",3
I love this stuff! It feels wonderful going on and absorbs quickly. My complexion all ways looks brighter after application. This vitamin C serum causes no irritation to my skin and along with my lotion helps my face stay moisturized all day long.,5
I bought this to fix my hyperpigmentation.I do not really know why this didn't work for me. But it darken my hyperpigmentation areas by 5 shades. Please do not get this. Avon Glycolic retexturing Peel is much better. I am now struggling to get rid of the darker patches.,1
"Pros: I bought this after it was highly recommended by my esthetician. It has an amazing scent and made my skin feel clean and fresh. It was gentle on my sensitive skin.Cons: I am acne prone and this did nothing to help decrease my acne. I so badly wanted a more natural solution, but I am back to salicylic acid type products.",3
"Flawless look. I love this, it works just like the bare minerals product, but for a lot cheaper of a price.",5
"I have oily skin with BIG pores and wanted something to help keep them clear and possibly reduce the size of the pores.  Well, this peel does help to clear out the pores, but does nothing to really permanent to reduce them.  My pores might seem smaller after a treatment with the Salicylic Acid 30% Skin Peel, but it is just temporary.  I have read ""more"" than once that pore size is determined by several factors, one of them being genetic.  Well yeah, my dad had oily skin and big pores---so lucky me I inherited a propensity to very oily skin. LOL, although it is NOT a laughing matter and sometimes I could just bawl!Good for clearing skin out as salicylic acid is better at getting through oil on the face than glycolic acid is.  So, if you have acne and/or oily skin this can be a boon.  Just be careful as it is strong and follow the directions or you could burn your face.  RINSE it off with lots of water and apply an oil-free moisturizer.  DON'T pick at your skin if it peels some as that can cause scarring. Be patient!",4
"I love this product because it smells great and has cocoa butter in it. This lotion is light enough to use on your face under makeup, right before bed and to reapply during the day as needed. It is not greasy, not heavy, and the fragrance is not overpowering. I use mine as a face lotion, its great.",5
"I bought this towel to wrap around my hair because normal bath towels make my hair frizzy. This towel definitely cuts down on frizz and makes my hair look much more tame. It is the perfect size to wrap my head with and does not feel to heavy on it. The only issue I have with this towel is that it is not as absorbent as I need it to be. If I had fine to normal hair, I would probably give this product 5 stars. However, I have a lot of thick, curly hair that sops up water like a sponge so I need a little more absorbency than this towel provides. Overall, I would say to give this towel a try. There's a reason why it has got so many good reviews.",4
"The Thermal Creations hair dryer is honestly the first DIFFERENT dryer I have every owned. It has a constant cool setting (which I have never had), a warm setting and a hot setting and switches between them effortlessly and immediately. It also has a cold shot button for finishing touches. It has a FABULOUS low setting that is a bit stronger than average and a high setting that is SUPER quick for drying my daughter's straight hair. The COOL setting is PERFECT for my wavy hair. I try to let my hair dry naturally during the warmer months, but for winter it just takes TOO long and ordinarily using a blowdryer would cause fluff and frizz, but the COOL and LOW setting on his dryer were PERFECT. I LOVE all the options available and it is light and easy to use. I do miss having a retractable cord on this model, but will enjoy it anyway!Definitely recommended.",5
"Nice natural looking mascara, does not leave any clumps.  Boyfriend loves it because it looks natural.  Brown is the best color for added clean look.",5
"This product is recommended for sensitive skin, which is why I bought it. My daughter and I both are allergic to most soaps and lotions. This stuff contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a very common irritant, and I developed itching and rashes from it after only a couple of uses. Very disappointing. I won't be using it again.",1
"With the right color match, this stuff is great. It adds volume and thickness to my hair. I didn't buy because of balding. I bought it to make my hair appear much thicker in the front and it did the job. However, the color has to be right. I think the lighter color on the dark hair is gonna look like dust. So, darker color is better than lighter. I can tell because I dye my hair light brown and now I have roots showing. So, I got light brown color. Wherever it matches the color, it's virtually unnoticeable, but wherever the darker roots are showing, it looks like dust on them. But over all, it's great. I still can move my hair around and I love the volume.",5
I work in a hot kitchen 8-9 hours a day - This stuff makes my eye makeup last allll day. I absolutely love it.,5
"Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum is great for giving my hair a shiny, finished look without being over-the-top &#34;producty&#34; or greasy.  I like the texture, the scent, and the ease of use!",4
"I was initially introduced to this product through my purchases of the Clairol's Natural Instincts hair color, a 1 oz sample (called color treat) is included with the hair color and I loved the instant softness that this product provided to my hair. I am AA and I have thick (4A/B) relaxed hair, you apply this product after you have colored your hair and also as a maintenance product to help maintain your color and as an intensive conditioning treatment. I have never been able to achieve such softness as far as conditioning unless I apply a conditioning product, apply a plastic cap and sit under my hair dryer for 30 minutes or more; this is one of those products that can achieve those same results in a shorter period of time or if you are short on time and still desired that deep moisturized effect. When I first used this product, I immediately returned to the store to see if it could be purchased separately and I was not able to find it in any of the local grocery or drug stores, I then searched on line and came across the Clairol's nice'n'easy intensive treatment and this product provides the exact same results as the color treat (obviously because they're both made by Clairol), I am in love with the product, and will be purchasing much more of it. I do wish that the company would distribute the product in a larger container such as in a 16 oz bottle or tube. The product is reasonably priced and Amazon in my experience has always provided excellent customer service and I promptly received this item within 5 days of ordering it. This is a product that will be a staple item in my hair regiment.  I would give this product a 5+ but because of the 1.96 oz tube that it comes in I am giving in a 4 because I would like it in a larger container, come on Clairol listen to your consumers!!!!",4
"I've been using this serum now for a few weeks and really love it. It is light weight and non-greasy, so my skin doesn't feel oily after I apply it. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter. I like the drop top applicator as well - it makes it easy to control how much you are using... just a few drops go a long way. I like that it helps to repair and protect against sun damage, and fades sun spots too. Overall a great, high quality product!",5
"Very chalky and powdery, was not happy or impressed with it, I think this pallet is best used for teens starting out with make-up or want to play around with make-up styles and practice techniques. Sorry but did not like at all.",1
"This has been a perfect brush for applying foundation - works well with both liquid and powder!  Maybe it's the flat top that does it.  Nonetheless, it holds the proper amount of foundation and distributes it smoothly and evenly.Easy to wash clean and the thick wooden handle is good for gripping - plus the bristles don't fall out!Disclosure:  Sample was sent by the manufacturer.",5
"Considering the low price, this is an excellent curling iron. It gets warm quickly and works well with both fine and thick hair. Its sturdy so it should hold up for a quite a while. When we used it the curls held up for all night, with the help of a little hair spray. Using spray with the iron didn't cause any burning. There was no frizz and it doesn't seem to damage my hair.",5
This brush is great! It smooths my hair and takes away the fuzz I used to get with other blow dryer brushes. I did not have the problem of my hair getting pulled or ripped out while using this product. This brush cut my drying time by 10 minutes and makes it a lot easier to straigten with my flat iron. It takes some time and cordination to get use to holding the brush with one hand and the blow dryer in the other; but once you do it's smooth sailing.,5
"Well, not sure this is the right pomade for me with short straight hair but I figured what the hey I'll give it a try.  Actually wasn't too bad, kind of a runny pomade but I only used a little.  Holds decent enough for me and actually did better controlling my fly-away cowlicks than some other pomades I use.  But, makes my hair look a bit too greasy for my tastes so I'll stick with my normal Paul Mitchel Teatree pomade (plus my Paul Mitchel is one of few pomades that I've found don't irritate my forehead skin over time).So I will not add this Motions Pomade to my regular stable of hair products but I did think it performed decently and at $17 a decent price so 4-stars from me based upon price/value.",4
"i swear by eyeshadow primer, and i have to say this is the best one. i could fall asleep and my makeup would still be on my face. its a mush have.",5
"I recently got to try Azure Naturals Ultimate Vitamin C Skin Repair Serum for free for my honest review. Azure Naturals uses natural and organic ingredients whenever possible.  The company says that the serum will renew cells in your skin by boosting the production of collagen and elastin.  It is safe for all skin types and conditions. They boast that they are 100% guaranteed to be the fastest working and most effective vitamin  serum on the market, and that you should see optimal results after 30 days of consistent use.As the company suggested I used the vitamin  serum with the hyaluronic moisturizer, and the ultimate retinol. I have been using it for a little under a month. I do notice that my skin is soft and clear. I may notice some reduction of the fine lines on my forehead. I'm not sure if it's my wishful thinking, but I do know that my skin feels healthy and moist. I'm looking forward to seeing the results after a longer period of time.This product is made in the USA and has a 1 year money back guarantee if you don't love the product they will give you a full refund including shipping. Now isn't that a great incentive to spend the money? There's essentially no risk.",4
"This is great for my elbows and heels. I find it a bit to heavy for my face, but my body loves it. It is a thicker oil and is highly moisturizing. It take a little longer to absorb and a little goes a very long way. This bottle will last a very long time. I expected it to have a horrible smell for some reason, but here is no offensive odor. Actually barely a scent at all. It has been really great on my cuticles as well.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review",5
I have been looking for the right brush for my tangle prone hair for years and i am thrilled by how well this brush works!  The massaging bristles are awesome and I love the natural look and feel of the brush. I had read other positive reviews on amazon before purchasing and am happy to report they are all accurate.,5
"I was a little nervous ordering this light as I read some of the negative comments others made. However, the professional UV light was way out of my price range so I ordered this one. I am so happy with the purchase! Thank goodness I did not listen to the negative comments. The light did come with the bulbs. I was a little scared to put them in as I was unsure of how hard I had to press to put them in. I did plug it in a couple times and it did not turn on, but that is because I did not press the lights in properly.Once I got them in it was smooth sailing. I use it bi-weekly on myself and my family and friends. No problems what so ever. Now I am saving so much money doing no chip manicures myself. For anyone wondering I use the gellish brand in the no chip and it is amazing.",5
I purchased this conditioner along with the shampoo for brightening silver/platinum blonde hair. My hair had some brassy tones which I disliked and this shampoo and conditioner certainly corrected that. The brassiness is gone - it is now more silver/platinum.,4

"So far so good. It really gives off a high shine and dries within a minute or so. It wasn't gloopy or anything like people have described before, no shrinkage or yellowing. I find that it works best with Essie polish. It has the same effect with other polishes but it chips a lot faster with other brands.",4
"I had very dull, dry hair. I used to go to the salon to get it colored every 8 weeks or so, and it was very expensive. I now use WEN (to &#34;wash&#34; it) and this to color it. Looks very shiny and healthy now. For the price, this is a great product.",5
"This makes my hair silky, shiny and so soft.  Products like this are really amazing as they can totally change the look of your hair for a small price.This is easy to use and the results are wonderful.  The only thing that bothers me is the scent!  To me, it's a bit musky/earthy and it's hard for me to put this on my hair.  I'm sorry, it's hard for me to describe the scent... It's not a strong scent, but I can smell it throughout the day and it bothers me.  Which makes me sad because I love how my hair looks and feels when I use this.",3
"I really love this product! The first time I used it I couldn't believe how soft my hair was -- softer than it has ever been. I like the idea of doing a healthier cleasing of my hair. Don't be surprised when you don't get all those suds like regular shampoos -- this product doesn't have all those chemical things in it that make suds, but it still will clean your hair. It's true that it is kind of on the pricey side, but if you figure the additional cost of a conditioner on top of buying shampoo, perhaps it isn't so bad when this product does both jobs. I don't use as many pumps of the product as Wen suggests; I just put a few on the sides, top, and back and then really work it in. I let it stay on my hair until I'm done with my shower and then I rinse it out well. My hair comes out soft, shiny, and managable. I like ordering it through Amazon because then Wen doesn't set you up for those automatic shipments.",5
I love these and need to order a few more as they are a huge help when doing your nail painting,5
I found this scrub refreshing for my adult acne prone skin.  It has a pleasant smell but that is not over powering.  It washes off easily leaving my skin feeling refreshed and soft.,3
I had to add this set to my collection of plates. The price is good considering that Konad plates are about $6 for just 1 plate. I love knowing that I can do my own nails and not have to pay someone else to do them. I think these designs are very pretty; glad I found these.,4
"I have been coloring my hair for over ten years and my stylist recommends I use B&B; products for at least the first couple of weeks after she colors my hair.  I have fine hair but *lots* of it so it's really thick and bushy.  This treatment helps weigh it down a little without making it flat and lifeless.I get in the shower, wash my hair, use a good handful of this conditioner, brush it through my hair, then put my hair up and take a bath.  It smells great and feels like a real spa treatment to ""deeeply"" condition my hair while I take a hot bath.The only thing I would improve about it is it's de-tangling ability.  My hair tangles very easily, especially when wet, and it's hard to brush this through my hair sometimes.  Yet, It is so much softer, healthier-looking, and manageable that I believe this is still a 5-star product.A word on price: Ouch, it's expensive, but if you use the recommended amount, once a week, it will last quite a while.",5
It's perfect for what I'm doing. Easy to cut and shape. It's will not break and it is not too thin. Would buy again.,5
"I like the smell, sweet and fresh and light. I've tried other brands and this one is a great value. Lots of product in there. It does leave a white cast on my black hair that I have to brush out a little more than with the suave brand. It works very well to get oil out but compared to suave it dulls the shine more. I'd stick with suave if it didn't smell so bad and dissappear out of the can so quickly. I probably won't buy this one again though.",4
"Not long ago I visited my daughter and 16 year old granddaughter in the UK. Among the things that I noticed in their bathroom were some Simple skin care products, so I was interested to see some of the Simple line available to test, particularly since I had not long ago run out of the skincare products I have used for some time, the ones that come in the pink box.  So, let me tell you what I had to work with.  (It wasn't pretty!)I've noticed ever since menopause came my way that my face had become dryer and dryer, to the point that it felt like an outing flannel nightgown and definitely showed my age.  Almost nothing has done the first thing to improve the situation - at least until last week.I've been using the following products for a week, twice a day, except for theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrub -- 5 fl oz, which I have been using every other day in the morning.Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)Simple Soothing Facial Toner, 6.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 OunceYou can just color me impressed!  I look years younger.  My face no longer feels like outing flannel but is soft & moist, my wrinkles are much less apparent and my skin has a healthy glow I haven't seen in some time.I'm even more impressed by Simple's commitment to their customers.  All of their products are non-comedogenic (meaning that they won't clog your pores) and none of their products contain dyes, harsh irritants or artificial perfumes (I have very bad reactions to those.)  Everything is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested, some have no scent at all and Simple provides full information about everything that they put into each product right on their website (Simpleskincare dot com) where you can also sign up to the Simple VIP program which includes a monthly newsletter, coupons and other special offers.  You'll find lots of skincare advice there too.Better yet, Simple is multi-generational.  I happened to be chatting with my granddaughter the night this arrived (she has the most gorgeous complexion!) so when she asked what I was up to I told her I was testing some skin care products from the Simple line.  ""OMG Gram!  I love that stuff!"" she exclaimed. OMG - I love that stuff too!Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounceis scent free.  It contains Vitamin B5, known to soften, smooth and restore skin, Vitamin E to moisturize your skin, glycerin to hydrate and nourish along with borage seed oil to help moisturize. Only a very small amount, less than a spot the size of a dime, is needed to moisturize both  your face and neck.Grandma's $0.02 - There's a reason that Simple is the UK's #1 selling line of skin care products. I love what they've done for my skin and am delighted to see them on this side of the pond.  Highly recommended!",5
"The dotting side works perfectly fine, but the brush sucks! Definitely not worth almost $7.00. It does not clean excess polish very well because the hairs are too brittle. It's uneven, which means you cant paint tips because it does not clean up good. I think I would have rather paid a little more money for something better than this. Would not recommend.",2
"When they named this lipstick ""Perfect Red"" they weren't lying.  It's deep, rich, and goes on like velvet.  I am a pale person who loves red and getting the right red with any girls skin tone is difficult but I have found it next to impossible.  Either they are too bright, too dark, too coral, too pink ect. ect.  I love this color.  I love that it's matte.  Shiny red is nice but I love the understated look of matte.  I can't say it's for everyone but for me it truly is the perfect red. Enough I am buying 2 more tubes.",5
"I have shoulder length bleached blonde hair. Oily roots and normal/dry ends. This product smells AMAZING like cotton candy. It can be tricky to use, learning the right amount of product to use takes a few tries. Personally I cannot spray it directly on hair, I have to spray a LITTLE on hands,  rub together, and apply to section of hair I'm using hot tool on. When I first do my hair it is left looking oily but after an hour or so the product ""dries"" and my hair is left soo soft and extremely shiny! It does get hair pinstraight when using a flat iron. The saying a little goes a long way is definitely true about this product. Overall this is a product worth trying because it is so cheap.",4
"Like the Clear brand conditioners that I have tried, this shampoo is lightly scented and the scent is pleasant. The shampoo lathers up well and rinses easily and thoroughly from the hair. This shampoo does a good job at cleansing the hair. Overall, a good product and I would recommend it.",4
"I really thought I was going to love this conditioner because it is designed for fine, flat hair and the bottle says ""enjoy beautifully bouncy and moisturized hair, full of natural volume.""  My hair is fine and long and is flat to wavy but will curl on its own if left to air dry or in rainy weather.This conditioner goes on like any other conditioner.  It smells really nice and after applying to my wet hair, it was easy for me to run a comb through my hair.  Therefore, it has all the properties I'm looking for in the shower.  However, after my hair was dry, it felt somewhat conditioned but was on the flat side so that was disappointing.  I actually like theDove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounceso much better as a conditioner. (The link to my review for this conditioner is in the comments section of this review for those who are interested.)Personally, the results I got with this Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner for fine, flat hair would not encourage me to purchase this product.  The results are just not WOW enough for me.",3
"This is not a &#34;pure&#34; argon oil, but it is the closest thing to it without spending a lot more.  I had done some damage to my hair when coloring the last time, and this really helped to get my hair back in shape.  It does not leave my feeling oily or greasy and smells great.",5
"Great product that does exactly as it says. I have sensitive skin, but with your normal oily T zone. I also wear tubing mascara and all-day shadow which can be hard to remove. One pump of this and some warm water after massaging it in, and nothing is on. Face is clean but not tight with zero residue. This is non-foaming but your skin feels very fresh. This size bottle will last you a few months if you use it once to twice a day.",5
"I am a lazy person when it comes to styling hair. I have fine hair that is naturally curly, but lately I've wanted to wear it straight so looking for something that makes it fuller and wavy, not curly. These are amazingly cheap, but the best velcro (self roller non heated) I've ever used. I dry my hair most of the way (finger dry) use a brush to separate sections, spray a little Kenra Styling spray and roll it up. I then use my blow dryer for about two minutes over all of the rollers and let it set for a couple of minutes before I take out. I have gotten compliments on my hair every day I use these. I use the larger Pink ones and the neon green only (the rest are a little small). I am going to buy another set to get more pink. I also think the smaller ones are harder to roll out of my hair (you never want to PULL).One thing I just realized. I guess the colors can vary per package.",4
"I LOVE this powder! It has always been my go - to choice of makeups. I am not a fan of using liquid foundation - and this is the perfect solution! I use a light moisturizer on my face before applying, and once it dries, then I apply the powder. It looks fantastic and treats my skin VERY well.  I will be a life-long customer!",5
This is good shampoo. I use shampoo for hand washing clothing and for bathing - body wash hurts my skin but not shampoo.  The price is excellent with subscribe and save.,4
I was pretty excited to get these. I thought they would be small. And I wouldn't be using as much acetone since it was in a concentrated little area. Well I got them and they are pretty big. I have to use quiet a bit of acetone to fill them to where my whole nail is in there. It's a good idea in theory but it's not for me.,2
Its okay.. I feel that it retains on my lid If I put too much or enough product. So I always have to try to put little to not crack out. I would not recommend this one.,3
"I get the WORST stains on my nails from dark nail polish. This base coat is a life saver for me. I use it whenever I wear a dark polish. My manicures will last a bit longer when I use this as well, but it's nothing incredible. It probably adds a day or two to the lifetime of my manicure.",4
"This spray seems to work well for everyone in my family (not just the men). Still, it's nice to have a formula that works well under high-impact conditions.",4
"i bought this the other day because for the first time in my life, i have dandruff. i'm not sure why it took 35 years for me to develop this problem, but hopefully this shampoo will always work like it has been for the past couple weeks. after exactly one use, my scalp felt so much better that i didn't mind the smell. it definitely smells like you'd think coal tar would smell: i told my boyfriend i smelled like an asphalt plant and, being the heavy equipment operator he is, he clarified that i do not smell like an asphalt plant but rather, a coal miner on a lunch break. so sweet, that guy.  but i digress...i was hoping for a stronger menthol, tingly, cooling sensation than what i got, but it doesn't really matter anymore because my itchy, red, angry scalp is calm now. i'm pretty impressed. i used it on my patches of extremely irritated skin and it most definitely calmed the itch on those as well, but then i smelled really strongly of the tar. the smell is so strong that i am sure some people would be afraid to use it but if your scalp is itchy enough, it's totally worth the smell. and if you shower at night, the smell is gone by morning. would recommend.",5
I believe this has really helped me to get a hold of my middle age acne.  I use this once a week in conjunction with the Image vital C hydrating mask and finish with the Image daily matte moisturizer.,5
"They're just basic brushes to do fine art with. The material isn't the highest of quality but not the lowest. Luckily I received the products undamaged, as I know shipping from another country can sometimes be rough. Other than that, these were a better bang for your buck than going to a craft store for the same quality.",3
"I'm loving these simple eye make-up remover cloths. They're so much easier to use than liquid eye make-up remover, and they don't burn my eyes with excess liquid like I'm used to. I can use two or three for both eyes, so this pack has lasted me a while (though I don't do eye make-up every day). I highly recommend using these over the messy liquid remover. I'm very pleased.",5
"IBD quickly became my favorite soak off gel polish brand for the salon. It wears wonderful, soaks off clean, and shines for weeks on end. This blue is a classic dark blue with a metallic shimmer. Not glitter.",5
These mini's are great. Great for starting up on brush collection. Perfect for travel but also nice to keep in makeup up drawer. Brisles are soft but dense. Would purchase these again.,5
"I have been going &#34;no 'poo&#34; for about a year now but had problems with itchiness and dandruff.  This completely solved that problem, and it smells great.  Try it!!!",5
"Product did not work for me I saw no results AT ALL, ive been going for 1 week and 4days..5 times and this IS only a moisterizer, not am accelerator",1
It gave me some split ends which i trimmed off and it made my hair look good some what I guess but it wasn't good for it at all. It dried my hair out. It's long and curly and I'm growing it longer so obviously i dont wanna be trimming 24/7. Go to L'oreal if you're looking for something that's good to you. God bless all.,2
"Color is beautiful- rich dark purple, goes on smoothy and has a nice shine.  Shade is perfect for any season but especialy now-going into fall",5
"I'm new to fake lashes but since these were so cheap, I thought &#34;Why Not?&#34;.They shipped surprisingly very fast. Once I got them, I tried them on. They went on easily and were fine. Definitely not a natural look but I can make them work on special occasions .",4
"Some people can't tolerate the chemical sun screens, so for those people, this may be an option.  The active ingredients in this product are titanium dioxide 8% and zinc oxide 3.8%.The cream looks tan and opaque as it comes out of the tube and I worried it would look funny on my face but it does blend in and you can't see it.My complaint is how it feels.  I don't like the way it feels on my face.  I was expecting it to soak in more but I touch my face and it feels greasy.  I'm going back to the more typical sun screens.",2
"In my years of using nail polish, this is the best I have ever used.  I am so relieved and delighted!I recommend it to everyone I know.  T'is wonderful!!",5
L'Oreal products don't disappoint me.  I have discovered I like the mineral brush on products and the cheek blush is just great.,5
and I will say it again! I will never use another product other than EzFlow. It has been my all time easiest perfected product that I have ever found!,5
Has very little scent.  Left my hair shiny. I thought it could use a touch more moisturizing ability.  Makes my naturally wavy hair very wavy and my thick hair even bigger which I don't care for.  When I used it with the John Masters shampoo for dry hair I developed build up.  When I used it with another brand it was too drying.  When I used it after I colored my hair it was just right.  So I Only Use it for conditioning after coloring my hair.,3
"this machine works extremely well. Every nail tech should have one. I love it!! Dont search any further, buy now!",5
Amazing way to fade away scars. I have a fairly new scar and as expected it has started to fade. What really surprised me was the way it had turned my scar from 6 years ago close to invisible! Glad I ordered.,5
I really liked this blow dryer. I was able to straighten my granddaughters hair with the concentrator. Also I love that she can dry her usually curly hair without it frizzing using the diffuser. I have had blow dryers with Ion technology before but they did not compare to this one. Also the size and weight of this dryer make it is easy to handle and use with no problem. The combination of settings makes any style possible. It gets very hot but can still shoot a burst of cool hair at the push of a button. It Is  definitely salon quality. The only down sides to this dryer is the hang loop is smaller than others that I have had and it blows with such force that you have to be carefully not to get your hair to close to the back of the dryer. It sucked  a piece of mine into it and it was painful.,5
"yes, it heats up, but the heat dial and on/off switch are constantly turned down or turned off due to their location.  Would look at other brands before purchasing.",2
"I do enjoy these makeup remover cloths, they do what they are intended to do. The design in the cloths tends to feel rough at times, when I scrubbing makeup off my face. These cloths last quite a bit of time.",4
great brushes with a range of sizes. good for fine detail on images. These are good quality. you wont be disapointed. Try  these out.,5
"I love this stuff!! I have been doing my own manicures for years, and the regular use of this has greatly strengthened my nails!",5
"These work Great! The fan brush was a little rough looking upon opening but that's not a brush I use anyway. And I love the purple brush tips. They look really cool and everything matches. Very good deal and very cheap, although these probably need more frequent replacing than an expensive set.",5
"I like Tresemme products, but this is absolutely the best. It is a thin white cr&egrave;me, but your hair feels so clean and soft and for a longer period of time than with other shampoos. The fragrance is somehow like an old fashioned scent, it reminded me of a shampoo my grandmother used to use, sort of like a sweet soapy smell.My hair is about 8"" below my shoulders and was a bit tangled when I shampooed and I decided to see how this did without using conditioner and it was just like I had conditioned it. So it is also gentle, but yet strong enough to give your hair a good cleaning.",5
"When I hit puberty and started getting breakouts, my mom gave me this to start using daily. I used it as a toner, applying this with a cotton ball after washing my face. It has a great lemon smell, and it didn't dry out or irritate my skin at all. It removed a lot of dirt, excess oil, and makeup. It certainly helped a lot with my blemishes.",5
"Normally I'm nearly always thrilled at the beauty products I buy on amazon.  This was not the case with this product.  Instructions state to put on lashes and let dry fully before you apply mascara.  So I did just that, a good 1/2 hour before.  It clumps my lashes together and actually the mascara doesn't seem to last as long.  It actually looks like I have less lashes and thinner at that.  So I tried it again for the next several days, maybe I need more, or less, or more at the tips, or at the base.  After many different levels of application, I came to the conclusion that this simply doesn't work at all.  I tossed it and my lashes look better with the MAC false lash mascara alone.  Don't bother, it's not like it cost very much, but it was a dissapointment.",1
"I am still on the search for a good drugstore product but lemmie tell you...THEY SUCK! The only one I will EVER continue buying is Tresseme conditioner (without silicone) it says avocado and something else, I forget. I love the smell of it and it's detangles SO GOOD! I have wavy/curly hair/frizzy and drugstore products do not work on me! I find when I use highend products, I can wash and go without damaging my hair with tools and products!ANYWAYS, back to Dove. At first I loved the smell and how it felt but after a few uses, my hair looks dull and it doesn't detangle like it did! I don't use this everyday...I wash my hair every 2-3 days and sometimes I don't shamppoo but this product I use here and there when I feel like it and I am almost done with it and I will NOT repurchase EVER. I do love dove soap bars though, and I will repurchase those till I die.",3
I will never use emery boards again. This file helps prevent split nails & can be cleaned by a quick run under water. Just be careful because they break easily(of course!).,5
"Love Thayer's witch hazel.  But ordered the Lavender by mistake, not my favorite scent in the world.  It works fine, just wish I had the scent free, alocohol free version.",3
This product works great for my purpose. The size is nice because it will last a long time and it was cheaper on Amazon than any where else.,4
"This only worked for half of my head. :( Had I known, I would have ordered two packs.Note: I have thick hair.Other than that, the hair itself is gorgeous!",4
"I like a hair dryer with a brush attachment.  I also like the brush to be very stiff.  This dryer satisfies both requirements. There are few choices except for this one.  It comes with 2 comb attachments which I never use, I only use the brush.  It is either on or off.  Would like to see a less hot setting.The problem with it is that the brush wont stay on while drying my hair.  the plastic brush attachment snaps into place.  It keeps slipping or popping off when drying my hair.  This make the dryer close to useless.  I will probably have to epoxy the brush to the body to keep it in place.  I would imagine its the same problem with the comb attachments as they are identical bodies.",1
"So ladies, we do our nails and then go to sleep.  Stupid, we all know it, yet we still do it and wake up with blanket ridges.  I kid you not, I only bought this to make the 25 for free shipping.  I used Sally Hansen qwik dri and it was super oily and didn't really dry my nails.  I'm AMAZED that after my last coat (top coat) I add 2 drops per nail after 1 minute and they are dry to the touch immediately.  Completely dry minutes there after.  I've tested the mani/pedi before bed with these drops and do the check every morning and WOW.  no more telling yourself you'll sleep with your hands perfectly still on top of your blanket.  Yea....ok. Buy this now.",5
"Look at this cute pink cosmetic Train Case With Mirror.OMG! Any women would love this cute little pink train case. The built in mirror is great too ..great gift for your friend, girlfriend, nieces and so much fun!",5
I am absolutely in LOVE with Its a 10 Products!! I have been using them for over a year now and I get so many compliments on how great my hair looks and no split ends!,5
"Glides on like water ladies, and stays put allllllllll day long! No kidding.  I will never use another black pencil as long as these are available.  Good job Amazon!",5
I love how this lathers and how great I feel after using it. This soap is WOW! I love it. I feel squeeky clean after using it in the shower and a little goes a long way. The smell isn't all that but it goes away and does not linge ron the skin so I like that as well. My skin feels softer:),5
"I don't use this product for the age-defying aspect. I thought this was a relatively cheap product that was all natural, and so far I really like it. I only give it 4 stars because I haven't noticed any &#34;age defying&#34; aspects, but it has kept my eyes hydrated. I have normal eyelids, but the skin around my under eye is pretty dry, and this has helped to keep that area hydrated.",4
"Every single mascara, no matter how expensive, smudges on me and leaves me with raccoon eyes an hour after applying it. I ordered this after doing some research and reading that a primer might help to stop that. I ordered it but didnt have high hopes as I thought I was doomed to be a raccoon forever...I received this and my first impression was that it wouldnt work as I could barely see it on my lashes but this thing WORKS! I am able to wear any mascara from the cheapest drugstore brand to the most expensive brand and NO SMUDGES!! I will never be without this!",5
"I am about 5 months pregnant.  Although the product arrived on time and not damaged, I must admit that I'm not entirely fond of it.  It is quite greasy-not matter how little you use-and I haven't noticed a change in my skin, nor stretch marks since starting application of this butter.Would probably not purchase again, unless the product suddenly starts working.  I bought this a few months ago-still haven't seen any changes whatsoever.  Hope someone else has better luck than I do...-Hannah",4
As a shampoo it works well. It foams which I like but doesn't dry out your scalp too much. It seems to work as well as any other foaming shampoo I have bought.,4
"This is certainly a top-line shampoo, and it works very well, but I still have yet to find the ""one"" shampoo that my hair loves in return. The smell is unique (very minty), and there is a definite improvement even after the first use. I still need more shine and moisture, though... but I have very tough hair. For the average person's hair, I would totally recommend this shampoo",4
Bought these as extras and they work great. Nice and small case so it doesn't take up a lot of space.,5
"I love Skin Obsession products, TCA peel and others peel, but this peel made me break out. I tried it twice and each time my face was bumpy. versus me using the TCA peel or the glycolic peel. I like the shipper products",3
I like the blue holder to hold you're eyelash and applying the glue.  I'm still terrible at getting these darn things on so this helps me a little.,4
I used this for years and then stopped for a while to use more natural product but that was a mistake! Six months later and I had a bevy of tiny wrinkles around my eyes. Went back to Olay and I am happy to say the state of wrinkles are back to where they were - much reduced! People always think I am at least 10 years younger than I am. Enough said.,5
"My son loves Axe products, so I ordered AXE SHOWER GEL DEEP SPACE for him. Of course, I had to try it as well. I was expecting it to have a powerful fragrance, with a manly smell, which is not the case, and a pleasant surprise. Several of the Axe products I have smelled were overpowering, producing the opposite affect I imagine they intended it too. Anytime I encounter a person who has such a powerful scent, I have to wonder what they are attempting to hide. The gel itself is milky in color with a shin to it. While lathering, you can feel the little bead like contents that provides a mild scrubbing action. The fragrant last for a time, but not for long, which can be a plus if you don't care for it to clash with your perfume or cologne. However, I don't buy into the statement that someone would attract the opposite sex due to using this product. Of course anytime someone smells good, and is clean, is a plus as appose to the opposite.",4
Have used this for years.  I use it in the sun and feel very moisturized after.  It makes skin smell wonderful.,5
"I love this top coat, dries my nails very quick, leaving a silky smooth finish, keeping my nail polish looking just painted for over a week!!! One thing I didn't like was it got all goofy half way gone, but found out about adding a drop or two of finger nail polish remover or buying their own brand just put a couple drops in and it's like I just bought it!!! I used to never put on top coats, but the past year or more been getting into trying different designs and stamping and this was my choice for top coat, I've never used anything else and never will!!!!! Very happy with this top coat, regardless of what chemicals are in it, I'm not eating it or sniffing it, so I'm sure it's not going to kill me or cause any health issues, maybe if I were to sniff it everyday to get high or ingest it, I'm sure it's safe, or people would already be getting sick by now. All these polishes have some type of chemicals in it, all which are not good to sniff on purpose or ingest, not sure anyone would want to ingest this!! Lol.. Just be careful, do nails in an open area. I'm sure they have to put that on the label, make people aware of what's in it.. Just my 2 cents.. :)",5
"This works so well to control and fix my calluses on my feet and ankles.  It's the only thing I've found that works on taking care of the stubborn, tough, dry skin on my feet.  I just rub some into the skin and then put on a pair of heavy socks.  My skin is vastly improved in the morning.",5
"This product does a great job smoothing frizzy hair and adding a bit of shine, but silicone is one of the main ingredients so you'll want to use it sparingly.I love the scent - it smells ""green"", like fresh-cut grass.  My hair falls about 3"" past my shoulders and I find that slightly less than a pea-sized amount is more than enough product to get the job done.  First rub your hands together to emulsify the cr&egrave;me then work into WET hair from mid-shaft through to the ends.  I would not recommend applying to the root area as it can weigh the hair down.  Blow dry as usual.  It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and frizz-free, with a touch of shine.  You can also apply it when the hair is dry, though I find that it weighs my hair (which is on the ""fine"" textured side) down and leaves it too ""flat"" looking.Some things to keep in mind:*May not be suitable for very fine or thinning hair*Strong fragrance (I think it smells great, but you may not agree!)*Contains silicone which can coat the hair; some hair stylists recommend limiting or avoiding silicone-based hair care products*A little goes a long way!  Overuse can leave the hair flat or even greasy lookingBottom Line:  I don't generally like silicone-based hair products, but this smoothing cr&egrave;me is going to be a handy weapon to have in my hair care arsenal once the humid weather rolls around - it's effective at taming those annoying frizzies.",4
"Not only are these practical, but they're also good at what they do and I love how all of them has a brush guard so when I'm not using them, they're protected in some way. I also love that I don't need to buy these at Sally's beauty for a fraction of the cost, I can just order them and I have plenty of uses for each of these brushes. I have had no problems ever since I got them and I will continue purchasing from this user. &#60;3.",5
"I have very curly hair and I am always stuck putting a bunch of junk in my hair to keep my hair from getting frizzy and to define my curls.  I took a chance and tried this, and am so glad I did.  To start off I pumped quite a bit in my hand expecting to need a lot.  Well you don't.... A little goes a long way.  I can use just this alone and have perfect curls with no greasy residue or crunchy hair.  It definatly stands up to it claim of being as good as Redkin if not better, plus the price is great.  I also have noticed my hair feels very moisuruzed after using this product.",5
"Some reviewers question the list of ingredients, but most facial washes have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients. Just because they sound weird, doesn't make them bad. So unless you're a chemist or a dermatologist, don't assume that it's bad.At least one reviewer gave the product bad marks because you can't put it around your eyes. Lots of facial soaps/cremes make similar warnings. That doesn't make this a lousy product. It's not called, ""Eye cleaner"" or ""Eye moisturizer."" It's for the face. While the eyes are part of the face, it's a special part that is super sensitive, which is why there are special products just for that.Overall, this product is quite good and delicate. Is it the best thing ever? No, but I'm happy with it and probably most people would be too.",4
This brush keeps my longish hair from tangles even while drying at the roots. This is a plus for my hair. It works better than some more expensive brushes I have used. My hair stylist who turned me on to thi brush. Love it. It also speeds up the drying process.,5
Just like the pics that I've seen. Great holo at a great price. Gives off the different color hues that stand out in and out of the sunlight.,5
I love makeup and have tried many high end products out there! This is one of the best products and for the price you can't go wrong! I've been recommending this to everyone! It has a natural look. It does go on a bit grey as others mentioned but fixes itself. Great product for the price!,5
"I really love the smell, and it is not like the other product, it is not sticky but it can hold the shape for a long time, almost a day&#62;",5
"I bought this after I used Loreal's new Healthy Look Cr&egrave;me Gloss in Black Gloss.  The package says it's not permanent hair color and will wash out after 28 shampoos.  I'm normally a red head and thought black would be fun for a month.  And it was fun for that month.  But by week 8 I was ready to have my natural color back.  I tried everything -dish soap, ivory soap, baking soda, vitamin c tablets, vinegar, coconut oil, praying to the hair gods.  Nothing worked, it wouldn't even lighten it.  Finally after 5 months I found Color Oops Hair Color Remover.  My hair is still not back to normal, but it's 85% there.  I can live with that.  Now to figure out what to do with the other package of Healthy Look Cr&egrave;me Gloss....",5
"I thought i was doing a good job washing my face, but this product makes your face really flawless and clean. will order in the future",5
"This product does work great for keeping hair healthy with hot iron and dryer use. I highly recommend it. When it comes to shampoo and conditioner, however, I would go with Pantene's Keratin Repair over the shampoo and conditioner by Organix, which I found, conversely, to dry my hair too much.",5
"For the record, I've never used mascara in my life and have no intention of doing so. However, my wife wanted me to order this AINHOA Passion Mascara through Vine, so I got it for her. Here's what she said about it:* The brush is nicely shaped and it's stored in a cute silver bottle* It's not messy or clumpy when the wand is pulled out of the tube* It goes on easy and has good volume, but it flakes off by the end of the workday",3
I have used Neutrogena Alcohol-free Toner for quite a while.  it doesn't dry your skin out and is very refreshing to your face.,5
Its really good for asians because of the color selection it has. A little goes a long ways and I feel like its not too soft so it doesn't apply too much. Its gives very natural brows,5
This product does not hold your ends down.  You will be replacing it every hour.  Leaves a white sticky residue.,1
"I bought Wen Sweet Almond Mint because so many people (on here) said great things about it. I really didn't care for it. Keep in mind that all hair types are different and different things work for different people. That being said, my hair is pretty thick, medium length and dry. My hair is the type where the longer you wait to wash it, the more tame and beautiful it becomes, until it starts to get greasy at the roots. So I thought Wen would be perfect for me; conditioning with just enough cleanser.  I used it how it says to and I was not impressed. My hair was pretty limp and weird after, like it wasn't really clean, even though I made sure it had been completely washed out. The trick to Wen is that it conditions your hair without harsh chemicals that shampoos use. As far as using cold water, people have been saying that for years about ANY type of shampoo. It's always better to wash with cold. If you are looking for a product like Wen, the best advice I can give you is to wash your hair less frequently and use a conditioner to ""wash"" it in between. So if you are washing everyday, wash every other day and on the days you aren't washing, rinse your hair with conditioner. That helps keep it clean, rinsing out excess dirt, while conditioning it and not putting harsh chemicals in your hair. I hope this review helps! Best of luck! Oh one more thing, the pump seriously sucks. It stopped working for me after the second wash (I still have plenty of product left).I bought this through Amazon, no problems with shipping and the product came quickly!",2

". . . but at first I thought it was a complete waste of money.  What made the difference?  The relaxer!  I was natural when I bought it and was having a very difficult time detangling so I thought I'd make an investment in a high-end hairbrush specially made for detangling.  But it didn't really help at all.  I cleaned it and put it away expecting I'd think of someone with thick or curly (non-black) hair to give it to.  But I eventually got a relaxer, which helped with the horrible issues I'd been having with detangling.  Of course, my hair still tangled (because it's quite wavy/curly), just not as badly, but still a chore.But eventually I remembered my expensive little white MP brush.  I love it now!  It helps me a lot.  I do not use it as directed (it is not supposed to be used with product because certain ingredients aren't good for the rubber) but I need to brush through with product and it's also great for making sure hair evenly coated with treatments.  Anyway, I finger de-tangle, then big tooth comb de-tangle, then the MP detangling brush brings it home.  The result? Truly detangled, un-knotted hair.  Hair that when you detangle, braid, rise or wash and then unbraid, is STILL detangled!  That means fewer single strand knots for me, and just really pleased.  Because it's expensive I would encourage people with black or other ethnic hair to try to get where you can try and maybe return or something (if it doesn't do the trick on your particular head of hair).  Don't bother trying to dry brush using this if you have black hair (in my experience at least).  No 5 rating just because I wish it was a bit bigger and wish it was not so high-maintenance to clean, etc, but it's still a winner for me.  Thanks.*******UPDATE******It's been about 6 months of using this brush and I just tossed it.  The bristles have bent and are falling out.  To be fair, the instructions say that it is not for use in hair that has product in it because oils and the like damage the nylon.  So that means if you brush through with your leave-in product or whatever, as I have, it isn't the intended use.  I will not be replacing it because it doesn't do a special job on my hair dry.  It just doesn't last for the use I found for it . . .",2
I must say it was the universally positive reviews of this product that made me order this cuticle pusher.  I'm sure glad I did.  The pusher side does a perfect job on my cuticles and the curet/spoon part cleans out debris from under my nails and my cuticles.  This is much better than orange sticks.,5
I really like this stuff. I kind of hate the foundations in the bottles. Some are too thick and hard to get out... some are too watery and I accidentally pour too much out. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my skin. Decent coverage. Will buy again.,5
I love this product. I used it constantly but it wasn't what I thought it was because I thought it would be a flat surface but it's not.,5
I now get some other soap and it comes in 3 bars at a time. Cetaphil is a good brand but it is over $6.00 for just one with shipping.,4
"This mascara was pretty disappointing compared to the original Lash Blast. It doesn't really lengthen the way it claims and certainly does nothing for volume. It does darken lashes a bit and separate and define decently. I'd say this product is best saved for ""no makeup"" makeup days (bb cream, this mascara, and lip balm type days). Another use is to save is specifically for bottom lashes. It is actually perfect for bottom lashes since the formula is light and the brush is actually very good for definition. Once your done, I'd suggest saving the brush to apply your favorite formula to bottom lashes. It still has use but not something I'd repurchase.",2
"I live in a very humid part of the country and this conditioner, when I use it with the shampoo, has really helped to tame my hair when the humidity rises. My hair has been so soft and shimy since I started using this. Another thing Imlove is the cost. It is so cheap, and you get so much! The bottle will last you for a long time. How I use this is I put in on my midshaft and ends first then put what's left on my hands on my roots. I flip my head to one side and try to really rub it into the midshaft and ends. Then I run a shower comb through very easy. I twist my hair up and use a large hair claw to keep it up. Then I finish showering while the conditioner is still in my hair. This way it has plenty of time to penetrate the hair cuticle.",5
Loved using this face wash. It is a very good quality wash. It has a great scent. Your face feels very clean and refreshed after using. It also moisturizes and hydrated your face. A reasonably priced wash that smells good and doesn't dry your face out. Will use again.,5
"I got Deep Throat! Better than Orgasm, in my opinion. Orgasm's a little more coral in tone, whereas Deep Throat gave one a very soft, natural pinkish blush. Made me look very nubile, and very much like a sweet young thing.The blush is also lasting, but will wash off in the shower. Feels more premium than MAC though. Everything I want in a blush! :D",5
"This product is pure and seems to be of a very high quality ingredient.  The nourishing vitamin E oil healed my dry, chapped lips in a day and it seems to be helping my scar from a previous burn.  I also mix a few drops of this oil with pure Argan Oil and use it as an everyday lip balm and nighttime lip treatment.  I put it on during the day instead of chapstick when my lips are feeling dry, I apply it before applying lipstick to smooth and protect my lips, and I apply it to clean dry lips and scars each evening before bed as a restorative treatment.  It makes my lips and skin soft and healthy.",5
"I  love the texture of this, like a cross between a tinted moisturizer and a foundation when it goes on.  Sheer but with enough coverage so you look supernatural but better and glowing.  I dust a hint of bareminerals in fairly light over it, best makeup complexion I've ever gotten.  Did get it for way cheaper at the grocery store of all places though, so I'd look around first before buying it here.",4
"I was really excited to test this product.  I'm one of those shampoo/conditioner hoarders.  i have tried almost every brand out there and really can't find one I like.  I have long hair that is very thick and slightly wavy.  When I wash it, it's very difficult to get a comb through even with conditioners.  Lately, I've been hooked on WEN (which I got on Amazon) and it's been working great but I do miss the lather that shampoo provides.I first used this 4 days ago.  I shampooed with one of my ordinary shampoos and then used this and oh my goodness, I have NEVER felt my hair that soft.  It was also easy to comb and smelled great.  The next day, I didnt' wash my hair and it was still soft, and manageable and perfect.  I sometimes have a dry scalp and i noticed a huge difference using this product.  I used it again last night and I got the same results...soft, manageable hair, smelled great and no dry scalp...and my hair was very easy to comb wet.  I can't believe there is a product out there that does this great of a job for my hair.  I will most definitely be buying this conditioner and it will be one of my favorites.  It's thick but very easy to wash out.  I also have a little more bounce to my hair.  If you're like me and have tried product after product and are just not satisfied, try this one.",5
Seems like a lot of money but it is money well spent!  It really does dry brushes overnight enabling me to take great care of my make up tools.,5
i needed something for my hair because it was stringy and dry. this stuff is a miracle. it made my hair smooth and detangled it. don't use to much though because it will make your hair greasy.,5
Great brushes! thank you,5
"My hairdresser warned me about over hydrating my fine oily hair. I heard such good reviews about this product, so I bought it even knowing it could possibly mess up my hair. I've had it several months now, and using it once or twice a week I believe my hair has become softer and less damaged. I use it at night and wash it out the next morning and haven't noticed any more oil that normal even on days after the treatment. My hair really looks best on days after treating, so I may move up my treatments to three or four days a week if I get brave.",4
"even though it makes my hair feel gross. If you use this, you HAVE to wash your hair that night. it got gross up on my pillow and then i broke out. gross.",2
"Very dissapointed in this brand, as I have tried other HCG brands that had virtually no flavor.  I could only tolerate using these drop for about 5 days before stopping.  It literally took all I had just to hold these drops under my tongue due to the extremely foul taste and it burned immensely. I feel like I wasted my hard earned money, especially since I purchased 2 boxes!",1
I have long hair & I curl the ends everyday for work. This curling iron is the perfect size & price!,5
"Very cute! however, hair may get caught between the loops. It does stay in place. But not worth more than a $1",4
"This is a great brush, and you can't beat this price. I actually prefer this brush to my MAC brushes for applying foundation. It works wonders for liquid or cream foundation.It is very soft, and feels great against the skin. It blends foundation nicely, even those hard to blend ones. With certain foundations (YSL especially) I can get a bit of streaking, but nothing that won't eventually blend right out, or be easily fixed with a soft kabuki.I have had the brush about a year now, and have not experienced any shedding. I spot clean with MAC brush cleaner, and then do a full clean with baby shampoo about once a week.I also have the Real techniques stippling brush, and the stippling brush does apply foundation a bit heavier, if you are in need of more coverage, I would recommend looking into that one too.Great price for this quality.",5
"This is great for drier skin, it gets you super clean but still moisturizes your skin. I don't get a tight feeling with either of the soaps but this one is exceptionally moisturizing (=. I have grown to love all of the adovia facial products, they don't make me break out and they don't make me produce excess sebum, winning?!",5
"I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.I do, of course, have my favorites, but the aromatherapy works for each type. This one was truly relaxing and helped my husband sleep better when he used it to help remedy his insomnia. Lovely scent.",5
"I received my 3mm nail studs today in the mail and I am very pleased. They were slightly tricky to navigate into the proper place on my nails. However, after taking time to make sure the first one was perfectly square it was easy to position the rest. Make sure to put a top coat over the entire nail and studs after letting them completely set and dry!",4
"I would describe this lotion as a very simple (""no bells or whistles""), and no miracles, moisturizer.  This very light lotion is great for someone looking just to simply moisturize her/his face without any scents or other long-term benefits/miracles.  It goes on light and non-greasy and is easy to use under make-up.  However, if you are looking for other short-term or long-term benefits, I did not see any after using this for almost a month.  The results were similar to using pure aloe vera gel.  I don't NOT like the lotion, but I don't love it either.",3
This is good for gel. I use and is Amazing with the gel. The gel don't peel and feel hard in the nail,5
You cannot go wrong with a three in one product like this when you have kids. My kids are never thrilled about bathing so anything that lets them get the job done in a shorter amount of time is great in my book. The scent of pineapple is not too strong and leaves their hair smelling fresh and clean. It does a good job of conditioning their hair as well as cleaning it.,5
"This was the first stamper I bought for my intro into nail art stamping I mostly bought it instead of the Konad because I could get it quicker (wanted it for a weekend visit with my little niece) and liked the color better than Konad. Based on the good reviews, I figured it'd be fine.Like most people I was frustrated at first. I'd bought various plates and polishes (Konad and non-Konad on both). Sometimes the image would look good and sometimes not. Usually, the first time was good, but not after that. I watched a lot of Youtube tutorials and couldn't understand what I was doing wrong, I was certain it was possible to get it all to work. Finally, I decided to buy the official double side Konad stamp. Before it arrived I got the MASH stamper to work well, and thought I'd wasted my money on the Konad stamp. Not so. I did many side by side comparison using different plates and polishes, on paper mostly, and I could easily notice a difference in Konad. It was superior to the MASH stamper, and I'm glad I got it.The difference comes from the hardness, or softness, of the rubber. Thick and thin lines in the images will pick up better or worse based on that. You can see this by doing tests using both sides of the stamper. There's much less difference between Konand & MASH on the small ends than the large ends, but for me, I like the full images and you need the larger end for that. So, Konad wins in this area. The large end is less mushy than the MASH stamp. Before I got the konad stamp I hadn't noticed how much of the image was left on the MASH stamper after the transfer to my nail. Most often with Konad nothing is left behind.I did find the MASH plates of excellent quality and left a 5 star review on those. I'll absolutely  buy MASH products again, but if my little dogs eat the MASH stamper it will not be replaced. However, I'm considering buying a back up Konad stamp. That's how much better I found it to be.TIPS:1)Make sure to use pure acetone, and clean the image in between each use. I originally used polish remover with additives for strengthening and that turned out to be one of my major problems in the beginning.2)Turn off any fans you may have causing a draft on your work area. I found leaving my ceiling fan on dramitically reduced the time I had to work. You need time to work on these in the beginning to line everything up right, and you already don't have much time before the the thin layer of polish dries. You need to check the image before applying to ensure it's good, and then time to line it up. At first this is going to be a slower process, which can lead to drying out the image and not getting a good transfer. So, make it easier on yourself and watch your drafs.3)If rolling over the image doesn't work well, try punching straight down and up instead, not hard and not fast, but firmly. I find this method easier, although, I've seen many people online work well with the rolling method.4)Practice and experiment. It takes practice. If you're at the end of your manicure, just play around before taking off your polish.Finally, Konad polishes work well, but there are great cheaper alternatives that are easier to come by. Maybelline Color Show metallics work very well. You can find a ton of tips on Youtube about various polishes that work, but that's one of my favorites. Metallics of most any brand seem to work well. I always test the polish by opening in the store and taking out the brush to let a little slide down the inside of the bottle. You can see how thick and opaque a polish is like that.",3
This product is awesome! I often used it everyday even i stay at home and it's works! tks to loreal,5
"As with most essie shades, it requires two coats for full opacity but it paints on smooth and the polish is very high quality. I love this color for fall/winter and with polka dots, it is great for spring. It is a great cool grey with a hint of tan hues.Would definitely buy again.",4
"This set is amazing! Just throw everything you own out, and buy this! Every single piece is highly pigmented and stays on for hours. You can create thousands and thousands of unique looks with just this set. It is a great gift (and they'll never know how much you didn't spend!). This set really just has it all. I leave it on my makeup table and use it every day. I always say it doesn't matter if its name brand, I just want it to work - and this stuff works! I highly, highly recommend!",5
"I am amazed that this mirror stayed fog free in my hot shower even after 15 minutes. This is what comes in the package:- One mirror with base- LED light on base- Squeegee on side for wiping the mirror if needed- Three suction cups to apply the mirror to the bathroom wall; there's also tape provided if you want to use that instead.  Use one or the other, not both as per the cardboard instructions.- Flexible accessory holder on the base to hold up to 3 razors or other accessories (such as toothbrushes).- The instructions are on both sides of the packaging.The 3 AAA batteries required for the LED light, which is very bright, is not provided. I also needed a teensy-weensy Phillips screwdriver to remove the battery compartment screws.  Other than this screwdriver, no other tools are required.To get the mirror to remain fog-free, the mirror portion has a water reservoir that has to be filled with warm shower water. Since there are weep holes in the reservoir, be prepared to be sprayed in the face with a tiny stream of water while filling. After it was filled, the mirror easily slid onto the base. Although the instructions do not say this, this water reservoir has to be filled every time you take a shower.  The water from the reservoir will leak out eventually through the weep holes by the time a regular shower and shave is completed.What I absolutely love about this mirror is that it remained fog-free for the entire 15+ minute shower. I also loved how well the mirror stuck to my bathroom wall with the suction cups. The LED is incredibly bright which is both a PRO and CON. I was able to see no matter how dark but the mirror had to be at the right level in order for me not to be blinded.  For me that meant I had to put the base of the mirror right about lower-neck / upper-chest level. Since the mirror was securely fastened to the wall, I decided to stand on my tiptoes instead as it had the same effect.The accessory holder is useless to me because it would not fit myGillette Fusion Proglide Men's Power Razor, 1 Countwhich has a bulbous end.  Since I don't like storing my razor nor my toothbrush in the shower, I actually do not care that this accessory holder is useless.  The squeegee, which is lightly secured by clips on the side of the base, is absolutely useless as well.  This does bother me because it would be something I could use should the mirror ever fog up.  The reason it's useless is because it has no slide. When I tried it out it was like trying to rub a rubber band down the length of the mirror and the mirror was wet at the time.On another note, my mirror arrived with some sort of glue spots on it. I had to remove the glue with ""Goof Off."" If I did not have ""Goof Off,"" my mirror would have been impossible to use because of the streaky glue.  However, I believe this was accidentally spilled or left on the mirror by the manufacturer so I suspect most people who order this mirror would not have this issue.Since I find it so hard to locate a truly fogless mirror, I give this mirror 4 stars even though the current price of $41.98 for the white mirror ($45.98 for the silver mirror) is a bit steep.  It would have gotten 5 stars had the squeegee and accessory holder been useful and the price been a bit cheaper.PostScript - My mirror is white not sliver like the one pictured on Amazon's product review page. Also, there is one more thing to love about this product; it comes in packaging that is incredibly easy to open. All I had to do was slide out the cardboard and the package was off--scissors and other cutting tools were not needed.UPDATE November 4, 2013: My boyfriend tried this mirror and he absolutely loves that it stays fog-free.  However, he feels that the light is useless because it is blinding and for him to get a good shave he has to have the mirror at a certain height.  That height conflicts with the use of the bright light.  If he put the mirror lower, the light would be fine at chest level but not at shaving level.  Personally, I do think the light is too bright as well because I had to stand on my tip toes to avoid the piercing glare.",4
"This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.",4
This works great as a base coat for nail art but is too runny to work great as french tips. You have to be super careful while applying as french tips because this nail polish likes to go all over the place. Still great cream white to draw over and dries really fast in true Essie style!,4
"I like these because of the minimalist look. I would give it 5 stars if they were just a little bit more flexible. I have very thin hair, so I wish I bend them 3 times around my ponytail for a better hold. I would buy these again.",4
"If you have naturally long, thick lashes like i do, then this is a great alternative to regular mascara. This product is all natural, which is what i love about it! So if you're lazy & dont remove your eye make-up, you dont have to worry about it taking out your lashes. Because it's all natural, it has good things in it, that will condition your lashes. I put on more than one coat..build up, so that it gives a more dramatic look.",5
love anything pink sugar....this was a great price cheaper than Ulta and Sephora and shipping was super fast. This deodarant does not leave a residue at all and it does not leave a white finish. Very smootha nd powedery texture..amazing!,5
"I had never really used any kind of tool like this but have recently started getting into doing my nails and figured I should pay more attention to my cuticles and what not. These tools were a really affordable option for all 3 items so I went ahead and ordered them. They got here within 2 weeks, that was 3 weeks before the estimated delivery window! Using them was really easy and actually made quite a bit of difference in how my nails looked so I'm happy with that as well.",5
"I use Biore strips regularly so I was looking forward to trying this mask.  The application is fairly difficult.  The mask is very thick and hard to put on.  I got the mask all over the place which I was not happy about.  It took too long in my opinion to get the mask slathered all over my face.  My normal mask goes on smoothly which I prefer.  With that said, as difficult as it is to get the mask on, it is just as difficult to get it off.  The heat aspect of the mask only lasts a couple of minutes and I don't think the heat really did anything.  I am disappointed with this product because I love using the facial strips.  If you need a good mask then just search for one on Amazon.  I use one that starts with &#34;Queen&#34;. I am sorry I don't remember the exact name of the mask but if you search for it you will see it has great reviews.",2
"I use this conditioner (shampoo), and so does my daughter, and my granddaughter.  We all love it so much because it makes our hair soft and it really looks fuller.  All of the WEN Products are totally excellent.  Follow the easy instructions, and enjoy how your hair feels!!  It's great!!",5
"I purchased this product mainly due to positive reviews and also the price. I would have to say I'm not very impressed, the polishes are EXTREMELY thick in consistency (and that's per botltle). It was impossible to get even consistent strokes when using this polish (even after shaking it up a few times), not worth me adding polish thinner to it, and why should I or anyone else have to do that? I'm thinking that this product is old and expired perhaps? Also I didn't care for the base colors.",1
"Ok, I'm 40 (for a while longer at least). I'm fortunate that so far I'm not dealing with too many wrinkles - some laugh lines, a few slight wrinkles, but nothing alarming yet. I've been using the kit for a couple of months because I wanted to give it ample time to show me its guaranteed effect. I wanted to see if I could truly notice a difference in my skin.Did I? Well, somewhat. These products definitely have a good moisturizing effect. My skin is soft. However, I honestly don't see any difference around my eyes or mouth, which are the areas that time has most affected on my face so far. I like that there is an SPF in the products, and that's good no matter the outcome of the wrinkle reducing. The big drawback is that I have rather sensitive skin, so I did notice an increase in blemishes and oily skin while using the product (that is a LOT of moisturizer and creams to be applying to your face each day).So, in the end, I don't see a huge benefit to this kit. It's quite expensive for the small improvement that I experienced, and I have other moisturizers that are far less expensive, kinder to my sensitive skin, and without the lengthy list of chemicals listed on the products in this kit.",2
"I got this shampoo for my wife. After she used the bottle she claims for the price, it works very well. However she did not notice much of a difference compared to ""non color care"" shampoo. She said it does leave her hair soft and silky, but it did nothing for her color. But for the price, she couldn't complain.",4
don't think it works for me. I use it a few time and during and after my wash my scalp was itchy.,2
"The best part of this product is the true matte finish it gives.  I do not like all the extra shine that comes with so many of the other hair gels out there--this does its job without that.  It has a definite cologne smell that I did not mind, but each person would have their own opinion there.  I did find it to still give a bit of crunchy feel still (although they advertise that it does not), but overall it held thick hair well.",4
This is great for this times I can't get a manicure. It helps me keep my nails looking great and healthy. Would not use anything else.,5
"I initially bought this item because I loved the idea of a product that wasn't tested on animals and it was organic.  However, this was also my first tinted moisturizer I've ever had and overall I wasn't really pleased with it . . .The amount of coverage was decent at best.  The formula was greasy and immediately made my oily face look even more oily.  As you can imagine I already wasn't pleased.  Looking at the reviews before I bought it, I noticed that almost everyone seemed to comment on its Lavender scent.  Though I usually like the scent of lavender, the smell of this tinted moisturizer was really strong and it really didn't smell much like lavender to me.  Furthermore, the applicator for this product was on the poorer side.  It was difficult to get the right amount of product out because it was either too much or too little and sometimes the product would flow back into the tube before you could get it.I won't be purchasing this product again.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recently bought Neutrogena's Tinted Moisturizer and it's amazing! I totally recommend it : http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Healthy-Sheers-Light-Ounce/dp/B001TSLK60/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336176965&sr;=8-3",2
"If you're like me you've been bombarded with print and television ads of actress Emma Stone (Crazy Stupid Love) repping Revlon's newest product, the Colorburst Lip Butters. Released in 20 different colors with dessert-inspired names, the lip butters were presented as being ultra-hydrating and luscious as well as long-lasting. And, honestly, what girl wouldn't want to look like Emma Stone?I picked up four of these on sale at my local CVS for around $5 each with coupon and promotions. The packaging for these lipsticks is a rectangular plastic quilted-pattern tube. The frosty color of the tube reflects the color of the product inside, which is nice and there is a clear plastic window at the very top of the tube so you can look inside and get an idea of what the color actually looks like (good move, Revlon).Now onto the color!  Tutti Frutti is a very bright orange with just the tiniest hint of peach to it.  I think it's the kind of color that would frequently be passed over on the shelf because it's a bit intimidating.  But it's definitely worth a second look and I'm glad I bought it.  First off, these lip butters (for the most part) do apply very sheer.  So you won't be applying some sort of opaque crayola crayon color.  I'm quite pale with brown hair and a slightly yellow complexion.  This suits me quite nicely, but I do need to apply it with a light hand.  It enhances my natural lip color with a bit of peach, which I like.  I often find orange lip colors flattering, though.  Tutti Frutti has great staying power as well.  The only donwside to this color is that I could see how this wouldn't be for everyone.  Orange is tricky that way.  Before purchasing I would recommend swiping the tester across your hand to see how the color fits with your own skintone.  I will definitely be repurchasing this when it runs out.Revlon's lip butters contain mago butter, Shea butter and jojoba oil, so they do live up to their claim of being ultra moisturizing. Considering this I was surprised by how pigmented they are as well. And, unlike many other department store cheap-o lip products, these lip butters don't have an artificial fragrance or a rancid taste. They are comparable to higher end makeup brands.Right now these lip butters are getting a lot of hype so you'll often find the displays raided at your local drug store. Keep checking! These are going to be a permanent part of Revlon's product line!",4

"I stopped by to give my opinion about the Anti-Cellulite Cream in the Sponge. I ordered and have used the Grapefruit Zest Pink Pepper scent, so that is the one I will be discussing. Of course, the cream's formula is the same regardless of the scent so that part is just personal preference.Pros: This sponge smells really great! The grapefruit scent should be well-liked by most people, assuming you ordered the scent because you like the grapefruit aroma. It does also provide a relaxing aromatherapy effect, making it a nice sponge regardless of the cellulite cream built-in. The cream itself lathers well and is rich, so it's enjoyable to use. This also makes it effortless, since you use a sponge and body wash to shower with anyway most likely. The sponge feels nice and leaves skin silky-smooth.Cons: There wasn't anything I really didn't like about the product. One thing you have to watch out for is keeping the sponge clean. This has nothing to do with the product's design, but it is important. If you don't clean it well and store it nicely it can get dirty. Besides just caring for it, there's nothing else to mention in the negative.Verdict: My cellulite has disappeared after using the sponge daily during the shower. You have to massage it into your skin, which may take some effort, but it feels very nice and smells great. Overall, it's a high-quality cellulite solution.",5
"I am not savvy with hair tools but I have tried the ceramic rollers from this specific Remington Pearl line so I gave another one of their products a try. It's definitely really girly as it has a pearly pink ceramic wand. It's easy to use and the control buttons are clear. Look wise, I really like this product. Its simple and dainty/girly. As far as use, I think I still prefer a curling iron over a wand as this can be hard to hold while making sure you aren't burning your other hand that's holding onto your hair tip.",3
I was always looking for emory boards and would always find worn out torn emory boards around the house. I finally got smart and bought this pack of emory boards and I am so glad that I did. Now I have enough to last me a long time and I never have to search for them. They are the really nice sturdy boards that you find at the salon. Great buy.,5
"These brush set is just wonderful, love that is cruelty free first of all, and the brushes they are so well made, love how they feel against your skin! They work wonderfully",5
I go to water aerobics and the chlorine super drys your hair.  This product saves the breakage.  Love it worth it!,5
This is my new favorite powder. Excellent coverage and perfect shade. I just wish it came with a regular powder pad instead of the brush.,5
Our teenage daughter loved this product and said this is what she needed for the many nail brushes she owns.,4
"I love this product, but just can't afford to buy it since the bottle is small and product runs out fast.",5
Not for me. I like Hard Candy's primer much better. This didn't really sit well on my face-- it felt very tacky and like it never absorbed.,2
Someone recommended this.  Its good.  Odd application but works well to keep eye shadows on for long wear. Prevents creasing of shades,4
The ammount of make-up in this kit is mind blowing.There are so many looks to make.The colors are very pigmented.Every single time I use this is makes me excitied.It folds up very nicely.,5
"better for newbs than the experienced!!! it smells AMAZING, i like it when i was stating back so it served its purpose",5
"This stuff is incredible! Admittedly, I typically buy cheaper brands of shampoo/conditioner (such as Suave) for economical reasons, but even if that were not true, this would be my new mainstay. The shine is wonderful and the smell is pure heaven. It's got a spicy, exotic sent that is nothing short of therapeutic in the shower (make a body wash, please!!!).I absolutely love the way it makes my hair feel and look and it keeps it smelling great all day long.Rarely do I get excited about hair care products, but the new Moroccan Infusion line is amazing. LOVE it...it's my new brand.**this review is a duplicate of my review of the Suave Moroccan Infusion shampoo. Both the shampoo and the conditioner are fantastic.",5
"Since I don't have enough hair for curls or styling, I'm writing this review on behalf of my wife :)Just on first impression, the brush looks cheaply made, and she said she would prefer a rubber handle for better grip. The on/off switch is loose and very easily slips from on to off, and she observed that 3 times while she was styling, it accidentally turned off. A better switch would be a basic improvement. The swivel cord feature is great though, as you are constantly twisting the brush. As for the styling itself, she felt the brush worked fairly well, and performed as expected. It's a very simple product and does the job. She never used the glove, and didn't feel she needed it.",3
"These colors are a lot of fun, especially when you mix together colors you wouldn't use and get colors you would.  Extra fine, don't really like the chunky ones.  Love to wear the pinks and oranges over lipstick and it keeps the lipstick on your lips and not drinking rims.",4
"This product is messy - you wouldn't think so being in a stick form and all...  It also looks very fake. It has a very opaque, matte finish - kind of like shoe polish.  Since my gray hairs are at my front hairline, I need something more natural looking. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because of the overall poor quality.",1
i love this conditioner.  it really works.  patience is required though because you might have to use more than once to see a difference.,5
"Sometimes I am worry about some scars and cicatrix on my skin. Just recently I used &#34;Rosehip Seed Oil&#34; on clean skin once a day to help diminish the appearance of my scars. Actually, it is smell-less, absorbs quickly despite of its oily nature and it moisturizes my skin and makes my skin very soft. It didn't cause any redness or irritation. I am excited to see its positive long term results specially on the damaged parts of my skin :)",5
"I bought this to use with the oil cleansing method. I am still experimenting with my oil ratios. But I am already in love, my skin is becoming more clear than it has been since I was 10. Castor oils is the actual cleanse soap, in the oil cleansing method, it can be drying so you have to find out just how much you need for your own personal cleansing routine. I enjoy Now brand, I just wish they carried an organic version. I may buy another castor oil when I am out that is organic.",5
This made every single pore on my face look like moon craters. I have very large pores to begin with and this highlighted them worse than any product I've ever used. I was shocked at how bad my skin looked!,1
"I recently started to go natural and did the 'Big Chop' a few months ago. Since then, I've been trying out many different products to see which ones work best for my color treated, curly hair texture. I've been using the As I Am Twist Cream and decided to look at other products within that brand. For a while, I've seen and heard of people doing co-washes with conditioner versus using shampoo. But, I always figured that conditioner alone could not do the job of a shampoo. I understand that there are some shampoos out there that strips the hair of moisture/oils, etc. For that reason, I have at least tried to purchase shampoos that are sulfate-free, such as Carol's Daughter.I read the product info and reviews for this co-wash, then decided to give it a try. First thing I noticed was how smooth it felt on my hair. I could also feel that it was actually cleaning the buildup from my hair and scalp. The best part of this cowash is it doesn't tangle. Combing out my hair with this product is amazing! It makes the process so much easier than other products I've tried.I'm still not totally sold on co-washing and may use shampoo occasionally. But, this Coconut CoWash will be a staple for my natural hair care products.",5
"It only takes one hand, and it's much easier than trying to hold a round brush and a dryer.  Don't try to dry your hair with it, because the heat is pretty low. I'm sure it would dry it eventually, but I don't recommend this styler for that! Anyway, I love it!",5
"*Looks like a toy or something you buy from a dollar store. I thought at first i got the wrong package but nope.*It has a very strong chemical smell when i first opened it. Too strong i feared for my skin. LOL*I am not sure what it's made of. Written ingredients scared the s&%t out of me..still don't know what those are. (theres google i know but don't have time to research)2 stars since i know i got what i paid for.Tried to contact seller to see what they gonna say about the strong chemical odor and maybe return it which is silly of me given i don't like to hassle myself returning items since we are base out overseas, but amazon sent me auto reply saying that the recipients have decided to leave the Amazon's platform or are not eligible to receive any further email communications. In short, this item is somewhere far from my vanity desk. Anyway, since i am whining here, i went ahead and ordered the real thing. Lessons learned: BUY THE REAL THING. AVOID ANYTHING REPLICA OR KNOCK OFF ESP IF YOU USE IT IN YOUR SKIN! SAVE YOUR $$. SAVE YOUR SKIN.",2
"I picked up a packet of this product at Sally Beauty Supply locally, on a whim.  My hair is 40-something, color treated and about 40% gray.  I'm caucasian, with thick, coarse, wavy hair while growing up, but with hormonal fluctuations (possible thyroid issue) my hair's texture has become even coarser and often fuzzy.  Very tough to keep it under control and looking healthy.This product was left on my hair for 15 minutes (5 minutes longer than recommended...) and rinsed out, following a shampooing with my usual moisturizing product.  After styling it was softer and shinier, with less frizz throughout the day and into the next day.  Unfortunately the next day without it, brought back the same issues.While not promoted as a daily treatment, I think if used daily it might just be a saving grace for my hair.  The product has a pleasant scent and rinses cleanly.  I didn't get an oily build-up on my hair with one use, which is sometimes an issue for me using other Argan oil products.I will be picking up more of this product and using it daily to see if it helps to balance things out for me.  I recommend it to anyone with unruly, course textured hair who wants to restore softness and shine to their hair.",4
"Hands down anything by proactiv is the best. To me atleast. I can actually feel the magic in this toner working in my pores everyday. Because of this toner and a couple mary kay products, my skin has really cleared up and improving daily.",5
"This is a great product.. its so convenient to have sunscreen, thats also mineral coverage.  I really like this its so light you can barely feel it.  I love Peter Thomas Roth products.  I highly recommend this",5
"The only way to go to apply makeup, evenly applies your foundation and concealer,(cream or stick). Nothing like the cheap wedges or foundation brushes that just move the liquid or cream foundation around. You save from wasting your product that costs so much today.",5
Any beauty fanatic would be in heaven with this kit! Look at all your selection to choose from and it is so small and compact in this carrying case! A built in mirror is a plus as well. Wow! Great price and product-great for days of fun!,5
"This 2 in 1 Shampoo & Conditioner is pretty good.  It cleans well and leaves the hair and scalp feeling good.  Unfortunately it doesn't provide the best detangling for those with thicker, longer hair.  You may feel as though you still need an additional conditioner after using this.  For most boys or girls with shorter, finer hair, I'm sure it's enough.It's a bit on the thin side though.  Pretty runny in my opinion which may make it a bit more difficult for younger kids that wash their own hair.  They may spill a bit more than they should or it may tend to drip down their face easier than a thicker formula might.The Peach scent is nice, it's not real strong but it's not too light either.  It doesn't go beyond the shower though.  As soon as you rinse it, the smell no longer lingers in your hair.I would give his product about 3 1/2 stars.  It should be good for most kids but if you have a child with thick, long hair, it may not be your best option.",4
"I've been happy with all of my other opi polish.  I splurged on this at Ulta, and it is the worst nail product I've tried.  Not only does it smell atroucious-I think it's loaded with formeldahyde-It actually makes my polish chip off faster than if I haden't used a top coat at all.  Total junk.  I think I'll return it to the store today.",1
"I was using st. Moriz tanning mousse before I tried this product. At first I thought this was better but I don't think so anymore. First, this gives you a more subtle color but I tend to like a more dramatic bronze. Sometimes after applying it at night and washing off in the morning I feel as though I've washed off all the color! Second, it does not last long, it may give you a nice glow but after 2-3 showers its pretty much completely gone. Third, I have to put on so much because the spray does not spread easily. I do like the mitt it comes with. I just use it with my other fake tan. So I say if you want a nice glow for a special occasion, go for it. If you're looking for all year round bronze, you may wanna try elsewhere.",3
"Anyone who wears fake lashes should know that Red Cherry are the best lashes money can buy... However, they have sooooooooo many styles. These #117 are very thick and give you a nice dramatic look. I love them. But my faves for every day are the #48's. Check them out as well. I bought about a dozen different styles to try and although I like them all, I tend to go back to the #48's the most. They are beautifully curled, the perfect thickness and look totally natural. They give the perfect look for day or night! But these 117's are beautiful as well. Try a bunch! :)",5
The soap fits the product description. I have no complaints with it. It works exactly as I expected it to.,5
"Exfoliates, makes skin smooth and it glows afterwards. I have been using it all over my body not just the face.Glad that it also contains an extra head in the refill pad. I am definitely going to keep ordering.",5
"It's very soft, and a nice size and seems to be quite durable so far. I do like it a lot for my very sensitive, thin skin. If you are wanting something that will exfoliate however, this is not the sponge for that purpose. It is very gentle on the skin.",5
"This is a good product, I just didn't use it regularly but it seems to have worked anyway. I'm sure for someone who actually follows directions this will be an amazing product and will work as it claims.",5
"UPDATED 3/18/2014 What I have figured out is that my unit has to be unplugged between uses, not just turned off. When I unplug it, it works every single time. Great straightener!This may be my favorite straightener ever, BUT I have trouble getting mine to stay on long enough to heat up. This was my second one actually and I had the same problem with the first. Decided to keep this one because I do love the way it works when it stays on.In the summer I only use this on my bangs because it would be a waste of time to do my whole head on a humid day. When it heats up, it heats up FAST and I can get my bangs done in a minute.Update 10/19/12 Remington was nice enough to replace my defective one with another one that will not stay on unless I push the button five times. This is my third unit and I will not spend another seven bucks to mail this one back.ETA: I have found that if I pick it up and turn it on, it tends to turn on on the first try more often.",4
"I have two other foundations that I mainly use but this comes a close second to them.  Great coverage.  Stays put.  Easy to use.  What more could you ask for?  Maybe make it easier to find.  I've been so surprised at how many stores have dropped this product. I really love Max Factor and hope it doesn't get discontinued.  That would be a real shame for such a good brand.  Their mascara, 2000 Calories, is one of the best I've used too.  Went looking for it the other day in the store but no luck.  Thank goodness we can still get it here. :)",5
"I love this primer and had to go to the hospital and had it on and it lasted for two days till my husband brought my makeup remover to me, I was very pleased and service was good from this company.",5
This stuff sucks put it on 9pm last night first nail fell off at 5pm today... and I was driving all day!!! This stuff is not good... keep searching...,1
Perfect quality in my opinion! They are all shipped and nicely protected and they don't smear! Love it!! I recommend this for eyeliner lovers like myself !,5
"i use to rock just this on my nails, its a little milky look but it really made them feel healthy and strong, i loved having this one, i felt my nails stayed better looking longer",5
"I use these as &#34;accent&#34; nails. I paint my nails one color and then leave one of my fingers bare and add these strips to them for something fun and unexpected.They last about 4-5 days if you are using your hands a lot. I type everyday, use my smart phone, wash my hands a ton, etc. So mine usually last about 4 days and I remove them on the 5th day when they start to really chip. You can chip away at it and peel it off after a few days, but it's best to soak in acetone.",4
"If you are looking for a luxurious, silky great smelling body wash move on.  You will not find it with this.  If you are looking for an economical and basic clean smelling body wash then this is for you.I am one of those people who have at least 3 different body washes in the shower at any given time.  Overall, my skin has different needs at different times and different parts of my skin have different needs most of the time (sorry, the last part of that sentence might have been TMI).  What I mean is sometimes I want a really nice fruity or exotic body wash to feel pampered.  Sometimes I want a nice exfoliating body wash.  What I get with Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture is a nice, creamy, medium weight body wash.While there is some lather to it I wouldn't say it is sudsy.  I normally squeeze my body wash onto a synthetic scrubby I keep in the shower but that didn't seem to be the best application for this product.  I found that applying it out of the stream of the shower directly to my skin was the best approach.  Just like you are applying lotion.  I let it all soak in for a bit and then I washed it off with the scrubby.There didn't seem to be any type of obvious coating on my skin after rinsing.  My skin felt nice and smooth so I skipped the usual after shower lotion and/or oil application.  The next morning I did feel a bit dry and did end up moisturizing after showering with the Dove.Overall I think it is a good product that does the job.  Good value for the money.",4
it's a good foundation primer that prep my skin for makeup. it doesn't change the color of your skin but make it smoother.,5
again just like the bigger flat iron it is a wonderful product and get very hot. know this flat iron is smaller and easier to handle so I let my 11 yo granddaughter use it she loves it.,5
"I love the colour yellow and was trying to find a nice shade that wasn't too bright and appropriate to wear for work. Lemon Fizz fit the bill. It's a lighter shade, but still noticeable as yellow.  It looked great under a yellow&red glitter polish I added on top as well. I will definitely be using this colour a lot during the summer.",5
"I use many of the Olay Regenerist products, and they are among my favorite... but this particular one is a bit underwhelming.  I have tried the Garnier eye roller product, and had just as good results, as far as treating morning bags under the eye.  I actually prefer the Regenerist Eye DermaPods over either brand of the eye rollers.  Yes, the roller is a quick and simple method to apply the product, which may be worth while to ladies who have to get down and dirty with their beauty routine.  Myself, I will stick with those cute little pods that work so well for me...",4
"I purchased this product and it arrived empty. The bottle appeared to have leaked out at some point. I wrote to the company and they tried to say that they did not ship it empty - which still doesn't change the fact that it arrived empty. I sent it back to the company and haven't heard back from them. It's been way over a month since I shipped it back at my own expense. I am out of the original money, I am out of the actual product and I had to pay to ship it back to them!",1
i like this curling iron so much it is bigger than i imagined so i liked that um i cant really complain it gets the job done too,5
I love this sun-in.  It is a cheap alternative for teens to gradually lighten their hair without breaking the bank.,5
Have always loved this product & happy a better price online as I use it all the time. Packaged well.,5
This was the 1st Gel-Polish I bought. This is a fabulous fall/winter color! Its the perfect shade of a dark red. Its exactly the color that is shown in the display picture too - which is always hard to know how true it is. Love it and would highly recommend~,5
I bought this product for shading and contouring.  It works great for this purpose - the color is sort of on the taupe side - so it is perfect for shading.,5
"These bows are so cute on your nails. The are a little big, so they really should be used on long nails but either way they are cute!",5
This lasts forever and I would highly recommend it.  My skin feels so clean and fresh after using and it dries quickly.,4
It works great! My face looks fresher after I use it. The skin looks like the stale layer of skin has been removed.,5
"I've been buying a lot of headbands lately, just looking for one to stay in place when I work out and to keep my hair out of my face. Haven't found any to do just that until I got this one, and this is definitely one of the ones I spent the least amount of $$ on. I really like it and a will probably buy another one.",5
"I was fortunate enough to receive these QTips through Amazon Vine, but I'll definitely buy them in the future.It's hard to get *too* worked up about these new Qtips - after all, these are simply regular QTips with the addition of a tapered ""precision"" tip. However, I do find them much more useful than regular QTips for makeup and nail polish application.  No matter how hard I try, I'm kind of sloppy with nail polish application. These precision tip QTips allow me to ""clean up"" around my nails without smudging the polish.Recommended.",5
"I discovered psssssst dry shampoo in a buzzfeed article. I had tried dry shampoos in the past and was never pleased. After seeing that this is the original dry shampoo, I thought I would give it a try. SO GLAD I DID! I have thin hair and this dry shampoo gives a lift without overwhelming my fair hair.",5
Best color I own! Great formula and pigmentation. I posted a pic so everyone can see how true to color it is.,5
"I've used this for almost 4 years, and I'm very glad to get it here much lower with my set and subsribe on amazon.I use it a few times a week and the longer it stays on skin, it gets darker. It has never irritated my skin at all. Now they changed the formula , it doesn't smell as strong, but i think it takes longer to color. still the smell would disappear in an hour before, it really softens my skin and adds a light tan!",5
"This nail file is just so, so. Would not buy again.  Wish it had been a little wider and longer.",3
"I have tried many shampoos, trying to find the perfect one for my long thin fine colored hair, and this is the closest to perfect I have found.  Even while shampooing, my hair felt moisturized.  The fragrance was pleasant and I didn't have to use too much to get a good lather.  Combined with Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, this left my hair very very soft and with a fullness that I rarely see with other shampoos.  The only negative I found was that the lid broke off at the hinge the first time I opened the shampoo, so perhaps a stronger lid/hinge is needed.  I will gladly overlook that minor issue, though, for the great results I got with this shampoo.",5
"Basically what this thing does is remove the very top of the blackhead. When your pores are really clogged, they get so compacted that the blackheads dome up slightly over your pore. This is the part that gets black, hence &#34;blackhead&#34;. This little tool scrubs that away. Does it remove the entire blackhead? Nothing short of an extraction will do that. But if you want to get acne medicine deeper into your pore (or even a mask) you can scrub them over with this first, and then apply. It does seem to help the medicine penetrate deeper. So that's really nice. BUT it is not a &#34;blackhead remover&#34; like advertised.",3
"I love these hair clips soo much, I bought two of these and use them all of the time.  Love it!",5
I love this product I like the smell its nice and clean. Its not too greasy goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. Have only used less than a week so not sure how good it works.,5
"This hair color i think is ok.I think it has way too much blue though and should have more black.Everyone was telling me you have blue hair!!! And another negative was that it faded the second day, a week later my dark brown hair was back and my bangs were still blue. Not a good black hair dye. Try ultimate black instead does not fade!!!",2
"Lovely light lotion, pleasant to apply at night. Leaves skin soft and smooth, and the wrinkles just as they were before.I find this a good product to use regularly. It is competitively priced and high quality.",4
Amazing for hair I love it makes my hair look and feel amazing and helps manage my hair and keep it tame,5
"I have used this product for about 10 years and I will never use anything else.  If you like to have natural looking lashes that are feathery and look like your own, only longer, then this is your dream product.  I'm a California woman and the tips of my own lashes have lightened from enjoying the sunshine.  This product darkens them plus adds to my own length and slightly thickens them as well.  I use it for both daytime and nighttime and it washes off with simple water, yet never runs or puts streaks under your eyes.  Other products would look good, but leave dark circles under my eyes whenever I rubbed them.  I tried waterproof types but bits would fall off into my eyes and irritate them, and worse, end up taking my own eyelashes off when I would remove it later with eye makeup removers. I have used both the Black and Dark Brown colors, but for daytime, I prefer the Dark Brown as it looks softer, but still looks close to black to me.  If I am looking for a more dramatic look, I switch to the Black.  My eyes are Hazel/brown/green, and my hair color has been everything from honey blond to medium dark brown to auburn. If you have lighter skin and hair, I highly recommend the Dark Brown Color over the black.  A really great product!",5
"These brushes get the job done just fine!  No they are not the most superior in quality but they are priced very reasonably, and for the money, the product is great!!!!  I love these as a backup to my main set!",4
after reading all the reviews i easily felt comfortable purchasing this light. i have since bought it for a friend. it works perfectly and you can fit two hands in it at once! awesome deal for the price. i'm sure you can find a cheaper light but you wont find a better one.,5
"This is a quality polish that goes on smooth and cures to a hard shine that lasts without chipping. The color isn't as deep as I thought it was going to be - I was expecting a deep sparkling pewter, instead it's a sparkling chrome - still very pretty though",4
"This is a nice-looking snorkel max which uses silicone materials and an easily adjustable design.  Having a smaller mask for family members with smaller heads makes sense. It's obviously a lot more fun when the mask fits snugly, but not too snug. I got this one for fun, primarily for use in lakes, but it will probably also get some use in swimming pools. I love the aqua blue color. US Divers has made a good product. I'm pleased with it.",5
~A great deal and super fast shipping. It's amazing how fast it heats up. And it gets very hot on high.,5
"So far, I can tell a small difference in my skin since trying this cream. I can tell my skin is smoother, but I will have to keep using it to see if it is going to really help with the cellulite. I know that there is no way to really get rid of cellulite, and products like this are only meant to mask it so I know what to expect. The directions say to rub it in vigorously, and you really do or else it will leave you a little greasy. I still have to wash my hands after applying it because I can't seem to get it off any other way.",4
"This lotion smells so yummy!!! It helps give you an awesome tan. It doesn't have a high amount of bronzer in it, so you won't have any streaks after using. I bought this lotion at the salon before, and this is the exact same for much cheaper of course.",5
It's just regular mascara. Nothing special. The turning knob just adjusts the amount of mascara that goes on the applicator. It tightens and loosens the opening is all.,2
"The colour is beautiful and looks great on my nails. The nail polish goes on smooth and doesn't bubbles. The texture is just right, you only need 2 coats to get the job done. It lasted a whole week without chipping. The best thing about this polish is, it is very affortable and will have your nails looking gorgeous. This nail polish is better than O.P.I.. So if you are looking for a good nail polish get this brand, you will not regret it.",5
they do exactly what they are supposed to would absolutely recommend  them.  i also got the straight ones they are good too,4
"I absolutely love these mini nail polishes. The colors are beautiful. I actually kept the pinks and gave the others as a gift (they come in an individual box of 5), the person receiving these loved them also. I've painted my nails a couple of times and still have more to use. It help me decide to get the bigger bottle for the colors I absolutely loved. The glitter is perfect, I wish I could post pictures as I have the nail polish on with the glitter and it looks really pretty. You can't go wrong with these mini bottles. They arrived quickly too.",5
"This is a good blow dryer, but I guess I was really expecting to be BLOWN away (pardon the pun), but I was not. Generally, it does no better job of drying than Wal-Mart cheapies I have purchased in years past. It is heavy as lead, so you might build biceps trying to dry your hair. The temperature and air controls are good. Generally, I don't feel bitten by this purchase--nor would I go out of my way to buy another one.",3
"Didn't buy this from Amazon, as I got a great deal on Ebay. This plate came with the black nail polish, the stamper, and the scrapper.I am an amazon junkie, but when I saw a good deal + free shipping on ebay, I couldn't pass it up. But I am writing this review, just in case someone has questions on whether the plate is good or not.Let me tell you now, this is a great plate. I was mad at first, cos images won't transfer well and so many errors which turned out to be my fault.When swipping on the plate, swipe away from you, preferably to the right. Every design came out great. I uploaded a picture with a different design on each nail. The picture is the red and black one. Red base with wet and wild fast dry, and the black is konad black.",5
"This is the only product I use for my hair.  It usually is very expensive, but the price was right....",5
"This stuff really helps tame my thick, unruly curls into a super smooth blown-out look while still keeping a little wave in my hair. Too much though will just look oily....only use a little.",5
Made my hair white and was basically like spray in baby powder. Pay a lil more for a nicer brand (I now use Batiste around $6 at walmart) and it won't turn your hair white or make your scalp gunk up with stuff.,3
I bought this to keep my boyfriend's toiletries organized at my place and it's perfect. It has a large center opening and several pouches all around. It fits everything a person needs for the bathroom and is portable.,5
"This polish is definitely a glitter as opposed to a full coverage polish.  It is not as coarse to the touch as most glitters (fine sandpaper feel) but was just fine after a top coat.  Lot of blue and silver in the color, not as gray as pictured.",3
"I generally don't like 2-in-1 products (I prefer separate shampoo and conditioner), but this is a very nice product. It has a pleasant smell and seems to work well for what it's supposed to do. Recommended.",4
"My 4 year old daughter LOVES this (and, I'm not gonna lie - I've actually thought about trying this on myself; so far I've resisted). It's really simple to use (for an adult, although I bet a 7 or 8 year old girl can probably handle it as well). The gems do a great job of staying in and so far I haven't hit any major snags getting them out of my daughter's hair. Her hair isn't super thick so that might have something to do with it. If you're going to buy this product, I'd suggest picking upConair HJ3RP Replacement Pack, 0.033 Pound; I'm constantly losing the gems so it's nice to know it's easy to pick up more when they're all gone.",5
"I bought this refill thinking that I'd save a few bucks.  However, after refilling 2 soap bottles, I realized that it would've been pretty much the same price as buying 2 new regular hand soaps with pumps.",3
"I can't get past the chemical, artificial cocoa scent. Real cocoa butter smells much more pleasant and also works much better. I think this particular product is too greasy, and I don't like that the second ingredient is mineral oil, a clogging ingredient.",1
"Best shampoo/conditioner ever! Smells wonder, little needed to wash & condition, easy on hair and just wonderful over all. One more word",5
"I have a really hard time finding blush that works well for me, because my complexion is not quite yellow toned, and not quite blue toned.  I seem to fall in the middle --- like blu-yell!  And, this is the issue many other women face.  We don't fit into the designated slots --- with many cosmetics.I think this blush will work with many skin tones.  It appears very natural with me, but does not have the heavy load some have reported.  I have to layer to get the desired effect, but I'm a little tan right now, so that may be a factor.  I have noticed that once applied, it appears to stick, unlike some blushers that seem to disappear after a few hours.All said, I'd say, if you've had a problem finding the right blusher, this one may work for you.  It's affordable, so give it a try.  I know that since its arrived here, it's been my,  go-to-blush, which says  a lot.",5
Nice price. Bought it for my son for our up coming beach trip. Has all of the bath supplies he will need plus he loves axe products.,5
"Lotion is something that we use quite a bit in our house however, with all of us having sensitive skin, slathering on the stuff can be unpleasant. Though Adovia Mineral Lift Serum is not a &#34;lotion&#34; it is still an effective moisturizer. You can tell immediately that Adovia's Mineral Serum will be gentle just by smelling it. When my little guy came down with a cold, his nose got the typical chap that little one's noses get from the nose running. Not having anything else that was gentle enough, I decided to try Adovia's serum around his nose to help alleviate the discomfort from the chap. Much to my surprise when he awoke the next morning, his nose was no longer inflamed and red and he wasn't complaining about the chap. To add to it, putting the serum on and around my little guy's chapped nose did not cause any discomfort (which most any other lotion/moisturizer has caused when applied to chapped skin).When the summer heat comes (or the pre-summer heat) my face becomes sensitive and also tends to break out more than other times of the year; with the air being very humid, it's unnecessary for me to use a heavy moisturizer. I like Adovia's serum, because it's gentle as mentioned above, but it doesn't cause me breakouts and provides just enough moisture without feeling heavy/greasy, I feel like my skin can still breath. I don't look forward to any chapped areas on my face (which I know I will be getting sooner or later), but I do look forward to seeing how the Adovia Serum affects the healing of those areas.Though, I don't have scientific proof in my hands, I am sure the faster healing process of my little guy's chapped nose occurred due to the Dead Sea minerals in the serum; with modern diets and the state of the environment it's very hard for our bodies to get the vitamins and minerals that they need. Adovia's Mineral Lift Serum is an easy step to experiencing the benefits of Dead Sea minerals.Disclosure: I received this product for free to try and review.",5
"I really like this product, it covers well. Maybe too well, it took a few scrubs to get it off.",4
"This brush is definitely of better quality than the MAC brushes I own. Shed a bit bit less than the MAC ones I own and far more expensive. The problem is the ferrel fell off the handle. A makeup stylist recommended similar brushes for less on instagram, said you can purchase them here with better quality and less money. I love my Bellus F86 brush. I bought all the Bellus brushes to replace my MAC and this Sigma after this shedding experience and love them.",3
"Kiddo does not love it, but she also doesn't want to give up her current Abby Cadabby toothpaste (she's over Sesame, but not Abby yet), so I think some of her &#34;ewww, grosss!&#34; complaints are just grousing. I think it tastes fine and I like what they have in this. I thought it was a good transitional paste to what we'll eventually use in the next year. She's just under two now. I'll update the review when we fully switch.",3
"OPI gel color has beautiful colors, more to my liking than other gel brands.  I bought the items needed for a gel manicure in spite of negative things I read on relevant websites.  I followed all the instructions carefully and watched countless videos.  I tried repeatedly.The stuff just won't stick.  It doesn't chip, it just lifts off in a single sheet after a few days.  And it shrinks when cured and you simply cannot get it to cling to the free edge.  All as it was said to be on those websites.  Try Gelish instead.  Much better.",1
My step mom has one of these an i remember always using it when i would visit my dad. her is professional and this one works just as well. i absolutely love it. It takes about 3 hours to fully melt the wax to use. the wax is pretty hot when you dip your hand in. i turned it to the lowest setting to let the wax cool down and after a while it actually hardened up to hard to use. i use the cool setting when i keep the machine on for a couple days so that way when i want to use it i just turn it to hot. this was the best bday gift ive ever gotten myself and i highly recommend it!,5
Wonderful shampoo.  Left my hair very soft and made the colors glow.  I have highlights and low lights and was surprised after using this shampoo how the colors were richer in appearance.  I will buy this again.,5
This brush may probably be one of the best brush among EcoTools brushes. Pretty soft and the quality is not bad at all :)),4
"I really like the feel of this lotion,it is a medium level tingle for me. Do not let the name scare you.This lotion rubs in well, and does not have a heavy ATO.(actually I noticed zero)This should be in everyone's lotion rotation.It does give a nice color boost.",4
"I have fair to medium skin.This product did very little.Furthermore, it gave me mild breakouts. Not a fan.The results were mildIf you want a slight glow, then this product may be for you.However, do not expect anything drastic.",3
"This is a great hood for you to set your curlers or do an at home conditioning treatment. The chin strap allows you to use your blow dryer hands free, so you can put on your make up while conditioning or setting your rollers. Depending on your blow dryer cord you might need to be sitting. I set mine up strap it to my head and lay my blow dryer on a hand towel on its side and then turn it on. by the time I am finished, with my makeup or brushing my teeth, my hair is ready! The only draw back and it lost a star for this is the adjustment pulls and toggle are on the side of mine. They get in the way. Over all this is a great product and I will buy it again when this one falls apart.",4
"I saved this product until I could give it a true test, so this review is a result of a test run during a very sunny long weekend at the shore.PROS: I really liked the non-greasy formulation of this product. I tend to break out from traditional lotions, so I appreciated another option. Initially, I also liked that it went on clear. The marketing literature for Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30 states that it ""instantly cools and refreshes skin."" It lives up to the cooling side of that promise in spades, so much so that I got goosebumps while applying it in the morning in my chilly air conditioned hotel room. The can is sizable and will last many applications.CONS: Unfortunately, one of the aspects of this that I liked eventually turned out to be its downfall. Because this sunscreen goes on invisible and dries almost instantaneously, it's almost impossible to tell what parts of the skin it's covered and what ones it hasn't. As a result, I experienced a few burn spots. As other reviewers have pointed out, despite the manufacturer claiming this product is rub-free, the instructions state to rub in, and I believe you need to do so to get proper coverage. Just make sure you do so quickly because the mist is gone within seconds.",3
"Every woman that comments on this loves it. It created a frenzy at work when I sprayed it on a male coworker while in the office. Six or seven women rose from their cubicles to discover the provenance of the holy smell. They surrounded him and started cooing, ""oooh ahhhing"" and complimenting him. The cocky bastard simply said, ""it really works well with my skin."" :)I bought this after Millesime Imperial and was surprised that Aventus gets me even more compliments. Ladies tell me I smell sexy and manly (ages 19 - 46) and even my father (who's one of those tough old school Clint Eastwood types) says it's the best one he's smelled. My mom and sister (age: 24) also love it. My sister said she walked into my mom's living room and thought I was in there because the smell was there. In reality, I simply walked past the living room straight to my brother's bedroom. I had sprayed the cologne on 10 minutes before I visited my mom's place. Wow. My sister then said ""that is the best one you have"" I said ""No, sh... it cost me three hundred dollars"" LOLThis lasts around 10-12 hours on my skin, and I haven't even tried for longevity on clothes. It projects a good four to six feet even after 8 hours.This gets me more compliments than L'eau D'Issey, which was my reigning champ until I bought Creed's Millesime Imperial.I'm too nervous to buy discounted Creeds, so I bought this as well as Millesime Imperial from the creedboutique online.Tobacco Vanille Tip: I love Tobacco Vanille but my female friend (age: 25) who worked at L'Occitane said it smells JUST LIKE Eau de Baux. Nevertheless she loved the Tobacco Vanille on me. Also, the hottest girl at work (age 27 Pakistani) loved it too (she's like a 9.5 out of 10 Salma Hayek type, no exaggeration). Check them both out before you buy Tobacco Vanille. I LOVE TOBACCO VANILLE but have never smelled the MUCH cheaper L'Occitane.",5
It came in a variety of colors as advertised and filled to the brim. The size is perfect for nail art and the variety keeps things interesting. Awesome purchase for economy of scales.,5
I had bought this dark gray color for my daughter away to college but when I saw it on her manicure I fell in love with it. I normally buy pinks and corals but this gray is unique and provides great coverage. I can use either for water marble or for accents in decorating. You must get it if you like to have unique colors and receive many compliments.,5
I have struggled with KP all my life and this is the first product that I have found that works!,5

"I was recommended this product from a friend to control my frizz. I use it to co wash my hair every 2-3 days and Ouidad shampoo once a week which using Too Shea conditioner in between. It does a great job of getting build up gunk from my hair making it light again while not activating my frizz issue. It also has a nice minty smell to it. Once my regimen in the shower is complete, I rinse my hair out, leaving it nice and soft again. Must better than any of my old products. Give it a try if you have curls or bad frizz =]",4
"The shade I selected turned out darker than it looks in the picture. It looks really good on me though, so I guess it's alright. My lips feel really hydrated and soft, and not just sticky like other 'moisturizing' lip glosses I've tried. Even though it's a bit over my price range for a lip gloss, I'm still willing to buy another one because of the quality of the product.",4

When combined with my daily Pedegg regimen, my calluses have nearly disappeared in a week, and I have noticed that the cuticles on my fingers are in better shape too.The only drawback for me was the smell - I didn't really care for it and it is pretty stong, clashing with my perfume. I'd prefer an unscented version of the cream but I'm willing to forgo the smell for the other benefits, namely heels that are no longer cracked.",4

"When I saw the word ""holographic"" I assumed it was one of the new holographic polishes that change color as you change your view of the nails. This product is not that type of holographic, the seller might consider rewording the description because others might assume this as well. The polish is very light, and even several coats didn't really show any color. It has a pretty glitter in it, and would be great (as other reviewers have noted) as a top coat on a darker polish. The polish's sparkle is pretty, a burgundy/purple color. The polish has lasted more than a week on my nails. Granted without an all over color, I can not judge whether it would have chipped by now. It is basically a clear polish with colored glitter.",3
I didn't really like it... :/ It didn't meet my expectations. It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair. Ended up giving it away.,2
"I think I have tried every lip stain type product there is. Sephora's isles have nothing I haven't sampled, not does the drugstore or department stores. Most tear up my lips, others don't actually last that long. And then there is the dreaded ""fuchsia curse"" that most pretty colors seem to suffer as soon as I put them on my lips. (Benetint, etc) This goes on without turning bright pink, lasts for hours and does not dry out my lips. As a redhead I'd love to see a more orange/brown over the berry/brown, but this color looks good. And that's coming from somebody who NEVER buys anything with ""berry"" in the name. Thankfully they put good pictures up, and I decided to go for it.Seller was fast and nice, even included a gift with purchase!",5

It has definitely toned the skin and made my complexion appear brighter.  Very fine lines seem diminished, but there isn't a product out there that will get out the wrinkles.I like this product so well, I plan to purchase a replacement bottle (along with the other products in the line) in the next few weeks.  I highly recommend this to us 'older' folk.",5
"I have used this product since I was a teenager (in my mid-twenties now) and I have to say this product has always delivered. I don't know why I stopped using it. But I can say that the reviews others say of offering shiny, more manageable hair are correct. I will be repurchasing soon!",5
"I am someone who loves to try new products in hopes that they might actually provide the results they so very much promise, however, before handing over my hard earned cash, I do research and read the reviews on the product that I choose to buy. I came across rapidlash, and as someone who has hates to wear mascara, I'd figured I would love to try a product that ""promises"" to grow more, fuller, darker lashes. I looked up the reviews & comments on rapidlash, and even though I was skeptic of the product, (as I am of most products that promise to enhance, or make you beautiful in some way) I purchased it. I figured that for $30 if it worked, it would be well worth the money, and if it didn't, then at least I tried it for myself and got my answer, AND I wouldn't be out a buck load of money.Well, I tried it, and it worked. Yes I was surprised too. Normally the beauty products that I buy, rarely, rarely ever work, but after a month of using this product on a nightly basis, my lashes are longer, and there's more of them. I am on month number two of usage, and I have noticed that they have begun to get darker as well. I have nothing negative to say about this product (again another surprise) it worked as promised for me, no side effects, no eye burning, no skin discoloration, nothing. Just results. I recently purchased a second tube, and am very satisfied with my results.",5
"I was provided a free bottle of this product in exchange for an honest and fair review. I really wanted to LOVE this argan oil blend. My hair has dreadfully dry ends from a botched dye job that are growing out, so I was hoping for some mega-moisture and split end repair (or at least temporary split end relief). I also was excited by the blend of proven oils and moisturizers in this mix--argan, coconut, jojoba and olive oils, for example, all have great reputations, so a blend of these and other oils sounded magnificent in theory. Unfortunately, my actual experience was just okay, not the life changing experience (or at least hair changing experience) I had wished for.I first tried the oil blend as a leave-in conditioner and slept with it in my hair overnight. Big mistake. I woke up with crunchy hair. From this I learned that the product is not good as a leave-in conditioner for someone like me who has thin, wispy hair. The product is labeled for all hair types, but based on my experience, I think it is probably not advisable for people with ultra-fine, ultra-thin hair like mine. The manufacturer might consider changing the &#34;leave in conditioner&#34; instructions to account for differences in hair type.Next I tried the argan oil blend as a 1-hour conditioner. Interestingly, my dry ends seemed to resist the product soaking in, which surprised me. My healthier, newer hair growth, in contrast, drank it up. This was the exact opposite of what I expected. I used shampoo and rinsed, then checked the results. My roots actually seemed a little greasy from the argan oil mix, and I didn't see any changes to my dry ends. I get the sense from comments made by others, however, that both times I used too much of the product. Maybe if I try a different approach using much less I might have better results.Interestingly, this oil mix rinses off of skin and hands very easily, unlike other oil based hair treatments that linger and are hard to remove from the hands after application on the hair. This was a positive result. Another positive was the slightly coconut scent of the product, which I enjoyed. Technically, the product is unscented, but the natural coconut essence is still somewhat detectable. I happen to like this a lot. It is definitely not overbearing.Bearing all of this in mind plus taking into account some comments I have heard from others, I might actually get a lot of use out of this argan oil blend as a moisturizer for the skin, and I'm going to try it. Seeing how fast this elixir was absorbed by my healthy hair and how easily it rinsed off my hands, I have a feeling it will make a nice summer substitute for heavier lotions. I suspect ithis blend will sink into the skin very nicely.So, in summary, for me this product was okay, but too heavy for daily use on hair as fine as mine. If you have thick hair, this argan oil blend might work perfectly for you. In my case, I'm going to try to use the argan oil mix on my skin to see if it performs better there, and I will also continue to try to experiment with and tweak the quantity I use on my hair, in case there is an optimal amount to use for thin haired folks like me.",3
"These are cute and ok, definitely false looking and huge, so I guess it depends on what look you are going for",3
"I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn't re-purchase.",4
"I was hoping to like these, but they hurt way too much.  They hold my hair,, but they are tight and pinch all day long and pull an rip out my hair when I take it out.  My hair is only 10 inches long so it's not a lot of hair being stuffed in, but it hurts when I use it to hold in the ends of a bun.  My hair is very fine, but very curly, so maybe it's for straight hair.  I ended up getting the hair pins from Franz Luxe or something like that and they don't pinch my hair, so I'm happy with them.",2
I love this palette. I got it in the mail just fine and on time. I use it often and create different looks day and night. Shades are pigmented and don't fall out when using a eye lid primmer.,5
I am not sure about this product. I read the great reviews and thought I would give it a try. I have used a few times and I do not like the results. I used just a small amount and my hair seems dirty or weighed down. Not really what I was looking for. I would not purchase this again.,3
"I'm happy I got this brush in exchange for my honest review.This brush it the right size and the bristles are the right stiffness for me.  The curved handle makes the brush manageable.  I like the fact that it comes with a string so I can hang it up to dry.For the price; I highly recommend this.  When it wears out, I'll get another one.",5
I haven't use this product yet but waiting for a month to do so. I will come back and let you know how it work.,4
These brushes are soooo soft! i mean for 19$ these brushes are great! The case it comes in does smell a little funny but it is adorable! also the shipping was so fast! the one bad thing is it doesnt have a blending brush so i did have to get a mac 217 brush but its all good(:,5
"I have been massaging my thighs and the backs of my arms with this cream for a week now and I am able to see some progress.  This skin on the back of my arms is visibly smoother.  The cream is thick so it allows you to really massage deep into your thighs.  It's working, who could ask for more.",5
this heats up really quickly and really hot. i did my whole head of hair (long & thick hair) in less than 15 minutes.,5
I live in dry desert climate and use this everyday on clean soaking wet hair. I scrunch out excess water and scrunch in Aussie volumizing mousse. This combo is better than any high end products I've tried and I try everything.,5
I love using this brush I'm new to applying powder on my brows and this brush makes it so much easier.,5
"I must admit I haven't used this product. I read what I could about it before ordering it and once it arrived and I looked at the ingredients list, I was appalled because the company touted it as being another ""natural"" product.This stuff has all the types of parabens women with, or previously had, breast cancer should avoid! It has been awhile since I have come across a product that still uses these preservatives. It's the reason I quit looking at products in professional hair salons. When will they stop? I know several breast cancer victims who avoid the parabens like the plague!I have come to the conclusion that just because it says natural it is rarely the case! Better off just to look for the organic versions.",1
"I still get headaches when I wear these, but they aren't as bad with these as with the regular ones.  I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more.  The hair doesn't slip on these, so that's nice.  However, they are very brittle and I've broken quite a few of these.",3
"i like them, but now i realize i dont need too many brushs for blush, so i use one or two of them, if you are a girl that uses a lot of different brushes for make up then they are a good choice",3
"I am fair-skinned and burn instantly. I was skeptical about trying an ""all natural"" sunscreen because I have come to depend on the routine chemicals that protect me from burning so I did a test. I put Cotz SPF 58 on one arm and Neutrogena 55 on the other. After several hours in the sun neither arm was burned. Bottom line: it worked.The Cotz has no scent. That is a huge plus for me. But like every other cream sunscreen out there, it has a greasy feel no matter what they claim. I'm not sure I would want it on my face on a daily basis. It is also a lot  more expensive than regular sunscreen, BUT doesn't have the chemicals that are harmful to the environments/coral reefs, so it's a trade-off.I give it four stars because it worked, it doesn't smell like anything, and because it protects the environment. It lost a star for cost and greasy feel.",4
"They're ok for the price, but they need more variety and sizes. The first thing I noticed when I looked at these brushes is that a lot of the brushes look the same, just slightly different sizes and a lot of the brushes bristles were bent out of shape due to the cheap casing.Also, the smell of the cheap pouch the brushes came in was not too pleasant and also made the brushes themselves smell bad, but a good cleaning should remedy this issue.Other than all that the brushes are ok for a starter set, which is all I was looking for. They are soft to touch and feel sturdy enough, but in the future I do intend on investing in better higher end brushes.Edit: 9/25/11So I cleaned these brushes to get rid of the terrible smell I mentioned earlier and the bigger face brushes are already falling apart and are still bent out of shape horribly. Now I don't mean one or two bristles falling off, I mean big chunks of bristles started coming off when I was drying them and no I'm not rough when drying my brushes. I NEVER had this issue with any of my other face brushes that I was using before I got these and they're only cheap Wal Mart/Price Chopper brand brushes.Thankfully the eye brushes held up ok and are still usable, which is the main reason I bought this kit in the first place, but now after seeing this I will definitely be saving up for better quality brushes.",3
"OMG this product name/claims make it APPEAR to be &#34;natural&#34;, but its made out of horrible chemicals:....

"The Remington Shine Therapy Flat Iron is a dream compared to myConair CS3B Ceramic Straightener, Power of Pink, 1 Inchthat I purchased a couple of years ago. Unlike the Conair, the Remington's plates do not snag my hair, so no more breakage! It seems to give a nice sheen to my hair but I'm not sure if it is because of the adjustable heat control not drying my fine locks out or if it's attributed to the oil infused plates like the description boasts. I'm hedging towards both to be quite honest.To me, this flat iron is worth its weight in gold. I have had nothing but success and not a single complaint (yet). This one comes highly recommended!",5
This product is best used on feet-totally helps with odor and sweat.  Plus its all natural-no harmful chemicals or metals.,5
"I had a rash inside me nose and in other parts f my body.  This ointment worked; the rash is completely gone.Con.: the amount they give is very little, so it's not good value for the money",5
The packing on this is not my favorite but the product inside of it is worth every bit of small work it takes to get into your hands and then on your locks.  It smells wonderful I can't stress that enough smell is so huge for me when it comes to hair products. It is going to leave your hair so soft and workable with any hair style. It works great on your ends and you don't have to worry about build up on your scalp. Never a waxy or oily strand of hair to be seen with this product. Works best the longer you let set but I wouldn't recommend more than 5 minutes and rinsing with warm water more towards the colder side to lock in the treatment on your hair.,5
"I use regular Biosilk with a Chi iron.  Sometimes, I use this spray, VERY lightly the next day for touch ups with the Chi.  Be sure to use it lightly or your hair will look greasy and/or unclean.  Hair that is thick, dry or curly would probably not have this same problem.  It is a definite hair tamer.",4
They are good dotting pens. Love the colors and size. The smaller sizes done seem to be much different in ball size but then again that could be my eyes. Good product I love them.,5
Not what I expected. I realy don't like the smell. Love the chaz products but won't order this again. It is like putting smelly water on your hair or skin.,3
It doesn't have much of a smell and definitely does not make you tingle. I would not purchase it again.,2
"The pink is much more flesh-toned (at least for me) than I expected, and the brown for your crease is more tannish in person. That being said, the colors still are very nice and put together well. I was actually *COMPLIMENTED* on my eye shadow as I wore this! That's never happened before! I use neutrals for work since I'm in more of a holistic profession, and these are neutral enough to wear and not look crazy.",5
"This lip gloss is really thick. You have to rub pretty well to evenly spread the color on your lips. And, you only get a very small amount of lip gloss for each dip. I find myself using 3-4 dips to apply the color. The color itself is fine.",4
Ok but not perfectly.  Recommends buying 3 bottles for full treatment.  I used one bottle and my stretch marks are lesser but not totally gone.  Terrible scent.,4
"These are not very good.  They are not absorbant, and the layers fall apart easily.  I would not purchase again.",1
"This is a very light, pleasant scent-- unlike many kids' products, it's not cloying. My bottle says ""Cherry Vanilla Soda,"" but they must have changed it to ""Cherry Vanilla Bop"" recently. I don't think I would have identified that as the scent, but whatever it is, it's both kid-friendly and grown-up friendly.I had to do some experimenting to figure out how much product to use and where to use it-- the bottle says to use 2 pumps, from roots to tips of hair. That wasn't enough for us-- I tried it on my daughter and myself and it didn't seem to do anything. Then I tried doing 4 pumps in her hair (which is long and wavy) and the top of her hair got crunchy and flat. So we're settling on 3 pumps, and less on top! It's a minor difference in any case, but does seem to cut back on the frizz a little.",3
I like these gloves they exfoliate well and last without falling apart or getting soft.They are MUCH better than those puff scrubs as these gloves last longer and don't fall apart.,4
"This is a very affordable product. The results provided from this product are comparable to Nexxus and Paul Mitchell. Even better, a little goes a long way!It smells very nice (even my husband remarked on the light, pretty scent)and I will definitely be buying this product again. Highly recommended.",5
"Does a great job of brightening up complexion.  I use the mask once a week to rid my face of dead skin, tighten pores and clear up any blemishes.  The cool mint is refreshing and rejuvenating.  Love this stuff.",4
Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &Modern. All at a good price!!! A must have nail art product,5
"I just started using this product and it seems to work o.k.  It does ""soften"" the cuticle and makes it easier to push and remove with a cuticle pusher/remover but I'm not sure if used alone it would remove cuticle by itself...the bottle is HUGE, so I am going to have it for a long, long time...",4
"Don't brother buying this crap. U get 12 glitters in teeny tiny pots and the colors are all the same basically. I got 5 pots of an ugly orangish ""glitter"" and 4 pots of black, along with 3 pots of red, all the same red. Its crappy glitter on top of that. The pots were almost all empty, and had spilled out so the pots are about 1/8th full. All this after I CONTACTED THE SELLER FIRST TO BE SURE I WOULD GET 12 DIFFERENT COLORS AND TO MAKE SURE THEYD CLOSE THEM TIGHT AND FILL THEM COMPLETELY. This jerk emailed me back and promised Id get 12 DIFFERENT colors and she'd make sure they were full and tightly closed. I waited 2 months to get this dissapointing mess of a package. I wasted my $ and hope no one else bothers with this as u will surely be unhappy. Also the glitter is not even like glitter. Looks more like tiny pieces of matte paper. Don't waste your money or time! !!!!!",1
"I hate to give this anything less than 5 stars simply because I am pro crazy hair colors and I love Blue so much. This is my first time however doing my own hair with such a bold and unique color and I intend on trying again and again til I achieve my beautiful blue. This however did not hold on my hair. I spots and my roots are brighter then ever with Blue. then the rest of my hair comes out looking gray which is not bad at all but the way its all looking on my hair looks messy and definitely looks like I ha dno idea what I was doing. I wet my hair this morning 2 days after I dyed it and blue just started drizzling down my face. If it was red I'd be a little freaked out. I wash my hair thoroughly so that may be the problem why it didnt stick. Also i put too much on my roots and had barely any left for the rest of my hair. But I conditioned it through. My front roots are all confused. They are either blonde, white or blue and I dont know how in the world they are not all blue since I wasted most of the dye on the front part. This brand is great with the colors and you need bleach blonde hair though to get the results and more then one box. I don't want pastel blue I want rich rich royal beautiful blue. So I will by 3 boxes in case. I will try again. Not sure of this brand but since its now available in my local store I might try it out again.Try it you may be able to do better then I did. I love the beautiful blue though  that comes out when it holds right.",3
This is a great cleaner for your makeup sponges.  Works well for eyeshadow brushes but not for concealer or powder brushes.  It last a long time and it doesn't irrate my skin or breakdown my makeup tools.,4
"The images of this lipstick make it look like it is much darker - but when I put it on my lips its more of a hot pink than it is a blue violet. I'll  eventually wear it, but its not what I thought it was.",3
I've tried many many products for my fine hair. This one is one of the products I really like and it's well worth the money.,5
I wrote a review elsewhere:) this is a must have for any makeup artist and beautiful ladies in all shapes and color. The product is awesome it is easy on the wallet and beautiful on the face.,5
"So wonderful, perfect. Love the scent, and yes it can be use by both men and ladies. It can also be worn sunny days or night time for out with friends, a wedding or b-day party. Its great!",5
"My hair is short, straight and fine so drying time, unfortunately, (what I wouldn't give for fantastic hair) has never been an issue with me. On that basis, I don't know that I'm qualified to review the finer points of a hand-held hair dryer and hence can only comment on its features and whether or not it does what it's supposed to do.The Remington D-2012 Salon Quality Ceramic Hair Dryer (with tourmaline) positions itself on its packaging against another dryer in the same price range (which I don't happen to own). It includes a concentrator and a diffuser, neither of which I have reason to use. Not unlike just about every other hand-held dryer on the market, it adjusts for both airflow and temperature. Its claim is that its AC motor lasts longer than DC motors; I have no means of verifying this. To be honest, I don't use the Remington D-2012 all that often because I keep it at my parents' house so that I don't have to travel with a dryer when I visit. However, it does a good job for me and even though it seems a tad flimsier than my other dryer (hence the one-star demerit), I can recommend it regardless.",4
"I'm Indian and have slightly wavy hair that's to my shoulder blades - that said, this is an awesome flat iron!  I had the Chi for many years before, which finally gave up on me, so my comparison is to that product.  With this iron, I can straighten my hair in about 10 min versus about 12 min with my Chi.  I think this is way better than the Chi though based on my hair after straightening.  My hair feels smooth and healthy and it's super shiny.  The Chi wasn't bad, but to me, this is way better.",5
As with all designer skin products this was a win!  Leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.  Fresh scent that is not overpowering.  My only complain is the shimmer...should have read the product description better.  Really don't like the glitter effect.,5
I am giving this product a 5 star because it is the best lipstick color I have ever tired. The lipstick goes on very nicely and does not dry your lips. Definitely try it if you are Indian :),5
"Although the picture is semi deceiving to the eye giving off the impression the container and rhinestones are larger than they seem, its actually pretty small. But otherwise GREAT products!",5
Keeps bottles  nice and organized.  It's maller than I thought but it still fits up to 36 bottles like it claims.,5
Feels and smells great,5
I don't know what this stuff is supposed to be. It's horrible. Makes your hair hard. Feels like you have hairspray in your hair for days...after several washings. Gross. Keep it!,1
I love it so much.. I keep buying it every time i need it... It really helps with the hot iron.  Prevents and repair damage.,5
"I have quite long hair and an intolerance for spending more than a few minutes setting my hair. I love this set--actually have two plus another I keep at a son and daughter's home out of state. I use the four jumbo rollers on the crown of my head and section fairly large sections of hair and use the smaller rollers. I leave in for about 2 minutes, pull them out, tease the crown a bit and am out the door in no time. Great product for me!",5
This is easier to put in hair and keeps the shiny and healthiness in and the frizz and fly aways out. I went outside so many times today and it definitely defies humdity.I like alot of different products Dove Aussie Herbal Essences John Frieda Tresemme Renpure etc. But I'm sticking with this.It works really really well. I have to have this my hair is really long and this makes all of my hair including the ends! smooth! And it's natural it's the best I will definitely buy it again when I run out.I even read once that over time the ammonium laureth sulfates in cheaper shampoos and conditioners eat away at hair follicles. Who knows for sure? But I know I like this alot and it works for me Thank God and secondly thank you L'oreal please don't take this off the market ever it's the best stuff I've ever used on my hair.,4
"This stuff has an amazing scent, leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped, only smooth and soft.  I don't use conditioner anymore - don't need it, even though I, um, enhance my natural hair color.  My stick straight hair has far fewer fly aways.  I'll never go back to shampoos with sulphates.",5
"I really wish this had worked.  I have extremely deep Stretch marks and have invested tons of money trying to find a product that helps.  I had hoped bio oil would be the one, but it wasn't.  After continuous use I noticed no change in my stretch marks.  It makes your skin feel wonderful and, for the price, it's a decent deal, but it did not work for me.",2
"Wella seems like a good conditioner for a drug store-type purchase. This product was just &#34;okay&#34; for me, but I'm spoiled because I usually use Alterna products.",2
I have asked 50 dermatologist about this lotion.  Not one of them knows what it is! It was hard for me to believe anyone recommended this lotion. I saw no hydration. Absolutely none! I have very dry mature skin. Save your hard earned money!Don't spend it on hype!,1
"Finally I have found a delicious, light, everyday scent. Not to heavy or over-powering, this refreshing apple scent is great for any day. Just ask my dog, she agrees with me.",5
personally im not a big fan ! i watched a youtube video about this product and fell in love but when i actually used it i wasnt a big fan !,3
I love my lashes I've been using them a lot lately & they are great. For this price its great i can't wait to purchase more.,5
Good deal for the price. Will absolutely order this product again when needed. Works even better than expected with Neutrogena's Microdermabrasion System. Pleased that a new attachment was included with the Puff Refills,5
my mother uses every moment is very good as it leaves hair hairdresser is very good buy buy buy pear brilliant in another,5
If you are looking for that perfect nude nail polish then look no more. Tickle My France-y is so beautiful on the nails and it takes forever to chip!,5
"A little goes a long, long way!What makes Vegetable Glycerin so great for those with dry skin and hair issues, is that Vegetable Glycerin has natural humectant-like properties, in that it pulls moisture from the air and binds it to the skin and hair.But, only use a tiny amount (whatever you think you need, use a fraction of that, as it can be very sticky (like honey or sugar) if too much is used.A few drops added to a base oil of jojoba Oil or Avocado oil make for an outstanding humectant head to toe body oil! And a few drops added to water makes a great spritz for reviving curls! And a few drops added to your favorite shampoo or deep conditioner treatment will leave dry hair- super duper soft!Overall, it is a great product and those with dry skin or dry hair issues love to add it to their homemade formularies for awesome results!For great usage tips go to Onlinecliniqueforum.forumotion.com  or/and Naturallycurly.com !Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!",4
Love this color,5
I usually get the smaller cases. This was packed with little gems in beautiful colors. I am having so much fun with it!!! I would buy some more in the future. In very satisfied with the Cheeky store services. You guys are tops!!!!,5
"It smells good, but it does not hydrate my skin at all.  It also has the mist of a typical bottle of hairspray.  There is nothing fine about the mist.  I would say it is a sprayer.  Not a mister.",1
"Along with occasional puffiness under the eyes I have mild-to-moderate dark circles. My wife is a Mary Kay director and has provided me with that companies dark circle remover which worked pretty well after about a month of use. Personally however, I prefer this one from Oz Naturals. I noticed the same result as the Mary Kay but in about half the time. Another thing I found more desirable was that this was a gel verses the Mary Kay which is more liquid. The price of both are abiut the same but all in all I'll stick with this one.",5
This is one of MAC's finest.  It has a violet undertone which makes this red is deep and rich in color and accommodating for nearly all skin tones. Awesome.,5
"I liked this product the first time I bought it but when I had run out I REALLY missed my morning spritz! I reordered and just love my post shower blast.  I follow with other Xfacio products and definitely see a difference.  My skin is firmer, smoother and younger looking.  My go to products for sure.",5
"I use this and a competitor product.  My manicure always peels off when I use this product.....stays on with competitor product.  I bought because of the price.  However, from now on I will spend the money for the better product.",3
"These are a little extra money but well worth it.  I recently purchased one of those huge 50 pack of eyelashes for 5.00 (or similar) because I wanted to learn how to put on fake eyelashes.  Those others are too cheap and too hard to work with.  Bite the bullet and pay a LITTLE extra for these because they are SO much easier to work with.  I purchased several types of Ardell on Amazon, but the wispies were my favorite!Also, maybe because I'm new at this, I haven't been successful at saving a pair. They don't look right on me after I've used them once.",5
My nails look like a Tilt-a-Whirl.  Just a beautiful classic red with a TON of sparkle!  Great coverage with two coats.,5
"very gentle, a little goes a long way. smells nice, and hasn't irritated my skin in anyway. I've been using it a few weeks and is less drying than what I was using before.",5
"I don't think I ever want to go without Eminince Courperose-c serum. Since I have been using it my face has benefitted highly from the serum. In fact, most people have no idea I am over 60, but think, due to my complexion that I am in my 40's.",5
"I have thin hair, so a volumizing shampoo is always in my shower - and usually more than one brand. This shampoo has joined my rotation (I read somewhere once that the best way to keep hair clean, and detangled was to rotate shampoos because if you constantly use the same shampoo, it can build up on your hair in a gross way). This has a very strong minty/citrus/herbal smell to it, so I can see how this may not appeal to every user - but it is a pleasant combination, if a bit overpowering at first.The shampoo lathers well and leaves hair feeling clean. I haven't noticed any dramatic difference in volume, but I have also been using this in connection to other products (conditioner, leave-in sprays or gels), so I can definitely say that it is at least consistent with my other volumizing shampoos by John Frieda, Pantene and Aussie. Generally, I like it - it is not a life-changing shampoo, but it certainly is a pleasant one.",4
"I love love, love salt exfoliates, they really are amazing for skin health. I also have loved using all the Adovia products.This Adovia exfoliating salt works rather easily, just remember to start with a freshly washed & wet face. I wash my face with vinegar water, rinse then gently massage into circles all over face, do not scrub, be very gentile yet firm. It should not feel like you are using sandpaper on your face, rather you should feel the gentle cleaning & massaging effect of the salt as it removes dead skin & massages your skin improving circulation. Then rinse off with warm water, follow with your favorite moisturizer, I prefer raw coconut oil.The exfoliating & massaging action leaves your face tingly in a good way & feeling more alive & looking radiant. Salt is great in skin care because it is naturally antiseptic, while removing excess oils, salt is also great for giving your skin needed minerals for a younger healthier looking you.Adovia says this dead sea salt is formulated for oily skin but it does work great on my combination skin as well as helping heal skin issues I tend to get during the summer. My skin feels soft & alive after every use, I love using this on my face, no more blackheads.Just a word of warning open slowly & on a flat surface the first time, or you will lose some of the salt from the jar, because it is literally a jar of dead sea salt (I love that by the way). I had read to be careful & still spilled some. But not to worry it is a nice size container & is a 2 month supply so as long as you open it the first time & only lose some you will have plenty to love.I also found this great as a body scrub when mixed with coconut oil & a few drops of argan oil, jojoba oil & rosehip oil. Try it you will love it.Give it a try, it is awesome!",5
"This was my first purchase with Sigma, I was referred to them thru a friend who is on You Tube. These brushes are amazing! I have really been missing out on proper makeup application. This set has a combo of natural bristle brushes and synthetic, I will be using every one. The powder brush is so luxurious, great contour brush, great precision eye brushes, I can't say enough great things about them except I'm very happy I made the investment in this set! I highly recommend this set to anyone who has been working with subpar brushes and hasn't been happy with applying makeup in the correct way. I'm going back to purchase some for my daughter!",5
Been using this for weeks now and have had no issues with it.  It does the trick and I love the results.,5
"I like the ""instant radiance"" that this cream provides - it adds a subtle luminosity to my skin that doesn't look artificial. The light tint (I have the light/medium) is a nice feature too, I can use this alone or under my foundation. The cream has a stronger scent than others I've used, but it's not unpleasant or overpowering. The sunscreen is a great feature as well. I am in my early 50's and I appreciate a product designed to nourish and improve the look of my skin.",4
"love love love these, i bought 4 sets and they are just amazing. i feel if i hadnt gotten these my brushes whould most likely be all messed up so this product is beyond amazing and i think any girl or guy that does makeup should have these for their brushes",5
The highlight side definitely brightens by eyes and covers up the bags I've acquired since losing a lot of sleep (newborn baby).The concealer is okay. I will probably buy this again!,4
The first thing that came to my mind when I first tried it was &#34;OMG it's so black!&#34;. It's amazing. ;D,5
"Even with a dishwasher, there is no way to avoid washing pots and pans.  Added to general housecleaning and cold weather, it's a formula for chapped hands.  This cream is thick and leaves a protective coating without feeling greasy or sticky.  You only need a little at a time because it is so thick and it does smell good.  Keep it in the kitchen.",5
"I've purchased many different Axe shower gels before because I usually like most of their bold / manly scents.  However, the only thing I like about this shower gel is that it cleans.  Other than this the fragrance is extremely off-putting to me as it smells almost like I'm washing myself with menthol or Vicks VapoRub. Also, the gel does not lather up as well as I would like.Even though I'm a female, many of my body washes are labeled for men only as I like their deep fragrance and the clean way they make me feel.  Nevertheless, I definitely would not purchase this shower gel for myself particularly because of the scent.",2
"Saw and read a dozen reviews on the Revlon Colorstay. The product took longer to get to me than most of my Amazon orders, but still in estimated time. Product goes on so well and matches my skin tone flawlessly. Blends in really good with blending sponge and stippling brush. Long-lasting and beautiful finish.",5
"I love this little blemish stick. Love the medicinal smell, the way it feels when it hits my skin. My skin has cleared tremendously with another system I have been using. Well I still get an occasional hormonal pimple. Which is nothing compared.to before. Well I am a picker also. Will pick at a pimple until there is a nasty scar & it will linger for months from the picking. Well anytime I get the urge to pick, I slater this lovely.stuff on. It not only is helping to kill the bacteria in the blemish, but also keeps me from picking. I will not be without this product!!!",5
"Remember the commercial &#34;Where's the beef?&#34;  Well, when I applied this blush I said out loud &#34;Where is it?&#34;  This is more like a &#34;glow&#34; than a blush.  I realize each person will get a different result depending on her complexion and the products she applies under it, but I will definitely not be ordering this blush again.  The case is very nice, however.  It's much sturdier than the NYX blush, and there's a lot of product, plus a small mirror.  I'll probably use this as a highlighter or just give it away.  At least it was only $3.",2
"It better than any brush, sponge or even hand/finger application of foundation and concealer.  Follow the directions closely to make it work its magic.",4
love the ergonomic shape of the sponge. its durable and easy to clean...spreads the foundation well. its a must have beauty tool,5
I been looking for body lotion that smell like cocoa butter I found . it smell so good its not thick like other body lotion that's a good thing. affordable price.,5
"My husband shaves in the shower, and his previous shower mirror was always falling off the wall and getting fogged up. Every so often, we'd hear a loud noise, and sure enough the mirror would be lying on the floor of the shower. So, when I told him that we had the opportunity to review the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror, he was definitely eager! However, I knew he was a little skeptical about how fog-free it would be because he chose to set it on a little shelf in the shower rather than affix it to the wall. (Apparently, he didn't want it to be too permanent in case he didn't like it!) Well, he used it for several weeks, and one day I peeked in the shower and saw that he had affixed the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror to the wall!Obviously, this product is a big ""keeper"" and a permanent part of his shower routine! We're thrilled to report that it has never fallen off the wall. Plus, my husband loves that it never fogs up. No more rubbing on it mid-shave to try to get a clear view of his face. Other great features include an adjustable frame so you can angle it just right, a convenient shelf for placing your razor or other shower tools, and even a squeegee for wiping away water drops. It's shatter-proof and rust-proof, so it should last a long, long time.Having a mirror in the shower is also handy for tweezing and checking to be sure you've washed off all the soap and/or shampoo. We love the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror, and I think you will, too! This would make a fantastic holiday gift for the hard-to-buy-for guy.",5
"This product is so good for aging skin, fine line, and wrinkles.  It isn't greasy or oily, has no odor.",5
After researching..I decided to purchase this hyaluronic acid serum..very good choice I made..makes my skin feel lovely and really seems to be doing wonderful things..I don't want to be without  this as I also do derma rolling and this product seems great in conjunction with that process..I highly recommend,5
I haven't tried all the designs as there are always some in every set that don't suit you.  This set has a nice variety and the plates that I have tried have been well engraved and transferred clear images.,5
"I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for 2 years and I recommend to everyone. The texture and spots improved within 2 months. The Retinol in it helps in achieving that. I use throughout the year, sometimes supplementing it with another Neutrogena Ageless Intensives products during winter.",5
"This set makes it so easy to add a little ""something"" to your look without any permanent changes.  This kit includes everything you need at a fraction of what salons would cost.",5
"I am in my late 20s, so please take it into consideration, but I really don't like this make up remover.OIL-BASEDIt has oil in it! After a few days taking my mascara off with this product, I got an ugly, huge pimple under my eye. Since it is in the delicate eye skin area, there is not much I can do about it, just wait... Well, today is a 4th day and it is still far from disappearing :( If you have oily, combination skin like me, please think twice before you get this oil-based make up remover.EASY TO SPILL / CONTAMINATEOnce you take the cap off, there is nothing to make the &#34;hole&#34; smaller, you just stare right into the bottle. Is that even hygienic?DOES NOT REMOVE MASCARA EASILY NOR SMOOTHLYI have hard time to remove my Lancome mascara (regular, not water-resistant). It did not feel smooth on my eyes at all. I was more satisfied with a cheap Sephora eye make up remover than this one.",2
"I have been using SUAVE products for years. This particular one, 2 in 1 Alpine Fresh, is a combination shampoo conditioner. It leaves my scalp clean and my hair soft and manageable. This is a great product and although it is listed as alpine fresh, it does not have a lingering smell.Contains moisturizers and leave the scalp feeling clean and refreshed. The lather rinses quickly from the head.",5
I love the red color. Wigs are not as cool as I thought they were but it's still pretty nice.,3
I haven't used them a lot but I'm getting ready to do my nails so I'm hoping it will help lean over the base coat bottle that's getting empty.,4
"I never understood why people spent hundreds on straighteners I feel this does just as good of a job. I have waist length hair, not too heavy but not that thin either. It heats up quickly and reduces frizz as well and i'm done with my styling fairly fast.",5
The Derma Roller 0.5 / 1.0 - Best Dermaroller System For Younger Beautiful... was my beginner roller after a while when i got more comfortable with the procedure. I bought the Dermapen for the face and kept the .Derma Roller 0.5 for doing a large burn scar. A larger roller takes less time so it is great for this application.,5
Works great for lashed. Seemed to work quickly too. I could tell after a week and a half.,5
This is cruelty free and organic.  Feels great on my skin.  I wear it instead of foundation for a natural glow.  It covers well.,5
This is amazing!!!! its a light scent and it last all day. it almost reminds me of SNOOKI For Women By NICOLE POLIZZI or the pink bottle with the black pin stripes by Paris Hilton as well. i will definitely purchase again.,5
L'Oreal lipstick is always good.  This shade was beautiful and it had free shipping as well which made me happy too.  I would buy this again.,5
My 3yr old has fine thin hair that gets tangled easily and it murderous to detangle even with these sprays they sell now. This brush has made it pain free and now my daughter doesn't mind me brushing her hair. Win win!,5
"I have always been a fan of Jonh Frieda products because they were the only products that seemed to help with frizzy, damaged and dried-out hair.  Although I have always had nice hair (long, slightly wavy) there was a time when my hair became so damaged due to highlighting, the sun, coloring and worst of all perming.  That is when I learned about these nifty hair products that were amazing.  I liked the fact that:1.  They actually work.2.  They are affordable3.  You can find them at your local stores (think CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Target)It has been years since I used John Frieda products since I stopped doing all that stuff to my hair once I had my daughter.Fast forward to now.  As much as I hate to admit, at 45 years of age, I am now starting to get the gray hairs, not much but enough to scare me into coloring my hair.  Of course, I would prefer to be able to go to a salon to get my hair colored every 6 to 8 weeks but I am not wealthy enough for that.  LOL.  I do what every woman on a budget does - I color my hair at home.  I didn't really have a favorite hair color brand although I tended to favor those that had more natural ingredients (like Garnier).  One day while I was shopping at Targets, I noticed that John Frieda sold hair color.  Needless to say, I picked one and went to pay for it.The greatest things about the John Frieda hair color is that it is a foam.  One of the things that I and most women dread when coloring our hair, is getting it on our skin, clothes or sink.  With this foam, I did not have even a small accident.  It was the easiest and less messy hair color product I have used.  It looks like your putting mousse in your hair.  The color is awesome (if you choose the right shade).Since I am a brunette, I like to experiment with hair colors.  No, I don't use blonde color so that my hair turns orange.  I sometimes color it darker or I add a red color to make my hair &#34;look&#34; like it has chestnut highlights.  This Glosser is a perfect compliment to the John Frieda hair color and it also comes in a foam.  You don't have to use an excessive amount and each week your hair looks like you just colored it.  This product is great because it makes your hair color always look healthy and it extends the life of your color, thereby using less money and time to color your hair at the 6 to 8 weeks timeframe.I normally don't use conditioner on my hair because I have such fine hair so when using this product once a week, I pretend I am giving my hair a deep conditioning.  Which is ironic because I actually am conditioning my hair when using this product otherwise my hair would not look so shiny and healthy.",5
I love that this product comes with both a dropper and a pump so the user can decide which way they want to get the product out of the bottle. I prefer using the pump when I apply the product as it give me better control of the amount of serum that comes out. This product is easy to use as you just rub a few drops into your skin. The serum is thicker than most vitamin C serums and has a light aloe scent to it. It absorbs fast to allow you to wear your favorite lotion over it.I have been using this product for about two weeks and I have notice that my skin looks better. I have a more even skin tone and my fine lines are less noticeable and I am able to leave the house without makeup on. I also have noticed that my skin is softer and I am able to use less lotion on my face.,5
"Hair dryers are one of life's necessary products and even though I rarely use them, I still recognize the need and that is part of the reason I own this hair dryer from Vidal Sassoon. I rarely use a hair dryer but even with my limited usage, I can clearly see the advantages of owning a hair dryer like this one. First, it is nice to have three different heat settings and two different air flow speeds. I have owned simpler devices before that only offered two heat settings and one speed. On warm heat and high airflow, my hair is completely dry in about two to three minutes. There is a higher heat setting that would probably do the trick even faster but I avoid this setting because it is too hot on my head.Vidal Sassoon Professional also offers special attachments and added features that make it a good choice for those with longer hair and special hair problems. One added feature is the ionizer. This is easily turned on or off using the switch on the top of the hair dryer. Ionization, I have been told, seals in moisture, makes the hair dry faster, and eliminates frizziness. This feature is very nice for those with longer hair because it can help lessen the need for conditioner and other hair products.The diffuser that comes with this hair dryer is very good and quite large in size. It is very effective because of its size and because it has so many prongs (12 in total). It makes curly hair look very nice, diffusing the heat in an efficient manner so that no small area is getting blasted with excess heat.Other features on this hair dryer include a cold blast feature and the straightening device. The cold blast is designed to quickly blast the hair with cold air to help hold a style in place and it probably works best on those with long, straight hair. The straightening device is, again, for people who have straight hair, want to straighten their hair, or want only a small amount of wave. It isn't useful to us but it seems to be a good attachment and it easily snaps on and off the front of the hair dryer.Overall, this hair dryer is a very good device that performs to near perfection on people with short hair (like most any hair dryer) and works well for those with longer hair thanks to the additional features and extra attachments. Add to that the three heat levels, two speeds, and 1875 watts of power and you have the makings of a professional hair styling device- one that offers the essential features to give most people the final results they want at a low cost.",4
Bought this because I was starting to do my own nails.  It saved some time over using a hand file but............I only used it about 6 times and it stopped working.  Glad it didn't cost too much but still out a few bucks....Not happy.,1
My skin is looking and feeling smooth and happy. I really like this product. A little goes a long way. I use it on damp skin with damp fingertips.,5
"This top coat is great. I gave it four stars because it isn't &#34;water-chip&#34; proof lol I usually do a lot of house cleaning (usually involving water) and when I get in water my polish doesn't last long and this top coat doesn't help much. Other than that this top coat makes your polish last  a good two weeks and is very shiny. It also dries really quick, living up to its name &#34;Out the Door&#34;.  I do recommend this top coat though, the best so far that I've used",4
I have a very sensitive scalp. This products works great on my hair and scalp. It smells great. I will order more and share with my family and friends.,5
I have a coughing allergy I developed once we moved to Maryland several years ago. I also cough in cold weather as part of this. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night in my cool house if I didn't have these great masks to wear. And such a great price for 50. You can spend this much on a similar product at Walmart for 10 or 20 masks at the most.,5
nice for the price. they work pretty well but do need to be treated gently as the thing that holds the brushes in isn't so great. so no rough handling.,5
So I haven't exactly used this product yet but Ive heard very good reviews about dropping one to two dots into your Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat if it starts to get gummy and it restores it to like new again. So I bought this along with a bottle of the Seche Vite Top Coat. I have confidence it will work like it says,5
"I love this brush!  Firstly the packaging was very hygenic and it shipped very quickly!  I had never heard of Beauty Junkees until I mentioned to a colleague that I needed to buy some extra brushes I was told that there was a brush out there that was much cheaper than the brush I was using. By much, I mean a lot $$$.  Good quality non-shedding brushes are important to me because I am a Makeup Artist.  I highly recommend this brush company (Beauty Junkees) to anyone, but mostly to all aspiring MUA trying to build their kit.  I first used it with liquid because I wanted to see how well it blend and not make creases more pronounced and I was very impressed. It worked just as well as a brush I paid 3x more for.  I decided to clean the brush and let it dry to see how well it worked with powders.  (They indicate on the packing that you can use it for multiple purposes and I wanted to put it to the test).  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I concealed under eye discoloration and made bags disappear, used liquid to create precise contouring, used it as a brow highlighter, above the cupids bow highlighting and much more.  Again I cannot speak highly enough of this product and will probably do a youtube review because I think the brush is just that good!  I will definitely be purchasing a few more brushes from this company.",5
"Overjoyed with this product! Whatever makeup need you have, this set will cover it! A few brushes seem a bit repetitive but it's nice to have 2 that work the same way for styles that require multiple colors or multiple brushes. Don't worry about a scent or shedding, just give them a good wash (like you should with any new brush!) before using.",5
Much to my surprise I found these to be very close to the first brand I had purchased.  It was an excellent price for the large assortment of designs. I highly recommend this kit.,5
"The shampoo does a great job and the scent is not too strong - although it does linger. You can smell it hours later if you rub your fingers through your hair. The label is a little misleading - the beneficial effects are if you use the conditioner. It's like selling a bike and stating you'll set records. IF you use the optional shift, brakes and seat. So, as a shampoo - great. The other benefits? Nope.",4
"I loved samples, the mascara is good, the concealer works! I haven't used the primer yet or the lip stuff.",5
"Hold it farther away from your hair than you normally would because the spray &#34;velocity&#34; is pretty harsh.  After finally getting the front just the way I wanted it, I went to spray it and blew the whole thing apart!  In a hurry at the time, I didn't appreciate having to re-do my re-do, especially since it was harder to style with the sort of sticky-weight of the hair spray.  But I soldiered on and fixed it up, then held the hair spray further (doggonit, is it farther or further?) away to spray this time.  I also held the button for just a short burst, so as not to overload it.  Came out better the second time.  That being said, I didn't like the feel of it for a few hours, not exactly crunchy but still weighted-down and a tad sticky.  Much later in the day, it loosened up a bit and felt more comfortable.I am surprised that some reviewers didn't like the scent, because I have a pretty keen sniffer and didn't pick up anything bothersome at all in the smell.  HOWEVER (and that's a big &#34;however&#34;), I've used this spray a half dozen times since my first less-than-stellar experience with it, and I'm retiring it.  I'm sure it's an individual thing, but my humble opinion is that it's just too heavy.  I have long, thick, naturally-curly hair, but I only really wanted the hold for the area framing my face, and although I absolutely want a maximum hold there, I just didn't like the texture of this hair spray.  It felt yucky.  I rarely do negative reviews, and I just hate saying it, but for my type of hair and what I'm looking for in a hold, this just didn't do it.I passed it on to my mother, who has thin, straight hair, on the shorter side.  Shockingly, she loves it.  Her only complaint was the powerful blasting from the can itself when you spray it, but that's easy to fix by holding it further/farther (grammar police, I apologize).  Of course, her arms aren't long enough to really do that, but that gives us something else to tease my tiny mom about anyways.As for this Cristophe hair spray, our advice is:  if you really want a heavy hold, that won't budge, this may be the spray for you.  If you've used other Cristophe products and like them, this may be the spray for you.  And the biggest thing we loved about it is that it had no scent that we could notice, which is so refreshing.  We absolutely hate scented hair products, and this was neutral for us.  Hope this review helped you in some way.",3
"I would like to meet an Axe marketer one day just to see how he or she comes up with what they put on their packaging.  Their latest product is &#8220;Harmony&#8221; (whatever that means) which claims to be &#8220;body-calming.&#8221;  And of course on the back it suggests that this shower gel will make &#8220;you feel the balance to impress girls with your sense of inner peace.&#8221;  Alrighty.  Though it is debatable if my luck with the ladies increased after using Harmony, I definitely became cleaner afterwards. The scent itself is pleasant, subtle, and not overwhelming even if it did not leave me more harmonious; exactly what I expected from Axe, a solid product with an absurd marketing plan behind it.",4
"I hate lipstick, it dries my lips out. This a great alternative... because you get some awesome color on your lips & yet you get to keep them moisturized as well. Maybelline Shine Sensational is the best of both worlds. I especially love this color in particular. Not too pink... it's perfect.",5
"This is by far my favorite serum.  It does exactly what it supposed to do:  restores your skin to its natural glow without making it oily or drying it out.  It is not sticky and skin feels smoother just after a few minutes.  After using it for a month, I noticed a change in my skin. Even if I pulled an all-nighter, this serum helps erase any ""tired"" lines from my face.  It is also ideal if you live in cold dry climate as it helps decrease any redness.",4
"It actually took my longer to figure out exactly how to use this than it did to just use the plates without. It's a nice little tool but if you are going to try nail stamping just jump in with both &#34;hands&#34;. It takes practice and patience whether or not you use this or do it &#34;free hand&#34; so to speak. Either way once you get brave enough and gain some confidence you'll see that it saves time, nail polish and cleaning if you just skip this step. I gave it a three because there is nothing wrong with the product and if you are skittish about the whole stamping idea maybe it will give you a little boost of confidence. Or like me make it seem like a wasted and unnecessary step that seemed to make it sound more complicated than it really is.",3
these are cool i really like them.. theyre not cheap at all they have a nice weight to them. theyre all mixed together so you have to sort them yourself which isnt a problem for me,5
I am 61 and have always had paper thin nails. I have long nails now - after about a month of use! I am not sure it it is working for the flashes but they do seem less severe. I will be using this from now on.,5
I have been wanting to get a wide tooth comb for quite a while. I have very very thick curly hair and combing is such a pain. I have this and it works wonders!!,5
This product is a two-fer.  The two products are joined together into one tube with an applicator at each end which makes it very convenient and easy to apply and the fragrance is pleasant. You can feel a very slight tingle on the lips from the lip plumper and the collagen filler is basically a moisturizing treatment.,4
"The Olay products are a true value.  The quality is good and so is the price. I can pay a much higher price and not have as good of a product. It works well. I'm never going to stop the aging process, nor am I going to receive a miracle, but I can do all that I can to take care of my skin. I can pay more. I can pay less.  Olay products are quality for a good price.",5
"This dispenser is way to poorly made and designed for the price!When you push down, the liquid spurts out all over the place. You have to be very careful to gently push down very lightly and that is so frustrating when you bought it to make nail polish painting/removing easier.Thumbs down! I hate writing negative reviews unless I'm very unhappy with the product.",1
This has become my 7 yr olds favorite shampoo. It's just the right amount of conditioner to make combing easy and not leave hair feeling greasy or like it needs to be washed again. The scent is light and clean smelling. It suds up enough to wash well without dripping all over. Can't beat the price for a great kids shampoo.,5
"It's a good foundation and doesn't have a pinkish tone to it. The only problem I have about this foundation is that when I put it on, I can always see the foundation streak or it looks dryish. I think it might be bc I'm using a brush to apply it and I might have to use a sponge, but overall it's alright bc it gives a really nice glowy appearance and covers most little scars and imperfections",3
"Its pretty...Its very pigmented and shimmery I like everything about it ... besides it's too lime green for me, but maybe for green eyes it would be perfect .",4
"About five months ago, after my morning shower, I started itching, especially my arms and legs. Then one evening, I had anintense burning and itching on my arms. I went to my dermatologist and she recommended using Free & Clear cleanser. I havenothing bad to say about this product. Initially, I ordered two of the smaller pump bottles, and now I'm ordering the 32 ozbottles as refills for the pump containers. I'm on my second 32 oz bottle and couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommendthis cleanser!",5
"The fragrance is mild but soothing and the ingredients have lots of good stuff like sunflower, almond, and coconut oils, as well as aloe. It's not too heavy or greasy, so application to the scalp doesn't affect the overall appearance of your hair. I've found it helps with dandruff, too.",5
"Keeps nail polish on longer. Keeps the top hard and protects from scratches and smudges. I love it so much, it is defenitly a must",5
"As far as functionality, this is a wonderful towel.  It is soft as described and soaks up a lot of water.  I use it on my hair on a regular basis and it definitely absorbs more water than my traditional bath towel, and it is so much lighter to keep on my head!  The reason I gave it 3 stars was the fact that the towel is high maintenance.  The instructions said to wash it separately before use- so I hand washed it, and wow the black dye wouldn't stop running out of the towel.  I was surprised that the towel was still black when I was done.  I am too afraid to wash it in my machine with other items. This is not practical in my world, I can't be worried about a towel that &#34;runs.&#34;  If that doesn't bother you, then this is a wonderful towel for you.",3
This polish looks great on so many different colors. Very versatile and fun! I would recommend this one for your nail polish collection.,4
She has used Nexxus products her whole life and was very excited to be trying this product for the first time. She used it over several days and I asked her for a brief review of what she thought about the product.First off she liked the packaging and the bottle it came in. I guess that is a big deal for her. She liked the way that it made her hair feel. She said after the first use that she noticed a change and liked the feeling of her hair when putting her fingers through her hair after the product was administered throughout.She said she would buy in the future.,4
"I absolutely love body oils and use them all the time -Grapeseed oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil and pure vitmain E oils (Jason Naturals is the best for vitamin E oil) all of it my skin just drinks in and loves, so when I saw this product I was really intrigued.It's been a long time since I've used a non-natural brand, but I used to love Palmer's Cocoa Butter products when I was in high school and wanted to give this a try ---big mistake! I should've read through the ingredients list first. Not only does this irritate my skin but I find that the FIRST (which means the most concentrated) ingredient in this product is (super, super cheap) canola oil!Canola oil does NOT have the same skin-healing properties as say, pure sweet almond oil or grapeseed oil. Canola oil is one of the CHEAPEST oils out there -and it is genetically modified (meaning, they've taken the DNA of something foreign -like a fish and inserted the gene into the DNA of the plant -creating something that nature would never allow; if you don't know what GMOs are do a quick google search or youtube search -they're unnatural and have been proven to cause tumors, cancers, etc (Google GMO corn study France, then click to view images. You don't even need to read an article. Just use your eyes. You will see pictures of rats absolutely laden with tumors and cancers, especially breast cancer (conveniently our FDA trusts the GMO companies to do their OWN safety studies, and then takes them at their word. OTHER COUNTRIES do their own studies, and prove that GMOS cause cancer and then make them illegal; we are the LAST developed first world country to allow GMOS in our foods)). I try not to eat these genetically modified foods, so I certainly don't want them on my body!I feel like this product is a scam. Especially since I've bought and used so many wonderful natural body oils that actually have healing properties.Do yourself a favor --don't buy this product. If you want REAL results for your skin, buy some grapeseed oil (Now Foods brand is awesome; best prices are on amazon and at swanson vitamins website), some Rose Hip Seed Oil (seriously the BEST anti-aging essential oil there is; comes in a little bottle but is super concentrated; just google all the wonderful things this oil does for your skin!), and some pure vitamin E oil (I swear by the Jasons Naturals brand; best prices also here on amazon or Swanson vitamins online). Use up a little bit of the grapeseed oil (for face and body) and then mix in the rose hip seed oil and vitamin E oil in with it -and then you've got one of the BEST anti-aging, anti-stretch mark, anti-discoloration, all natural body oils available!I can't believe I didn't check this out more thoroughly. You might as well just use straight canola oil or vegetable oil from your kitchen on your skin if you're going to buy this product (which, I've known people who do this, especially before tanning; but it's a LOT cheaper when it's labeled for what it actually IS, not $8 for a small bottle with pretty packaging!).The second ingredient after canola oil is a chemical and THEN they add in tiny amounts of healing natural oils. :( I normally don't write a ton of reviews for products unless I'm really passionate one way or the other, but on this product I HAD to write something!Buy something that actually WILL heal your skin. I have personally faded stretch marks, old acne scars, AND faded emerging wrinkles (I'm 26) all using a combination of rose hip seed oil -Jason Naturals 45,000 IU vitamin E oil (super, super concentrated; higher IU is better), and grapeseed oil. I don't even spend the $80 every few months on Estee Lauder anti-aging products anymore this combination works so well. I have two bottle mixtures -one with super concentrated vitamin E oil, rose hip seed oil, and a little bit of grapeseed oil mixed in that I use solely on my face and neck, and the other (larger) bottle of more grapeseed oil with rose hip seed oil and vitamin E oil mixed in (in smaller amounts) for my body. Sometimes I use Sweet almond oil instead of grapeseed oil or I make a mixture with coconut oil (coconut oil is a super thick oil). Also, I have used Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil (which -it smells like EVOO of course, so I only use it when I'm out of my other oils, but it seriously gives me awesome results as well). ALL of these oils have potent anti-aging and healing properties for skin. (I also add in lavender essential oil to make my body oil smell really good).Also, something else that has made a HUGE difference in my skin is taking a good multivitamin (I recommend Garden of Life Raw One for Women; they are the best!) and taking Resveratrol (anti-aging and anti-cancer; I take a Resveratrol Complex that also contains grape seed extract in their formula, because grape seed extract has been proven to outperform chemo in killing certain kinds of cancer cells --crazy amazing! God's version of healthcare is SO good! You can find info on the cancer studies on pubmed :)) and Alpha Lipoic Acid. Alpha Lipoic Acid is one that I would recommend if you want immediate and the most drastic results in your skin. This is one that within days of taking it you will see an immediate difference in your skin. It also is anti-aging. Google these, honestly, they are awesome! I take 600mg Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA for short) in the Swanson Vitamins brand (although any brand of this should be pretty much the same thing) and a formula with Resveratrol and Grape Seed extract every day. This little paragraph I have added as an update to my review, but was randomly on amazon (ordering more of my Raw One vitamins and some Resveratrol ironically) and decided I needed to put this in this review... Women deserve to know that we don't have to just accept stretch marks or wrinkles and we don't need to pay a fortune for ""anti-aging"" products that don't work!! I buy my ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid) for less than 8 dollars and I GUARANTEE it is actively correcting, healing, and smoothing (etc) WAY more than the expensive products I used to buy.But back to my review of this product:Anyway, I love body oils --but this oil is a total crap product. Cheap ingredients and GMO at that. At best it is just irritating my skin and at worst it is just making me angry that they are charging so much for such a cheap product. I used to love Palmers products --obviously not anymore. *Sigh* Palmer's brings back memories of high school, summers, the beach (an hour away; so we went all the time), and the pool at my best friends house... I always had a bottle in my bag for after sun... I hate that I'm writing a negative review of anything Palmers :( but this product deserves it :( and people deserve to be informed. Back to natural oils for my skin...P.S. Some extra info about Canola oil: It is made from the seeds of a plant called rape. During WWII the U.S. built a lot of ships and needed to buy a cheap industrial oil for lubricating the engine parts of those ships --and the cheapest oil available was rapeseed oil.The rapeseed oil industry started booming as a result, selling tons of it to lubricate engines and ship parts during the war, but after WWII ended and the U.S. no longer needed to buy tons of it the rapeseed oil industry was in trouble. The rapeseed oil producers had tons of oil but no one to sell it to. Their answer to this problem was to try to make rapeseed oil edible for humans, because naturally, it's not. If we were to eat it in its natural form with all its harmful erucic acid intact we would all develop something called Keshan's Disease and eventually die. :(Anyway, the rapeseed producers figured out a process to take most of the harmful erucic acid out of its rapeseed oil and needed a new name to distinguish this low acid oil (because everyone knew rapeseed oil was a cheap industrial oil, something to lubricate your car engine with -not something you'd eat). So, because this new low acid rapeseed oil was made in Canada they renamed it: Canadian Oil, Low Acid, which eventually became known as Canola Oil.That's how this oil became something that is now used in vegetable oils and apparently is now being sold as a cheap oil for companies wanting to make a massive profit by creating a pretty bottle and label and filling said bottle up with this cheap oil, a few chemicals, and then teeny tiny amounts of ACTUAL traditional healing oils (that have been used for thousands of years) and calling it ""Skin Therapy Oil.""My advice is to skip the whole giving Palmer's company a massive profit thing and just BUY the actual healing oils. No chemicals. No additives. No cheap ingredients. You can make them smell good with a few drops of lavender essential oil or any other essential oil you might like. Lemon and lavender are my favorites -just remember essential oils come in teeny tiny bottles and you only need to add a few drops to scent your big bottle of natural healing oil. :)And I also seriously recommend trying Alpha Lipoic Acid because it really does make your skin look amazing! Resveratrol does too, but I'd say that Resveratrol's effects are more noticeable over time whereas with ALA the anti-aging and smoothing/toning effects on skin are faster. Both are very safe (but of course research for yourself about them). Anyway, that's my two cents on both this product and on what actually DOES work for skin and actually does heal your skin and make it look better. :-)Since my review is so long already I might as well put this too. I learned everything I know about skincare a few years ago when I moved from one of the nicest climates in the U.S. to one of the driest (seriously I live in the desert!). My skin and hair suffered horribly and I realized that in just a few short months I was aging super super fast. I did SO much research into what I could do to combat this... The water here is hard water and full of calcium (and is rated one of the worst in the entire U.S. --a ZERO water pitcher filter lasts me about a week because there's so much stuff in the public water supply...). When I first moved here everyone told me how horrible the water was, how awful my skin and especially my hair would eventually look. I didn't believe it until it actually happened... that's when I knew there had to be SOMETHING I could do about it. I researched for hours trying to find the best products and things I could do to help my skin and hair... And now I know them and that's why, when I write a review like this, I feel like I should share them... :) It is amazing what happens when you start using products on your skin and hair that actually heal, nourish, and protect, and can really make a huge difference... Also to anyone with emerging spider veins or varicose veins (these run in my family... REALLY wish they didn't) lotion or oil that contain vitamin K rubbed on your legs each night really can help (I buy vitamin K2 capsules and just break them open and rub the vitamin K2 oil inside into the areas where I have spider veins trying to surface).Wishing everyone happy, healthy skin. :) :)",1
"This is a pretty good little brush.  I wanted something a little stiffer... this one is softer on both ends than i thought it would be... but it is still totally useable for what i needed it for =eyebrows.  The brush side is good for filling in, the bristle side is good for sealing.  Not bad.",4
"I've been using this in translucent for years. I have acne prone oily skin. After a couple of hours in the Texas heat, my face looks wet. It doesn't make my face stay matte but it maintains a dewy, natural finish when I would otherwise look greasy. I just purchased this in Corrective Yellow for the first time because it's not sold in stores and I have to say that it is a lot more yellow than the picture depicts. It is a dark and bright yellow. The good news is that you can't tell that it's a dark, bright yellow when you apply it. My skin has yellow undertones and it's hard to find foundation shades that are yellow enough for me. This helps add the slightest bit of tinge that my skin needs for a natural looking finish.",4
"I got magnetic polishes at bargain price but didn't like the magnet from last year.This is new magnet 2013, all has strong magnetic power and design is great except for the stripes.",5

"It is just not what I thought as swatches online can be decieving. The product is great, the color is just way to neon, like toxic waste.",2
"The colors are nicely pigmented, they go on smoothly. The long lasting of it works better with an eye primer first. There is a large array of colors and can be easily mixed together and blended. I bought this for myself and my niece and am glad I did.",5

"I am so pleased to have this mirror.  It is very handy to have in a dressing room.  I like it for applying makeup, and my husband likes it to shave.  The expandable arm extends out to use, then retracts to the wall for storage.  The two sided mirror is easy to flip and tilt into position at a regular view turns for easy magnification at any height.Originally, we enjoyed this type of mirror when staying at a hotel, so we researched buying one  for our home.  Amazon offers this light at an excellent value at half the expense at any home improvement or bathroom accessory store.  Very easy to mount with a either a small power drill or hand screwdriver. My only concern is I wish the light were a little brighter. However, if the room has ample lighting, it reallyh isn't that much of an issue. This is a valuable addition to any bathroom.  Over all it is attractive and will compliment other chrome fixtures.  Fast shipping, well packed.  Two thumbs up!",5
"It's sooo inexpensive, feels great on your face, and you'll see results instantly.I use this mask 3 times a week and it really rejuvenates it! I don't generally have problem skin, but I just do it as a refresher and my boyfriend notices after I use it!One tube is actually huge and will last you a long time.",5
"I can not express how disappointed I am with the seller of this product. I didin't even get a chance to try it, it was DESTROYED when it arrived! It didn't even have a health safety seal(gross, someone could have put their hands in it!). I wish I had just gone to Wal-Mart, which I suggest anyone interested in this product should do. Now I have to wait 4 weeks for a refund!However, from looking at the bronzer before returning it, this is what I observed:Very shimmery, great if you like a lot of shimmer.I you have oily skin, this might make it look worse.But, like I said, I will never know for sure!",1
"PROS:-This lotion is lightweight but unlike many lightweight lotions, it wasn't watery.-It was pleasantly moisturizing and applied to the skin well.I personally like the botanical blend scent, although I know that scents are an individual thing.  It was a strong scent and -lingered for hours, but I liked that as well.CONS:-What I didn't like was the slightly sticky residue it left behind, even hours after application.  That is my main issue with this lotion, which is bothersome enough to me to not care for this lotion.",3
"Very emollient, and you only need a tiny dab, so it's economical.Why pay a fortune for fancy eye creams when this one, at least in my experience, does as good a job?",5

He would purchase this product again.,5
"The color is still a beautiful lilac which is very in right now, however it is not nearly as bright/vivid as I expected. It's more dull and darker. Oh well I'll still wear it. Fortunately it might be more work appropriate because it's more subtle than I anticipated.",3
Best drugstore concealer Ive tried so far.... After my Mac pro long wear concealer this is second...,4
This product does the job and helps heal my acne overnight. It does not clog my pores and it can be worn before putting on makeup and especially on some what broken skin from acne. Not only for older women.,5
"I read the product description and was sold.  I intended to like this polish, however, after using it I couldn't.Without a base coat the product was too transparent.  Even with a base coat, this polish lasted less than 12 hours before chipping.  It was horrible!  You spend the money to purchase it and take the time to apply but before I could return home I looked like good grooming didn't matter a wit to me.  They have nice colors but I will never buy or use this again.",2
"I use this cuticle oil several times a week, brushing it on my cuticles at night before bedtime.  It's helped soften my dry cuticles and keep them healthy.",5
"This product (assuming mine is the real deal, which given the texture, I think it is.  Got scared reading all those reviews about fake product, that is something to watch out for and kinda scary to hear about!) isn't the best of its type that I've tried before.  My hairdresser uses the same type of thing, but a different brand (I can't remember what it is now, I need to ask her) that works a lot better.  This does give some volume and helps style certain hairdos, but I really like the one my hair dresser uses better.  I was a little disappointed.  And yes, it makes your hair feel stiff but I expected that and you have to really scrub your scalp or wash your hair a couple times to know you've gotten it all out.  This isn't a good product for everyday use, just for certain occasions when you really want a lot of extra volume or are doing your hair in way where you can use the boost.  This product is okay but I have to spend a lot of time ratting my hair to get it to work.  There are products that seem to lift it up easier...  and work all day. I also noticed that while I can feel the texture of this in my hair all day, it doesn't hold the volume up all day.",3
"This kit comes with a battery (included) operated device that has a spinning peg.  It also has a brush head and a foam head, a tube of cleanser, and a tube of microdermabrasion paste.The labeling is not clear, and instructions are almost non-existent.  You're to attach the appropriate head to the unit, the brush for cleansing or the foam pad for abrading, then moisten your face, apply the appropriate product and have at it.  OK, well, how much product am I supposed to use?  The tubes are the same size, but you're supposed to, if you choose, use the cleanser daily, and the microdermabasion once a week.  So does that mean you use seven times as much of the microdermabrasion paste as cleanser?Actually, it didn't matter in the end.  I didn't like either ""tube"" product.  Each dried rapidly on my face, even though I splashed it good with water beforehand.  I always splash my face with water before I start any sort of cleansing.  I rinsed off the cleanser and applied my usual lightly foaming cleanser.That I liked.  The brush head has very soft bristles, and my skin was very clean and my skin felt fabulous.The foam head, for microdermabrasion, is very like a good, firm makeup sponge.  Since the product dried on my face, I tried it on knees, elbows and the backs of my hands.  There was a tiny bit of dead skin removal, which is appropriate.  However, the skin on my knees turned beet red for a while.It's fourth down, and Olay is going to have to punt.  My advice is skip this, and use a BHA, AHA, or PHA product to exfoliate.  This thing is just a waste of time.",2
"This curling iron got hot super fast, so there's no waiting to curl your hair.  There are temperature settings, so I opted with a medium heat.My long hair is stick straight and super fine, so sometimes it slips out of curling iron's grip, which can make it hard to style your hair.  This gripped my hair tightly without tugging and there was enough heated iron to wrap my hair around several times and hot enough to heat all the way through the multiple wraps of hair.My hair is hard to curl, so I was happy with the loose curls I got from this iron.  The width is nice at 1 1/4 inch and I didn't feel like it made my bangs too poofy and 80's looking.Warming pad was nice touch and fits nicely by the sink.  I like that it turns off on it's own - but not so quickly that you have to turn it back on while doing your hair.  And the cord doesn't get tangled - big bonus.",5
"This was my all time favorite sunscreen, and now that I am pregnant, I felt okay using it due to how few ingredients it had. My new bottle, sadly, has many, many more ingredients and is much more greasy. I will be returning it. Ugh. Now I have to find a new one. Anyone have suggestions?",1
This is a great palate.  I am so glad I bought this. It has so many great colors in it and comes with a little eye shadow base and liquid liner.  Great for traveling.,5
it clogs my pores and also makes me sensitive to the sun when I wake up the next morning it also made my face a shade darker than my body but since I stopped using it went back to normalI have been going the natural route so I will not be repurchasing any thing more from this brand,1
"I ordered this peel a couple months ago and did a peel every 10 days or so. I like how it brightended my skin and dried out some of my acne. I was hoping for some dramatic results with acne scarring and other hyperpigmentation issues. Just ordered the 20% peel, going to give it a try and may next time I will try a Glycolic 10 or 15% peel.",5
This product drys the nails really well so that the acrylic sticks better.  this product is honestly the only thing tat held my nails on when I was using some cheap and worthless primer.  It is an awesome product.  I would absolutely purchase again.,5
"Scent: Amazing and masculine. Sweet and spicy. Blend of tobacco leaves, pepper and leather with greens. Very classy. Age mid 20s+.Projection: 3 out of 5Longevity: 2 out of 5 (4 hours max)Bottle: Awesome. Classy dark glass wrapped in burberry cloth with a great cap that locks on tight. Spray shoots out a ton and you will need it.Application: Winter. Any time of day. Hard to be cloying so 2 on neck and 1 on each wrist. Great for Christmas or Thanksgiving.Similar fragrances: John Varvatos VintageOverall: I love this scent but I am disappointed in the longevity and the projection. If you buy this, I highly suggest the 3.4oz and making a decant so you can reapply after 4 hours. I personally wear John Varvatos Vintage more because I like it slightly better. It too has horrible longevity.",4
"I received Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap a couple of weeks ago and have been showering with it everyday since. According to the box this soap is for all skin types. However, it does advertise to be very helpful to people with psoriasis, eczema, and acne. My husband has been known to call my skin, miracle skin or perfect so I can unfortunately (or fortunately?) not tell you the results in change against any of these three skin problems. I can however still give you my point of view from a &#34;normal skinned&#34; girl.The bar can be used with a loofah (like I do) or it lathers up well on it's own also. I just prefer the loofah on a daily basis because I am a creature of habit.Don't worry about scent. It does not smell like mud! ;) I was actually very concerned that the soap would when I applied to review it, however, I can safely say that it merely has a fresh soap smell. I have read other reviews where some smelled like lemons from lemongrass, but I'm assuming they received a different bar than myself.Here are my thoughts:The scent is pleasant. My skin was left feeling clean, moisturized but not oily.Will I continue to use this product? Yes! I love that it has lasted me so long as opposed to my liquid soaps. I also love the fresh clean feeling I have after showering with this product. It feels great especially after a sweaty workout or run!I'm also a fan of the ingredients. This product is not packed full of crazy ingredients and chemicals. It is all natural! It is really good to know what I am putting on my skin.",5
"I love this Nioxin. My daughter who is a hair stylist in Beverly Hills told me to buy this for my thinning, breaking hair. It works so well I have told all my friends who are now using it too. My hair looks fab! Thank you so much.",5
"I like 'Beach Waves' vs the spiral curls that other wands produce. It is not tapered at the end. I've tried others and they don't give a smooth type of wave. It heats very quickly. The tip is long enough to hold thus reducing nasty burns. It's ceramic, this ensures my waves will last. Cleaning is easy. The metal stand keeps counter tops from getting burned. It has LED that shows the temp, which is adjustable to my hair type.It works as well or better than my stylist wand yet cost a quarter of the price. I purchased two. One to have at work to spruce up for a after work date, etc.Pros:Heats fast, 30 secsTimed shut offCeramic wandHot 400FTangle free cordHeat GloveGreat priceGreat for thick hairSwivel cordMetal standLED temp indicatorCons:Glove may give one a false sense of securityNo travel bagAll in all this is a great product for the price.",5
"This Total Care conditioner works well for my hair. I have straight, fine hair and using this conditioner daily keeps it healthy looking. It doesn't weigh my hair down and it makes my hair easy to brush. The conditioner is thick. It comes out like a paste, but it works into my hair with no trouble at all. It has a very pleasant and subtle floral scent which I like very much.What I like best, however, is the bottle. The opening is one of those see saw type things in which you press down on one side and the other with the opening pops up. It's easy to squeeze out the conditioner and it's just the right size so you don't squeeze out too much. This opening is at the bottom of the bottle, so as it sits in the shower, all the conditioner is moving down to be used. I'm sure there's less waste this way. And the bottom of the container is the biggest, so no worries about it tipping over because it's top-heavy. Overall, it's a convenient conditioner that works well for my hair.",4
"This is the most moisturizing conditioner I ever used. I have coarse 3C hair and it leaves my hair soft, manageable, and easy to detangle! Also, with its low price, I can use it liberally !!!!",5
"I normally use Sephora Waterproof makeup remover on a cotton ball to remove my eye make up.  I was very excited to try these because I was hoping to spend less and have something that would travel better than a bottle of liquid.First of all these DO remove eye-makeup - but not as easily as one would hope.  The pads are much drier than I would like and actually seem to require scrubbing, which is something I do NOT want to do around my eyes.  I am just hitting the age where fine lines are starting to make an appearance and I don't want to do anything to encourage them.If you are willing to scrub, then these will remove waterproof eye makeup.  But then so will any number of other products that don't require you to possibly damage the sensitive skin around your eyes by scrubbing.  If you have a teen who isn't taking her makeup off at all, then I would consider these - but anyone older than that I would invest in something else.",3
If you need a lot of eye brushes and don't mind a stand that slides all over this may be for you.  The brushes only have one piece of elastic in the center so the brushes go this way and that.  Don't buy just for the case.,3
"Do not underestimate the simple construction of the product! And it looks a little scary, but its the most gentle way to detangle hair! It works wonders on my kinky curly hair! Where has this thing been all my life?",5
"I have been searching for something to help my fine hair have some type of style.  I love this product, it helps my fine straight limp hair. It defines curls, adds shine and makes my hair bouncy.  I hope that they do not change this product.It is the best for what I need, I have very fine hair which curls when I use this product.",5
"I don't use a lot of Blues and Greens even though they would look good on me because I look good in blue and green, But the color does look really nice. It Looks blue with purple micro glitters.",5
I love the size of the curls but the barrel pinches my hair every time I use it.  I have long hair and its hard to avoid getting hair near the part you press with your thumb.  I have bought this in the past and didn't have this problem so maybe its just a bad one.  I did like that they ship it with an extra hinge so you don't toss it when it breaks.,1
"i LOVE this scent. my bf loves it on me, it's a cologne, good to wear at night, very sexy... makes you feel sexy. i love it. it's expensive but it's for a reason, the quality is great and the bottle is gorgeous, and the smell is just delicious... so worth the price and the bottle will last you forever.",5
"This is a must for anybody who has a little girl with long hair and you have to argue about brushing it. Also great for big girls with fine hair that tangles easy, like me. The only reason for  4 instead of 5 stars? The little ball-tip thingies tend to fall off and it will have to be replaced. I just wish I knew about this when my kids were little, or when I was little!!!",4
"For some reason Amazon only has a handful of detangler comb/brush choices so I decided to go ahead and order this one because it seemed to be the best choice at the time.When I was younger I remember having several &#34;detangler&#34; combs in our bathroom drawer because my younger sister and I have always had very long straight hair that tangled up, especially after bath time so instead of my mom having to chase us around to brush our hair and then we would scream like someone is trying to kill us she always used a brush and detangler combination and it worked fine!I don't remember what age I was when my hair seemed as though it stopped getting tangled all the time but for a long time I remember not having that issue and life was GREAT.About a year ago though my hair started to frizz-up and tangle and all sorts of other weird stuff so my search started with hair treatment products, new shampoos, etc. While I was trying to figure out what was going on I decided I would also buy new brushes and unbelievably so after so many years find a detangler brush as well....:(For starters the detangler combs we had when I was young were tiny compared to this cumbersome thing, they were made out of different resin/plastic and the bristles were also completely different.None the less I still decided to give it a try because as all things in life you can no longer get all the awesome things we all grew up with and miss dearly almost on a daily basis!My two sense about this comb is that because its gigantic, the bristles are way too thick, the material used to make it is very cheap, and the alignment of the bristles is way off because they are so big instead of it actually detangling your hair it in fact tangles it even more than when you first started.The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because I like the design and tortoise pattern.I would never buy this again or recommend it!PS: If you want an INCREDIBLE detangler and brush invest in one of: The Wet Brush and you won't regret it! For those interested after using the brush for several months I finally reviewed it on 11/25/2012 its the black J&D; Beauty B830W.",2
"I will start off saying that I do prefer the more expensive conditioners like Tresseme or Pantene to Suave.  HOWEVER, the price on those sometimes is a little off putting, especially because I have long hair and I tend to use more conditioner than the average person.  I'll buy a bottle of the pricey stuff every now and again to treat myself but for every day conditioner the price Suave makes it a good alternative to save money and still get pretty decent quality.  It's definitely better than most of the more inexpensive brands, and I'd think if you have short hair you probably would not notice a difference between expensive brands and suave at the end of your shower when all is said and done.  I could be wrong - I am just making a guess on that since short hair is less prone to tangle.Conditioner arrived with the lid taped closed with clear packing tape to avoid spillage and that worked well.  In the past I have received conditioner that did not have that done, and there sometimes was leakage.",5
Wonderful face wash. We have used it for years.  The tea tree oil makes it both refreshing and extremely effective.,4
These are so pretty! The only problem is deciding which design I want to do on my nails now... SO MANY CHOICES!!,5
"I wasn't sure I'd like this color, but I figured I'd try something new anyways.  The color is a bit darker than what the photo shows, but I still really love it.  It's an excellent color for any season!  The application is thinner than other Essie polishes I have, and requires 3 coats for maximum opacity. I love this polish with silver glitter gradients or just by itself!",4
"I love the other Olay products, so I got this one as a gift to give to my mother.  I assume this will be as good as the other products, but I'll see!",5
"I have been using a bottle of Method Foaming Hand Wash in the Lemon Mint variety and have been very frustrated because the pump was so difficult to depress.  After struggling with the pump for a couple weeks and it's not really getting any better.  It's critical to fully release the spout to allow the wash to be expelled with ease, but the pump gets stuck in a lower position.  Once the apparatus is in the correct pumping position, the dispenser works okay and the very lemony and foamy wash does what it's intended to do, clean the hands.  If you do not care for a strong and lasting scent, skip this product.  It has been successful in eliminating stinky smells from my hands, to the likes of sardines and garlic.  It's also good to use on peppered hands after slicing hot peppers.  For placement near the kitchen sink, the dispenser is perfect with its shapely form, more slender and taller than most -- if only it would pump.  I think the way to go if you like the product is to order the refill package and use another operational dispenser.",3
"This product is just ""pretty good"". I would agree with a previous review that without powder this product can look very greasy ( I believe the previous review used the term ""like vaseline"")when used as an under eye concealer. Instead, I like to use it has a spot concealer on red blemishes or on the small broken capillaries around my nose-the yellow tone aids in covering these red areas. Final thoughts-I purchased this for a steal ($10 including shipping),especially considering the Benefit brand is fairly reputable, but most likely will not buy again.",4
"I did not have high hopes for this product as these creams rarely work.  I also was skeptical of the fact that price was cut down so low.  However, I must say that it did work a little bit.  I tried it every day for a week and could see a little bit of change so that my skin was more smooth.  I applied the product from knees to waist.  I saw the most change on my thighs.  I would recommend this product for people that are okay with a little change (something is better than nothing for $20), or maybe have a special event planned for which they want to look better like a reunion or vacation, or some place you are going to show off more of your body like the beach.",4
dont like the smell has a strong musk odor.. yuck if that what they mean by smell like a man.. then keep it.. other than that delievery was on time as projected.. but dont like the smell i wouldnt advise it unless your a fan of musk.. winters coming how about some deer musk,1
"Gives amazing curls , packing was ok nothing great and product reached safely. Argan oil given is very very less :(",4
Beautiful! Came pre curled and has about five to six clips. It is a large clip in. It is perfect for me!,5
"I don't know if something was different with my jar, but I just never clicked with the smell. I found it unpleasant. Could just be my body chemistry. I did like the texture and moisturizing ability of the lotion...worked great on my dry skin, but I could've smelled better.",3
"I use a lot of various oils for bath and body products, but I had never used rosehip oil and was quite impressed with the texture that it left on my hands. You know how some oils can leave an odd almost uncomfortable texture on your hands sort of gritty but also like you didn't moisturize at all? This is not like that, it leaves a nice comfortable texture. This is also very nice for moisturizing your face, I didn't have any breakouts from it and I was not greasy from it. I use one or two drops (depending on how dry my face is) before bed and when I wake up in the morning my face feels nice. Before I used the rosehip oil I would just put a bit of lotion on before bed and I would wake up with my face feeling icky and a bit greasy.The smell is earthy and nutty, but not overwhelming; it's scent is much like jojoba oil and I do not notice the scent linger on my skin. I love using rosehip oil in my bath bombs, it makes the water feel lovely and I get a great overall moisturizing from the bath water (just be careful the tub may be slippery if you use in the bath). When I get out of the bath my skin doesn't feel dry and itchy like it normally would even if I have shaved my legs (which are highly uncomfortable when it's just plain water). If you decide to add to bath water, wait until there is a decent amount of water in the tub to avoid extra oil on the tub floor.Make sure to follow the manufacturers instructions for use.Disclosure: I received this product for free to try and review.",5
This stuff made my hair tangled and dry looking. I wasn't really impressed with it. But the sellers definitely sent this right away and I was happy about the delivery.,2
Does what it says. You can use these on the go for deep removal of oil and dirt. Very simple. It works.,5
"I've had dry skin all my life and have used many different facial moisturizers, but the aging process took it's toll on my skin and made my skin drier to the point of uncomfortable.  I needed something that was safe for my face and that would work with my daily moisturizer.  After research, I found this product.  When it arrived, I used it right away.  It did the trick.  It is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  I apply and rub a little over my entire face and neck area, then put my daily moisturizer over it.  I do this twice daily, in the morning and right before going to bed.  My skin is softer, it is moist and here's what's priceless; my skin feels a lot more comfortable. Perhaps for others, this product alone may be sufficient, but I need both; Squalane and my moisturizer.",5
"I have been using the suite of Perfective Ceuticals products for 2 months. Though I noted in my reviews of the serum and eye cream that I had not seen any diminishment in the appearance of wrinkles or lines during these 2 months, I do feel that the moisturizing cream is quite effective. I have very dry skin and have always used a moisturizer twice daily. The Perfective Ceuticals cream is so effective that I really just need to use a few dabs to moisturize my entire face and neck. The container is still about half full, so I expect to get at least 2 more months use out of it. It goes on smoothly and leaves so greasy residue. It is a bit sticky at first, but I usually wait a few minutes before applying my makeup. My skin is soft and supple, though I don't believe I look any younger :)The cobalt blue packaging is quite striking, and I leave the blue sphere out on my bathroom counter since it is so attractive.I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.",5
"I've been a flat iron user for several years now. People have raved about this HSI Iron, so I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by my results. One of my biggest pluses is that my hair is very shiny, even at the end of the day. Since I started using this flat iron I can go 4 days without washing and blow drying my hair.  I have had compliments and would suggest this flat iron to anyone who wants fabulous hair.",5
"I wear a size 9 shoe and when I first received these heel socks I thought they would be very uncomfortable but actually they fit my feet quite well at least before washing.  They do provide moisturizing for dried, cracked heels and in my case even some degree of comfort from the pain of plantar fasciitus.  However I don't think I would buy these as using some good moisturizing cream with tight fitting regular socks works just as well.  I was given this item as a sample to review from the manufacturer.",3
I got this as a present for a friend who had never used a make-up brush before and wanted to start.  It's a great starter set and the price was extremely reasonable.,5
I have been having trouble locating this product locally - so have been ordering it on-line.  The color is perfect if you're already a lighter shade of brunette - or if you're a redhead like me.  The nice thing is - even if you use it all the time - and pull you hair through the cap - it covers what you've already done without it going that ghostly white that some of the others frosting shades do.  Highly recommended.,5
"I have used the Nivea for Men Sensitive body wash for quite some time but recently decided to try the Cool version. My verdict: This is absolutely perfect for a men's body wash -- and when I say ""men,"" I mean first and foremost this is not for guys who are looking for those canned Axe or Old Spice scents. The smell of this body wash is very close in my opinion to Calvin Klein's Eternity for Him cologne, which is to say that it has a mature and very unique scent to it.It's very moisturizing and washes off clean for me. I cannot detect the ""cooling"" effect of this body wash at all, but it's still worthy of five stars from me for being one of the best on the shelf right now.",5
This brush was better than expected.  The handle is very sturdy and the bristles are soft.  Was able to reach hard places with the long handle.  Like the loop on the handle so I can hang in the shower to dry.,5
"If you have more sensitive skin, 30% or less is the way to go.  Skin Obsession acid peel works great, and yes, you will feel the burn!  I think I will try 40% after this bottle is gone.  Remember, no more than once every 3 weeks!  And I learned the hard way -- don't get it on your neck (I got horrible temporary, itchy welts).  But for the face it's great.",5
copperglow berry is pretty much all berry and no copper. I wanted a copper color but this is almost purple. It does go on nicely and feels good but I don't know how long it wears since I just got it and applied it.,3
"This product is a very good solution for those who find that they breakout after using a sunscreen. Cetaphil has formulated this sunscreen to be non-comedongenic (won't clog pores), fragrance-free, and oil free and yet provide moisturization and SPF 30 protection from the sun.Developed by a dermatologist, the active sunscreen ingredients include:Avobenzone 3%Octisalate 5%Octocrylene 7%The lightweight liquid goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin leaving a slightly matte finish.This product is intended to be used for normal, everyday use and not for exercise or swimming as it is not water resistant.",4

"this is my first bottle ever of a tingle,... i've used packets but this is my first bottle.it's not hot enough and the color i got from it was very minimal... i'd rather just use a bronzer over this.small ato but nothing gross..the smell is like a vanilla.  it's rich and creamy.  if you're looking for a starting-out tingle, this is a good idea.  however, if you're experienced with tingles this is not a good idea.",4
"I have been applying henna to my hair now for 2 years. It's messy, it's time consuming and it's worth it. This color, deep red, has everything I was looking for in a henna. My recipe is deep/dark red, mixed with one egg, 2 tsp of coconut oil and a splash of lemon. I steep hibiscus tea and use that as the water. If you can stand it, leave in for 6 plus hours.",5
"My natural color is ash blonde.  I usually dye it a medium/dark brown.  I decided to try this for a bit of an auburn tint with some highlights.  It was light/medium brown when I started and a ridiculous shade of bright red when I was done.  I immediately put some dark brown over it and then an ashe blonde to try to cover some of the red.  I was able to tone it down, but it is still WAY too red for my taste.  Without stripping/bleaching it and starting over, I'm going to be stuck with this red for a long time.  If your hair absorbs red like mine, DON'T use this color!  I'm not crazy about this brand in general.  I like John Frieda and Nice N Easy foam colors.",1
"I've purchased a number of curling irons over the years, at various prices. The Conair Satin Finish 1-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron is a tremendous bargain. The ceramic finish allows me to put some strategic curl in my hair after blowing dry, without having my hair be damaged by sticking to the surface and overheating. The clamp holds securely enough to work on thin sections without slipping.This iron offers great convenience of use, safety features, and even imparts a wonderful shine to your hair. You can pay more for an iron, but it will be hard to match all these features at this great price, and I will definitely buy a second one in a different size.",5
"Well, it's not a horrid in general, but the drydown of sickly-sweet caramel is horrible on my skin. I love the fruity topnotes. The rest of the perfume... no thanks.",2
"Don't get me wrong, I really like this conditioner and I am not constantly wanting to rip my hair out due to the itchiness that I used to have. The only problem is that I feel that in the winter, my hair is a bit dry.  I use more conditioner, my hair is heavier, I use the right amount, it is almost right, better than any other product I have used, but not perfect.  That is the reason for the 4 stars.  In short, however, this is great stuff, the price is right, you won't feel greasy in 24 hours, and your hair isn't falling out.  Since I was previously desperate, this was a life savor to me.  Try it out and review it if you are more picky than I am.",4
Got it way before estimated time  this product is what I needed will tell  you all later how it's been doing. my face is quite red allot of the time.Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red. Good price too.,5
"I love Pacifica solid perfumes! Currently, on their website, they sell approximately 24 solid perfumes. I have Tahitian Gardenia, Mexican Cocoa, Hawaiian Ruby Guava, Malibu Lemon, Tuscan Blood Orange, Waikiki Pikake, Thai Lemongrass, Tibetan Mountain Temple, and Lotus Garden. My favorites are: Waikiki Pikake, Thai Lemongrass, Tibetan Mountain Temple, and Lotus Garden. I was first introduced to Pacifica solid perfumes when I looked at their display at a Whole Foods store in early 2010. Ever since I bought my first Pacifica solid perfume, I've become their fan! I love the solid perfume concept because you can put these solid perfumes in your purse or in your desk drawer - they're so portable! Last year, I gave these Pacifica solid perfumes as part of gifts to my friends and co-workers. They make great Christmas stocking stuffers! I also love the fact that the fragrances are light and not overpowering or overwhelming. I'm not a fan of heavy fragrances. I also love the fact that I have control in terms of how much fragrance I put on my body. Sometimes when you use perfume sprays, you can accidentally spray too much. I also don't have to worry about broken glass perfume bottles and flammable perfume sprays. With solid perfumes, all I have to do is apply whatever amount I want on my wrists. And yes, the Pacifica fragrance does wear off during the day, but I can reapply again since I'm carrying the solid perfume in my purse. When it comes to fragrance, it's better to wear less than to wear too much! I also love that the Pacifica company is cruelty-free and 100% vegan - no animal testing. Pacifica uses 100% natural coconut and soy wax in their products. I love that I can try a variety of scents at such an affordable price. Pacifica's solid perfume line makes life easier for women!",5
creamy and lasts all day!,4
"this stuff is fantastic. i've got thin flat hair that, unfortunately, i also like to keep long. i also hate the feel of sticky hair products and feel like in the end my hair usually still falls and then just looks dirty from the product.  not with this product.  it is very lightweight, some have said this is a bad thing but i think its great.  no stickiness, your hair is still light and flowy, but when used right all the sudden you have a ton more volume at the roots.  the key for me has been DON'T USE TOO MUCH, or it will not work and your roots will look almost greasy.  i use just 1-2 pumps tops and rub it directly into my roots only.  blow dry upside down and voila, apparently natural healthy volume (for a little natural looking hold too, follow it up with rusk weightless hairspray).  i will say it does have a bit of an intense herb-y smell to it, but doesn't stick to your hair.",5
"I have ordered several brands of argan oil from Amazon, I ened up getting Watts Beauty ArganGoldTM 1oz/100% Certified Organic Cold Pressed Argan as a free product with the purchase of another Watts Beauty Product and fell in love from the 1st drop. It sinks immediately into your skin without a trace of sheen afterward. I have used Elma&Sana for my last 2 argan oil purchases and thought that was the highest quality for absorption ..then i got this one.. I will never have to purchase another brand again.. I found the one for me!!! I got cystic acne a few years back after turning 32 and course after course of antibiotics didnt treat it, so I researched the benefits you can get from using argan oil ..which was baffling to me because we have all been told to never put products with oil on our faces when we have oily or combo skin .. well I put that old wives tale to bed when I went for it, the argan oil started to clear my skin, improve the texture and also have made constant new outbreaks a thing of the past. i use argan oil after washing my face, applying hyluronic acid ( makes the oil absorb more deeply ) and I finish in the daytime with a sunscreen. With other brands I found I couldnt use both in the morning and night due to it being too heavy for daytime use, but with Watts I am able to apply in the morning as well. Hope this helps. Also Direct 2U Wholesale is an amazing seller.",5
"This is a gorgeous color that you can wear throughout the year if you choose. I have olive/tannish skin and this color looks amazing, I get compliments all the time!",5
I like the product. It is indeed refreshing every time I use it. I will be happy to order again,4
I have been using this product for years and continue to use it when my hair needs it.I also rub it on my dog's coat !,5
"I went to Sephora asking for some samples of sweat-proof foundation. When I posted on thie message board, a user recommended this. I tend not to like BB Creams very well, because they give almost no coverage. But I was willing to give a try. So I got a sample of this from Sephora.I really don't like this BB cream. There are a few reasons why. First, this comes in only one shade. It claims to be for every skintone. But I don't think it really is. The cream itself is almost a greyish color. When I first applied it, it looked AWFUL. It basically made me look like I was dead. Given a little time, it did adjust somewhat to my skin, but I've had much better color matches with other foundations.2nd, I would describe this as sheer to light coverage. It is definitely NOT medium coverage. Due to a genetic disease, I have a lot of redness and small bumps on my face. They make me self-conscious, so I like to cover them up. But I don't want to look like I'm wearing a ton of makeup. Even after applying two layers, you could still clearly see the redness under the makeup. Even then, it looked thick and cakey.I also think that this is way overpriced. In my opinion, it's not even mediocre.If you are someone who needs very little coverage, I would recommend this BB cream. But if you have anything you want to hide, this simply won't do the trick. You are better off looking elsewhere. I will probably end up throwing away the sample, and will not purchase a full-sized bottle.",2
"I like these lashes because they are not ""over-the-top"" looking! They look very natural to your eye-lash.  I don't like the ""Lamb-Chop's"" looking lashes. You remember the puppet cow or whatever animal the lady use to talk to on the kid friendly channel?! I just think makeup should compliment you, not emabarrass you. Anyway, these lashes are very nice, if you do not want the clown look. Sorry, no offense to anyone....",5
"I got this color in a kit. Didn't think it would be a chart topper for me, I typically go for a deeper burgundyish red. But as it turns out I gave it a try and it looks fantastic on my pale skin. I think it will work well in any season. Classy.Applies super easily. I've used it twice now. Performs as promised.",5
This stuff is amazingly moisturizing. I use it on my face and my hands during the cold winter months here in New England. It is very thick and creamy and a little goes a long way. This tin last the whole winter.,5
I was worried about the color being right for my skin. The color ended up being perfect and the coverage was nice. My only gripe is that with dry skin it really accentuated that. Next time I will try using a primer.,3
"perfect sticks, perfectly shaped and smooth, i love rosewood sticks as they push easier on my cuticles and these are priced appropriately, compared to sally's at 5 sticks for 4 bucks. will def buy again when finished",5
"These foils are thin and come in a usable variety of colors.  We use them as stripes as well as removable guides.  The price is low enough that you can experiment and not be upset if you waste them.  They apply easy, stick well and remove just as easy",5
"Price is great, product is great. I noticed my forehead lines, eyebrow expression lines and other fine lines diminish after using it just a short time. I want to order this again! I would recommend this, it is great under a moisturizer, but dont use too much or it leaves a thin film and rolls off face when moisturizer is applied.",5
"A must have!!! I cant't imagine how I survived removing my make up with out this products all these years. My skin is VERY oily, ridiculous. I get black and white heads no matter what expensive make up products I use. I even own a clarisonic mia brush and this product is so great, you don't even need the brush. It's magic. I have had only 2 pimples ever since I started using it, and I use to break out every week, because my pores were clogged. Not anymore!!! Not with this wonderful DHC Deep Cleansing Oil miracle product. I tried the Oil Cleansing Method a couple of years ago, you basically use jojoba oil and castor oil to remove the dirt and impurities from your face and that did not work for me at all. So, if you had a bad experience with other oils like I did, trust me on this one, it will not disappoint you.",5
I love the way this toner smells as it has a light rose scent to it. I use it to clean my face after running and before bed. It feels so fresh on my face and does a great job of taking the dirt off my face. I once used it after washing my face with a cotton ball and was amazed there was still dirt on my face as the cotton ball had dirt on it.,5
"Axe Harmony Shower Gel is a typical Axe product. I wouldn't say it will make the ladies swoon over men who use it, but you might get a sniff or two, followed by a smile. You'll smell good. This piney scent is yum and fresh. The product suds up nicely and gets you all clean and smelling like a Pine Forest. You might attract a wood nymph. Which might be kind of hot, because I read this book with a wood nymph and it was hot.Wood as in tree. Not the other kind of wood. Minds out of gutters people.Also, this stuff is not going to dry out all your boy parts. Some soaps have some nasty additives and alcohol, so you feel you have to lotion up after you get out the shower. This isn't that bad. I suggest you still lotion up, because water does pull out moisture from your skin. (So bizarre haven't figured out that science yet, but I'm kind of slow) And boys with dry skin are kind of gross. You can't use the man-card and say &#34;I'm a man, they don't make lotion for me.&#34; Because now with brands like Axe, they do make lotions for you! So, use lotion.I know they also make these things as shampoos and body washes. Um, that's great and all - but use a shampoo and boxy wash separately. Yes, I know - they are both soap, but a boy can have shiny pretty, flake free hair, just like a girl. So use a nice shampoo. And you don't want your hair smelling like your chest. So a girl can sniff you chest and go &#34;oh that is nice, I'm in the forest.&#34; And then sniff your hair and go &#34;ooh now I'm ... &#34; well whatever scent you use for your hair.So, wash up boys.",5
"My favorite sunscreen for my face.  High SPF, slides on and sinks in without whiteness.  Also rated very safe!  This is a keeper, I'm on my 3rd tube!",5
"This is a very pretty color, I love it. Looks great with a single coat of the Bronzed color over it, or by itself. Went on opaque with only two coats, and looks terrific.",5
I was hesitant to buy this product but I have no regrets.  This eyeliner does a really nice job and gives me the black lining I am looking for.,5
"I have been looking for a shampoo for my little Ozzy for some time now...and did some searching in local stores and didn't see anything that I liked. So I turned to my trusty friend, Amazon, and poof!!! There was this product!! I waited anxiously by the mailbox for this to arrive. First thing I did was open the bottle and smell this product....WOW!! :) Secondly I got Ozzy in the tub and scrubbed him up and I am honestly in love with this product!! He smells amazing, his coat is shiny and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone!! (Thank you to every one for posting the reviews, YOU are the sellers of this product!! and I thank you!!)",5
"I've been looking for a shampoo that will give some volume and lift to my hair.  As I have become totally grey, I have also noticed my hair thinning.  I saw a commercial for this shampoo and decided to try it.  I immediately noticed my hair feeling more full after the first wash.  My hair is chin length with some layers, and it definitely added some lift.  I have not been using conditioner but find that my hair is still soft and not tangled.  I plan to try out their conditioner as well.",4
"Love these! I rinse them off sometimes. Love the different sizes, for purse,drawer, etc. Just don't DROP them!!!  lol",5
"I have used this shampoo for almost a year and still love it. I have really curly, oily hair and am allergic to almost everything, but this works just fine for me. I can only find smaller bottles at the store, so this larger size is an excellent deal. The only issue is that when I do occasionally use products with silicone or harder to break up substances I have to clarify with a shampoo full of sulphates to get everything out of my hair again.",5
"I have been using this for a few weeks now, it has not made my nails any stronger at all, it has not helped my cuticals any at all, and I cant tell any difference really, well I may not have as many chips, but my nails are still really weak and break super easy, and I have not grown them out any at all, sill extremely short (nail line or below nail line short), and I used as directed, applied 2 times a day everyday... at first I applied over a polish I had on, since it said it was fine to use over polish, it is NOT, because 2 days later all my polish was coming off, like all at once, in one big piece each nail, so don't use over polish. next I took off the polish, filed and shaped my nails and cleaned them, left completely polish free, and used this for over 3 weeks, and nothing, so I give up, I have used over half the bottle, and no improvement really, mabey a little bit, like I said, not as many chips, but that's about it, but its just not worth it, not the price,ordering, or the trouble of using, and not painting my nails for something that doesn't really work!",1
It look pertty but too big for nails ! If I know it that big I never order it . And some color only have four inside. :((,1
Love love love this product. My eyelashes had fallen out due to a thyroid condition and within a month of using this product they have grown back and are longer than before. Would highly recommend this product.,5
"I picked this product up because I live in Florida and can be found on most days off by the pool.  I personally find it taxing to apply sunscreen of the lotion variety because of the mess and time that it takes (especially for re-application).I love the spray bottle sunscreen, it takes only a minute to apply all over and protected my skin from the sun.  This product has a unique smell to it (a bit of coconut, makes you smell like the beach).  I liked the smell so it was a bonus for me.As far as protection is concerned I was very happy with the product.  It protected my skin for several hours in the direct sunlight so that the next day I had no red spots or any irritation at all.The product is waterproof as well.  I went into the pool a couple of times and did not feel like the product washed off in any way.  it was effective even after swimming.  The best part of the product for me is that it goes on so fast and conveniently.  It saves so much time and I find myself being willing to apply sunblock because of the spray technology.",5
"I had this product for about six months and frankly I wasn't impressed.  It didn't define my twist outs or braid outs compared to Roots of Nature coil creme, I didn't see any sheen and frankly it left my hair kind of dull and waxy feeling.  Which is odd because the ingredients looks promising.  I have type four and it is quite porous.  I passed it on to a young lady who is transitioning.",1
"ok I guess. They do not stay on too long and do transfer to cups or bottles when you drink  - pretty fast. A lot of choices though. I got the chance to try a few different colors and see if I should invest in another better brand similar color.  i would not buy this again, but had fun with it. You will notice that after a while - all colors kinda ...blend...I am not sure how to explain that, but they all look the same on my lips...yes i do clean my lipstick brush!",3
This perfume is a must have for women who want a casual but professional scent. It is very nice and the price isn't too bad.,5
"I do not like pre-moistened cloths as much as I like these.  These are easy to use, wet/wash/rinse, have some exfoliation benefits because of the textured cloth, and can be used besides just on your face or to remove makeup.  They are not &#34;baby-wipes&#34;; and I take them when I travel because they easily remove mascara, etc. so that I don't leave dark smudges on washcloths.  Another thing I like is that they don't burn your eyes like some of the pre-moistened ones do.",5
"Love this face cleanser, especially in the morning. It smells fresh and awakens my skin. Feels good going on. Great value too.",5
Very efficient in moisturizing.  You're gonna feel like all the fluids absorbed into the pores instantly and the face skin more dry than before it was applied.  But that's quite the normal reaction the skin to the acid serum should be.  So the skin overall will feel much more smoothed after several days of use.,4
"These are a nice set.  They are just the right size, not to long or short.  The colors are pretty and each comes in it's own plastic sheath to protect the file. I'm very please with the product.",5
"This is a great value item. The bubbles last, it smells pleasant, and it's big enough to last awhile for my extra bubbly baths.",5
"I got this for my hubby, he loves it and I do too. For the price, this will definitely be a staple of his.",5
It works great for blending in the make up I apply my make up with a brush and blend with this sponge. I get a perfect finish.,5
"Didn't do what I thought would. It smelled really nice. I thought this would really help with some of the cellulite on my thighs, but I not.",3
I don't think the Gelish lasts as long as the OPI in my opinion so I switched and I will not be buying any more Gelish brand gels.,1
"Great product i use it in my T zone because i tend to be oily there a little goes a lone way,the tube is small for the prize.",5
This is the best mascara I have ever tried. I used many brands but nothing compares to this one. My lashes are medium curled and thick. But I still love using mascara and this makes my lashes from medium to completely curled lashes. I don't even bother using a curler now!,5
"It seems to work well for my relaxed hair, but I've only used it once which was last night and my hair feels great this morning. I love the smell, and don't think it's too strong at all. Hopefully this will end my never ending search for a daily moisturizer for my super dry hair.The main reason for this review though, is that I got this product at Walgreens for $9.99. I have no idea why it's about 3x as much on Amazon! Just an FYI...",4
"i've been getting into nail art recently. first attempting to do my own and create different designs...but as usual my left hand would look lovely and the right one was a mess.i decided on the stamping kit and i'm completely happy with mu purchase. there's no big deal about it, it's just a two-sided rubber stamp and a metal scrapper.the polish gets picked up pretty great and if the scrapper ever rusts or gets lost you can always use a credit card or something similar to scrape the polish.i'm very happy with this.",5
I ordered these on February 27 and was to receive them on march 25 or later... I got these today with stamper and scraper on March 18... I'm so loving these.... I ordered from another company and their plates are cheap... But these are great!!! I was just playing around and they are great!!! I will be ordering more soon,5
"I used to look at beauty gurus on Youtube who used this product and think, &#34;This product seems overpriced and all it is is a topcoat&#34; however after borrowing it from a friend it is the only one i use!  No other topcoat has really worked for me like this one has.",5
This stuff does work. I dont use step one or step three. I just clean my face very well in the shower then use this. Also sounds crazy but after using this I also use alcohol. It doesnt dry out my face surprisingly and my face is very clear.,5
"Oh this product is great! I have always used &#34;department store&#34; cosmetics since I have very sensitive skin and have to be-careful. On a recommendation, I tried this product (for the price, why not!) and I love it! I say it works just as well if not better than some higher end eye primers. I didn't have any reaction at all to it. I really liked the applicator since I prefer not to use my fingers to put it on. I lasted all day and night, didn't alter the color of my eye shadows, and was very easy to get off. The only things I noticed was it took longer to dry than some of my other primers so I had to get used to that. I recommend it!",5
Travel size. Real eye cream. Good amount for the price. I might not buy the full size. Just glad I got this one. Fast shipping.,5
Great for the natural look. Looks clean and fresh. Perfect for shorter nails or just to put on top of natural nails.,5
This is my most favorite thing and my holy grail of my hair journey. I use my steamer 3-5 times a week for 30 minutes at a time. It moisturizes my hair in the most amazing way. I use it to deep condition and after I hair oil/pre poo. My hair shedding and breakage have reduced drastically and my curls are more defined. The steamer itself is sturdy and the water gets super hot. It has a timer and is pretty quiet. It uses distilled water only which is great because my tap water is too hard. The water does drip a little but that doesn't bother me. I love it and if it broke today I would go and buy the exact same one. I have type 4A thick hair.,5
I use it with my moisturizer on my face and with my body lotion.  It's a wonderful addition to my arsenal to hold back time.,5
"It actually takes a while to come in, but its handmade so you can definitly brag about that. I just dont like how the glue kinda peeks out of the seems. Other than that its very cute.",4
"For starters, I live on a beach and it doesn't get that cold here. Snows every other year or so in April (thanks to global warming) and school closes automatically if it gets colder than 40 or so degrees, snow or not (just to shows how ridiculously they treat cold weather here). I ventured out for a winter lotion for this harsh cold weather, or &#34;arctic blast&#34; as they're calling it.This is my first Vaseline lotion. I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent. It is a light scent that isn't harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all. The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I'm glad I did. The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily. I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold. It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn't grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet. It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands. Half a pump is enough for my hands.Hours later after going outside briefly and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth! I'm very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well. I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn't in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers. I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can. I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces. I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69",5
I like this mask a lot because it smells yummy! And it works well to clean the pores. I would for sure get this again.,4
I'm In love with this palette. The colors are beautiful and very pigmented. It came in perfect condition and before the delivery date. I plan on using this on my vacation. Happily grateful!,5
"This is meant for little girls I think.  It barely fits my 9 year old daughter, and it definitely does not fit me.  Very pretty though.",3
"Doesn't heat up enough.  I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.I did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped.",2
I love using amazon for recieving  a simple little product like: getting a shampoo in the mail! I like the herbal essence line of haircare. Its not breaking a budget and the product line is decent. This makes my hair feel good and Ive got no issues w it.,5
"I usually apply Peter Thomas Roth pm retinol but have been using this and I love it. It smells like something in the Aveda product line (woodsy/natural) and it feels so nice to apply - the directions suggest using wet fingertips but I apply a hydrating toner prior to application. Love, love, love Yalmeh.",5
"There are no tricks being had here. Besides the slooooooow shipping this product is exactly as described. As others mentioned it is small and panty hose like but for $1-$2 what do you expect? These will slip and I will never use them, but the seller has been kind enough to work with me on my issues and I am not upset with this purchase at all. Thank you.",3
"Pro: Whitens and brightens my natural nail tips. Looks really nice by itself.Con: Bright nail tips really show through color polish and look horrible. HORRIBLE.Pro: Quite a good basecoat -- keeps polish firmly in place and makes nails strong while in use.Con: It really doesn't fill in ridges very well. It does make nails somewhat smoother but nothing to write home about.Additionally, my bottle is gloopy and it tends to pool on the sides, making my polish colors uneven. Yeah, I'm not really impressed with OPI Ridge Filler. I'm going to stick with my Nail Envy.",3
"love it, love it. I buy all the time. great with dark hair. give pretty highlights.i will keep buying it.",5
"I know it looks long in the picture, but once you put it on, BOY IS IT LONG.  The bangs on mine were all crooked, and the wig tangles a lot.  Not as cute as in the picture here on Amazon, but it can be worked with. I got this for photoshoots, to change up my looks, and it photographed really well, so thats a plus.  But in the summer sun, its obviously fake because it shines like tinsel.  Its a fun wig to have though, so I decided to keep it.",3
This is a great product dries within minuets! doesn't dull over time doesn't chip. The only issue I have with it is that over a span of a month...  and I go thru So many bottles as I change my nail art every day . when you get to Half the bottle it starts to get stickey tacky.EVERY bottlehas done this. I have ordered NSI air shield to try. My nail girl swears by NSI air shield.NSI Airshield Polish Sealant .5 oz.,4
"After shampooing for awhile now with the companion AgeDefy shampoo from Pantene, I started using this conditioner.Truthfully, the shampoo has worked so well at keeping my hair soft and moisturized, I wasn't sure I really needed a conditioner at all. Still, I tried it.The results have been impressive!1) the consistency and fragrance of the conditioner are pleasant, and it rinses out cleanly.2) a little goes a long way. (My hair is short, and a quarter-sized dollop was too much, so I used slightly less than that the next time.)3) after drying my hair, it was noticeably smoother, felt silky, and had a great shine.4) after using it for about four days now, I haven't noticed any buildup, nor any ""weighed-down"" effect.One last note,  about ingredients:  It contains sulfates, and a bunch of other chemicals that I (and probably you) have never heard of.  Didn't bother me too much to read that on the label, but if you want a ""natural"" type hair conditioner, read the label before purchasing this one.",5
"I've used a lot dry shampoos and this is definitely one of my favorites. Smells great and adds lots of texture. Not the best for absorbing oils, but definitely give hair a little va-voom.",4
"This shampoo is marketed for ""damaged hair"" and claims (according to the packaging) that it ""repairs, softens and fortifies damaged hair"".  While my hair is color treated, it is in good shape so I may not exactly be the target audience for this product.This product is thick and creamy with a strong scent.  It's hard for me to describe the smell exactly, other than to say it's very ""perfumey"" - it does not have a floral, fruity or ""clean"" smell.  A small amount (quarter size) produces a lot of lather and it takes a fair amount of rinsing to get it all out.  I like the way it leaves my hair feeling clean but not with that ""stripped"" overly dry feeling.  I follow it with my normal conditioner and when I style as usual I'm pleased with the results.I would like to mention that Sodium Chloride (basically a sudsing agent) is high on the list of ingredients, which doesn't thrill me.  Many hair care professionals recommend that anyone with color treated or chemically straightened hair seek out shampoos that don't contain Sodium Chloride as it can be too harsh.  It is also an ingredient that may not be compatible with all keratin treatments, so if you fall into any of those categories you may want to check with your hairdresser.Would I recommend this product?  If your hair is not chemically treated but is dry/damaged this seems like a pretty decent shampoo.  If you have fine or thin hair this might weigh it down/make it look ""flat"".  If you are sensitive to fragrance - this isn't the product for you.Bottom Line:  Not bad, but budget permitting I'd recommend a salon quality shampoo free of sodium chloride.  I probably wouldn't purchase this product again.",3
"This product gave me acne and is very runny. I didn't understand the fuss, not for me. Wouldn't recommend this.",1
I love this soap.. I had problems with itchy skin which kept up most of the night scratching.  That is all gone now.Try it if you have very sensitive skin.,5
Ive tried so many face lotions and love this one. It is so light and the tint is perfect. I use it everyday and love that it has sun protection!,5
Best facial mask I've used so far.,5
I saw a review on this from a woman with darker skin and she said this made her look very ashy..I didn't believe her. How could a moisturizer make you look ashy?SHE WAS RIGHT!I have Tyra Banks skin color and my skin is oily so I bought this because of all thge other great reviews on how it worked really well to get rid of shine and give a matte effect. When I first out it on I couldn't get it to sink into my skin. It DID make me look INSANELY ashy because this does NOT sink into your skin at all. No matter how little you put on or how much you rub in it doesn't snk into skin and this is white so if you are like me you end up looking very ashy and pale and it's gross. And for some reason on my skin it doesn't even moisturize. After it dries my skin actually gets really dry and ashy! I was bummed because I spent money on this and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it so now I just mix a little of this with another matte moisturizer I have and it works a bit.I won't be buying this trash again. Darker skinned females beware.,1
"I have skin that dries out really easily, doesn't react well to scrubs, and full of acne. Finding products that treat my acne without leaving it dry or flaky or irritating it is hard to do. This is one of the best I have found. The salicylic acid helps keep the acne at bay, but it doesn't over dry my skin or bother it at all. I love the ""ice"" feeling- it's very refreshing in the morning! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and keeps it clear.",5
I love the smell and how it leaves my hands so smooth and soft -- I will order more of this for the price is right,5
"I bought this when Amazon offered a 20% off coupon.  To get the free shipping I went ahead and sprang for the matching body wash, and coconut lemon lotion along with another small item.  This lotion is pretty close to perfect.  It moisturizes without being greasy, and smells great.  I will be buying again.",5
"I got this product thinking it was a moisturizer with serious sun block, and I guess in a way it is, but it seems to be marketed as just a sun block. I wasn't thrilled with the color at first, which is somewhat dark for simple moisturizer, but fine for a sun block. It has a wonderful feel going on, and dries to what feels like a silky powder. I didn't have any problems using it under my mineral makeup, except that the color of the product darkened my look a tad, which is ok for the summer. It also did not make my oily skin shiny or greasy, even by the time I got home at night after a day in warm NC weather. After a few days of using it, I noticed my skin feeling silky smooth even after I washed it off. Unfortunately it's a little too pricey for me as either a sun block or a moisturizer, but if you're in the market for something like that and don't mind the price, you won't be disappointed.",4
"This shampoo has the milky white appearance and consistency of a typical conditioner. It produces a lot of lather and rinses out quickly. After rinsing my hair feels like it has a light coat of styling gel. This is odd because it leaves my hair dry and not very manageable.The shampoo has a strong floral and light woody scent. I'm not sure what lotus blossoms smell like but this shampoo is pleasant. The woodiness must come from the seaweed.Suave shampoos are always good for occasional use. I will frequently choose this brand over Prell, or VO-5 or White Rain and other popular brands that are in stock at the time I shop at the 99 cent store.",5
Sheds like a sick DOG....Hair is so thin its damn near see through ..Save your money!I won't buy again.  Lesson Learned!!!,1
"It was hard to tell from the photos how nice these bags really are.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and how good they look, even the heavy duty zippers are stylin'  -- I love them!  I am going on vacation soon and these cubes have inspired me to start packing.  Nice mesh &#34;window&#34; so you (and security!) can see the contents, and handles on each bag which is very helpful.  The drawstring close shoe bag is big enough for at least 3, maybe 4 pairs of shoes (or dirty clothes).  From the large cube down to the smaller toiletry size bag, you can't help but love these packing cubes/bags!  Would make a great gift for students or the traveler in your life.  I never would have thought &#34;packing cubes&#34; to be so helpful in staying organized while on the road.  I am very pleased with my purchase --- thank you!",5
"I am very happy with how fast you all replaced my broken jar of Silicon, Just received it a couple of days ago, when I reported the damaged jar. Today my new jar came, I really thought I was going to be just out of money, but you proved me wrong. Thank you for such great service. Now next time I can comment on the product Lol!!!",5
Love the sturdy box great size range for all nail sizes very sturdy but not too thick easy to apply we all use these in our nail salon I will order more when I get ow thank you so much,5
I purchased this due to the cost and variety. I have had it for a few months and I still cant use every color so many amazing ones! They all have a faint shimmer but the quality is nice. I always use their base colors since there is more of a matte look. The blues/greens/purples/browns are my favorite and they really make your eyes pop. I could care less for the others but the amount of great ones more than pays for this. the reds are very red and prominent.,5
"Im very pleased with this purchase. I wanted a white wavy wig that looked like Lady Death, and I sure got it with this one. It's easy to brush out and flows very nicely. Its has way more waves than in the picture and is layered extremely well! Also not a lot of shedding with this wig. It happens to be my favorite wig in my entire collection! I will be buying it in black as well.",5
"For those of us who have silver hair and want to wear modern styles and not have &#34;blue&#34; hair, this is the shampoo for us.I've used it for years.",5
"Yes, this is a great eyeliner, I wish I wouldve got it here its cheaper. Anyway, comparing this to covergirl,maybeline,and rimmel. With rimmel's (black magic) being pretty good except that its pencil and can get messy. This one was much better. No more tugging, or dry eyeliner.",5
Love it alone or with other colors.  Very eye catching.  So many compliments when I use it.  I will order again.,5
"My previous facial moisturizer was the Clean & Clear brand with salicylic acid and it was tingly and refreshing and I really liked it. It also didn't have any SPF protection.This one, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF15 is a little thicker and doesn't absorb into the skin right away (probably because of the spf properties) but it has all been smoothed in it feels light and makes my skin feel super soft.  I don't remember seeing if it had any acne fighting properties but my acne has actually decreased since I've been using it so whatever is in it has been working wonderfully. I'm really happy with the product.",5
"Great nail polish, works just like it says it does. i do recommend this to anyone .",4
"This product is really wonderful. I was looking for a highlighter to get the dewy, brightened look especially in the winters. I am fair and this product gives me the glowy look. It is a shine with a slight pink undertone. I would highly recommend it. One concern that I have with the product is that I noticed that it does not blend that well sometimes, but overall, it's great. Several people have commented on how my skin looks really healthy after I started using this.",4
"Soft after using on the beach or at the pool.  Little white, but smells and feels great so I recommend this product!",5
"This brush is AMAZING. I've been using it foreverrrr. I've tried more expensive brushes just to try something different to see if there is something better and I've always gone right back to this brush. I would purchase this over more expensive brushes any day and especially for the price, you can't beat it.",5
"I received a small sample bottle of this product with an HSI flat iron I purchased some time ago.  I used it anytime I straightened my hair and was quite impressed.  Previously my hair would look sort of dried out and fried after several days of straightening but with the use of this oil my hair looks great.  My current hairstyle calls for use of the flat iron daily and I've been wearing this style and using this oil for over six weeks.  My hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny.  I am in my early 50s and it is necessary to treat my locks with TLC.  This formula provides protection and moisture without weighing hair down.  It smells wonderful!  A few drops rubbed between my palms and applied to my wet hair before styling leaves me with soft, shiny, manageable hair.  A little goes a long way and my hair has never looked better.  You cannot go wrong with this product.  Highly recommend!",5
It works great for my OPI Gel color it helps it adhere longer without some nasty smell! and its OPI the best there is!!,5
"I use most of the brushes in the set every day. After the first wash some of them lose a few bristles here and there. I like that the bigger brushes come with protective sleeves to keep them in so they keep their shape. These brushes blend well, better than e.l.f. in my opinion. I love that they stay in the case so it makes traveling with them a lot easier. Overall I'm very happy with these brushes.",4
I was a  it unsure of this product when I purchased it and saw some reviews. However I must say I am quite pleased with the product and I have since re-ordered. I love the product because it works for me. My skin has been clear and is of an even tone. Really enjoyed this product.,5
This retinol cream is superb. It makes my face look healthy and gives it a glow from within.  It has no retinol irritation.  Avene products were introduced to me by an aesthetician when I had a recent facial.  She recommended the retinol (0.05%) that is less potent BUT just as effective as the higher level creams.  I have used other brand retinol products before but always ended up with unattractive and annoying peeling.  This one is just perfect.  I am sold on it and other Avene products.,5
Smells nice but doesn't work very well at taming flyways or conditioning dry hair.,2
"I think, these are not I believe they are all there I haven't taken the time to count them but hopefully the right amount is there the only things I didn't like is there are no gucci symbol and maybe 3 (lv) and 5 chanel symbols other than that they are nice I would purchase from the seller again despite the gucci missing it a nice price and very cute and appropriate size for styling nails!",4
Love that I can get a lot of these for such a cheap price. They come in many colors and individual packages. Definitely recommend these toe seperators.,5
"Neither my wife nor I loved this product. Does it moisturize? Yes it does. It's far thicker than most conditioners, making it slightly more difficult to work into your hair. Ideally, you're supposed to cover your hair and let this work for several minutes. Even after I rinsed the product out of my hair, I could feel some residue from the product in my hair, on my fingers, and on my face (I think this was the pumpkin, listed in the ingredients). The product did appear to provide deep, penetrating moisturization for my hair, but I prefer a product that's a little easier to work with.",2
"I have tried a bazillion shampoos.  This is THE ONE that works. I had three dime/quarter size psoriasis spots that were annoying beyond belief.  I had steroid shots in my scalp.  They worked for awhile then stopped. All other shampoos worked for awhile, maybe a week, then stopped.  This one I have used over a year now and this is what works.Word of caution if you color your hair... it will lighten your hair color.Save money and hair color:I just dab some shampoo on the spots, use that AWESOME scrubby brush that comes with it and rub the shampoo in the spots. I let it sit on my scalp while I brush my teeth first giving this a few minutes to sit there and do its thing. Then I jump in the shower, wet my hair and scrub (with the AWESOME brush) I do lather my whole head and let is set a little  time while in the shower but I use to let the shampoo be the last thing I did so it sat longer.  Saving color, I don't let it sit so long on my hair.  Its not a huge issue but it will lighten your hair over time.My hair is soft, not dry.  Other shampoos (especially prescription!) turned my hair into straw!  Not Nizoral.  Great stuff!!  Worth every penny.PS:  Scalp issues is an indication of something not in balance inside. Not eating wheat really helped me clear this up and...acupuncture. I swear by acupuncture!!!  It will fix a bunch of things at the same time.",5
"good buy, i would recommend this to anyone that wants to buy a cleanser, it has made my face clearer, and i would buy this again, but i should buy the larger size next time though... this one is too small, but when it finishes i am definitely getting a larger size..",4
"I have 4C class hair  and this product didn't hold my curls as I thought it would.  As soon as my hair dried it became a course kinky texture again.  I even used it as a setting product for a twist out and even though it soften my hair, the curl pattern didn't hold then either.",2
"I've been trying this one for awhile.  It's a very light scent so you won't feel as if you are lying in a cloud of perfume at bedtime.  Predominantly, the scent comes across as a very fluffy marshmallow spiced with sweet licorice.  The licorice is not strong as you might suspect.  It blends very nicely and doesn't overpower the creamy feel of the marshmallow. It's a sweet and comforting smell so I have no doubt that this is one that can make you fall asleep quickly.  I can't really say much on that subject because I can fall asleep in front of my computer if given the opportunity so sleep is not a problem... ever.Unfortunately for me, benzoin tends to smell a little medicinal and even in small amounts on my skin, I still get a slight ""bite"" of that note. This is a very nice perfume but one that I will have to pass on in the future because my skin chemistry throws it off a bit. I do believe though that a majority of others don't find benzoin to be a problem so I would never have a problem recommending this to anyone that wanted a relaxing bedtime scent.",4
"There is no cheap duplicate. I have expensive Chanel and MAC brushes. For an evening out when I want flawless makeup, this is THE TOOL. this is one item the makeup gurus on YouTube all agree on and I agree with them. I'm not a makeup artist. I just want to look like someone &#34;did my makeup&#34; when I have an important event, know I will be photographed, or need that confidence boost nothing like full makeup can give a girl immediately.This makes foundation application effortless and truly airbrushed. The only place I could find it was on Amazon. I ordered more as stocking stuffer-ish gifts for my mom next door friends who immediately noticed how amazing my makeup looked.The best part is that you can sheer your makeup down and actually save product with this.It's amazing. Love it! Seems pricey, but you get 2 in the pack and its pretty indestructible.Hope this helps!",5
I have ordered this before. I like it and would recommend it..Good quality product!Worth the money and at least worth a try for your skin.,4
"Product arrived inside of a box but the container itself arrived open, which I believe can compromise this product's freshness.  We'll see how it performs when I use it to make my body lotions.",3
"The colors are very nice and go along well with any other colors. The only con about this product is that the tops are hard to grip at times, causing random marks on the nails.",4
I really like this comb. I recieved it very fast. Can't wait to used it. I would recommend this product to others,4
It does create volume as advertised and the colour is quite vibrant.  The downside?  It clumps so be very careful when applying and use sparingly.,3
"Ordered this for my housebound parents. They are in their 80's. When we can't do the full shower routine, this makes them feel cleaner and fresher. Mom has really thin hair, Dad just had chemo treatments and his thick hair is thinning. This product worked well. They can even do it themselves. Nice, light smell.",5
"I've used this for a few years, ever since they came out.What it basically is is a glue strip you put over your nose and when you yank that off, out comes the blackheads and a tiny layer of the skin. How well it works for you depends on how delicate your skin is and how strong and deep the blackheads attach.As a long term user I can definitely say that it works very well. When I first started using them I had a lot of blackheads all over my nose and I can remember the strip being dotted with gunk when I pulled it off. Over the years I've gotten much less blackheads, to the point that I only use these once every 6 months or so. And each time I use the strips I only get a small amount of blackheads there now.So in summary, these have definitely worked great for me.",5
"I didn't think I would need 6 wig stands, but I quickly realized I like to keep a about 3 wigs ready, and I needed 1 stand to place my wig on at night, 1 to dry another with, and 1 stand available for travel.These are also easy to put together, don't tip over and the plastic seems to heavy duty enough to last. You obviously cannot style your wig on these as the stands won't keep it from slipping off if you tried, however for keeping a wig at hand, this is for you.This is truly one of those purchases that you did not know you needed until you got it.",5
The color is very pretty. Almost exactly like the picture shows it to be. I would recommend this color. It was perfect for breast cancer awareness mo.,5
"Motions at Home Lavish Conditioning Shampoo is labeled for medium to coarse hair. It wasn't until I received my bottle that I found it's advertised for ""women of color,"" which I'm not. Therefore, it may not have worked effectively because of my hair, though it is very thick and curly, so I'd expect it to work.I loved the smell, it's mild and not overly feminine, just nice and clean. Using just about 1 - 2 teaspoons I got far more lather than I expected. That aspect, again, I really liked. The rest of it, though, was nothing better than the shampoos I currently use.I skipped conditioner just to see how effective the conditioners within the shampoo worked. Skipping conditioner was a mistake. My hair frizzed as soon as it had dried completely. (I tend to let my hair dry naturally into whatever waves/ringlets it wants to form.)I did, however, have my husband who has fine, straight hair give it a shot. He doesn't use conditioner often, and he really liked it. Given that, I think your enjoyment of this shampoo depends on your hair type and typical procedure when it comes to your hair.UPDATE:I did try the shampoo with the anti-frizz conditioning cream. It makes a huge difference. Used together, my hair has never looked better. Curls are no frizzy and my hair feels amazing.",3
"This formulation does contain dimethicone. Dimethicone is a silicone-based polymer that forms a protective barrier to moisture loss but for some people it creates a problem when impurities are thus trapped on the skin. What Curel is promoting here are the ceramides they've put in. Ceramides are waxy lipid (combo of waxy and fatty substances) molecules that appear to have a role in apoptosis which is the normal process of programmed cell death. (In healthy individuals, cells are dying and being replaced constantly.) Some go so far as to call ceramides &#34;tumor suppressors&#34;. You can read for yourself in Wikipedia. It would appear the issue is not entirely clear.At any rate, the ingredient list reads like a chemistry text. But I am using this Rough Skin Rescue and although this is not the time of year when I have the worst drying/flaking problems, I can report that it is in fact free of scents (which you have to watch out for: quite a few products labelled scent-free and hypoallergenic in fact do contain these troublesome scents!) and very smooth and pleasing on my aging and embattled skin.",5
"I know this is for babies, however my son's eczema has gone away for the time being, so I decided to try it for my super dry hands and feet. It works! It instantly stopped the itchiness on my hands and the ashiness was gone! I use it only once a day, I am horrible with putting lotion on my hands and I'm a constant hand washer and instant hand sanitizer user so my hands are always dry. I am happy with this lotion!",5
"It took me more drops and time than I anticipated to bring my seche vite back to life, but that may just be because I waited too long to restore it.  Anyway, it worked although I am afraid to read what chemicals are in this product",3
"I don't really notice a different when using this product. My hair is a little smoother after blow drying but not dramatically different. I hope this product is working and actually protecting my hair, I just can't tell.",3
Im obsessed with these lashes and once again the seller did not disappoint. I will continue to be a faithful customer recommend them to all my friends. These lashes are extremely natural looking and I am constantly getting compliments.,5
It flakes on my black brows and my eyebrows do not hold their shape after a few hours. It's cheap though so I wasn't too dissapointed.,2
I use this all the time and love it. My hair is fairly long and I don't like hair spray,5
"Very nice case, zips easily and holds a lot of plates. Nice color too and I still need a couple of words, lol. done.",5
I use very lightly.  I have had a few compliments. I love the fragrance.  Just don't over spray.  Too much  makes it too strong.,5
This is a great mirror looks great on the vanity bought the oil bronzed and its perfect for my bedroom. Perfect size for me!,5
Irish Spring Gear Body Wash had a great fragrance. I love that it is 3 in 1. It de-clutters the shower in that there is no need for separate shampoo and moisturizer along with the body wash.,5
Arrived very quickly and with a bonus sample of eyelid primer.The color is beautiful and the primer so far works very well. I would highly recommend this product to others.,5
Dark chocolate color. Great fall and winter color. Three coats to get true bottle color. Compliments all skin color types.,4
"I like tinted sunscreen/moisturizers but usually they do not provide much coverage- This TARS product covers very well, creamy and smooth with great sun protection.  I keeps my skin from drying, helping to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  The seller backs with a 100% guaranty. fast shipping, good customer service.",5
"I wish I had taken a before and after photo of my hands.  My hands get terribly dry during the Wisconsin winters.  They get flaky, crack, and bleed.  I also have problems finding a good lotion since my hands get so bad.  This lotion did the job and did it quickly.  I noticed improvements during the first use.  My hands stopped flaking almost immediately.  While they still show some wear, overall my hands are soft, less cracked, and not bleeding.  The pump bottle is great and easy to use.  I also appreciate that it does not have some fruity smell to it.  This is a great product.  I will buy it and recommend others buy it too.",5
"from the reviews i thought this would have been a a really nice fragrance, but boy it was not at all good to me, i hope it grows on me since i got a big one, but for now it's just not doing it ,",2
"But she's wrong.  I don't know why she feels that it smells like bug spray because I love it.  She says it's not an unpleasant smell.  Anyway, I think it's a perfectly acceptable product that, in no way, smells like bug spray.",5
"So I am mid-20s and have acne-prone combination skin; I use lots of strong acne-fighting products which make skin more susceptible to sun damage, so I need a good sunscreen that doesn't break me out and preferably doesn't add to the oily look on my face. I've tried a bazillion different sunscreens, and so far I'm impressed with this one. I've only used this for 3 weeks though, and my skin tends to get adjusted and stop behaving once I've used the same product too long, so, I'll have to see how this works for me long-term.This is a bit thicker than the previous sunscreens I've used recently, but it's still easy enough to apply thoroughly, and while it goes on very white, it easily massages in or dries on its own, so I have no real problems with the texture or color.It does feel a bit thick when first applied, but my face doesn't seem bothered by it once its dried into the skin. It does still feel sticky even once dry if you touch your face with your hands, which I find gross, but I think that's actually a perk, since it discourages me from touching my face as often as I would want to, and that's important for reducing bacteria and thus acne.Also, it really does a great job of mattifying my skin. My skin looks completely matte when first applied, but within an hour, my skin looks normal healthy dewy, and it last almost all workday for keeping my skin from getting greasy. I usually pat my nose with an oil blotting paper at least once in the middle of the day, but the rest of my face looks great, and that works for me. It doesn't work for all day and all evening, though, so I do wash and re-apply it I am going somewhere in the evening and want my face looking perfect; otherwise, I just dab on a bit of shine control powder in the evening when I'm home from work to keep my face looking alright if we go out to dinner or something.I think it's definitely worth a try.",4
"This is top quality Argan Oil. If you are interested in non-processed, extra virgin, certified organic Argan oil, this would be an excellent choice.As with other non-processed, extra virgin oils, such as olive, peanut, or coconut oil, there is a noticable fragrance of the original fruit or seed. The fragrance has not been processed out. The scent of this oil is nutty and slightly smokey, unfamiliar perhaps but not unpleasant. It disapates quickly once the oil is applied.Each bottle is stamped with the date it was manufactured. Because there are no preservatives or additives to the oil the recommended shelf life is 36 months. It is best to purchase only what you need and use it; as with other non-processed oils, it will not last forever in your medecine cabinet.Argan oil, high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, is an excellent skin and hair moisturizer, used either alone or with other oils such as coconut. A little goes a long way. Start with a few drops and add more if needed.A sample of this product was provided in return for an unbiased review.",5
"I used this product for 2 months  and it completely changed the texture on my skin and feel of my skin made my skin soft as a baby,Unfortunately i liked how my old skin looked so i stop using it and trying to get my old skin back, yes it made my skin firmer, soft, etc but when i looked in the mirror idk, i just looked weird so i stop using it. My face felt thin out out. it did what retinol is supposed to so i can't say anything bad about it maybe it just  wasen't for me.  The product is very watery  and hard to use, it falls of your hand , I eventually got the hand of it eventually.Also if you buy this product buy it from a authorized seller, if you don't you're probably getting a fake product.",4
used this product a few times and did not notice a difference.  Probably will just go to a professional salon.,2
Great toner so far. Doesn't dry out my face and has helped with my skins oiliness. I have noticed some of my acne starting to go away since using it as well.,4
"The first time I smelled this scent, a friend of mine was wearing it when a group of us went to a play.  As soon as she came into the room I had to ask her what type of perfume she was wearing.  It was fairly new at that time, more than 10 years ago.  I went out the next day and bought my first bottle and I've been wearing it ever since.I'm really picky about perfumes and there aren't many that I like. Even many of the ones I like on other people don't smell good on me, but Angel by Thierry Mugler is one that I absolutely love. Whenever I put it on it just makes me feel good. The description of the fragrance is refreshing, oriental and woody with touches of vanilla, sandalwood, and patchouli. I guess I would agree with that description although it doesn't totally describe it. Do you know how it is when you're just drawn to a certain fragrance and you can't exactly explain why? Whenever I'm wearing it, even after several hours I still notice it and love the smell of it in my hair or on my wrist.One thing about this eau de parfum spray is that it is fairly intense. If you spray it on your pulse points you'll still be able to smell it 8 or 9 hours later. Sometimes when I don't want it to be too heavy, I'll just spray it into the air and walk into the mist.Although I used to change between a few different fragrances, since I discovered this one it's the only one I wear. Nothing else seems to come close. The star shaped bottle is really pretty too. The photo here doesn't do it justice.",5
"I have to admit, the only issue, and it's not much of one, is the smell of Fekkai Essential Shea Pot de Creme. I expected a floral scent based on the product description and instead it smells like Smarties (not the British M&M-type; candies but the fruity Smarties in the clear cellphone wrap). I thought it was just me until my husband told me my hair smelled like Smarties.Scent alone isn't really a deterrent, however. I wanted this product to work well, especially in the heat and humidity Vermont was dealing with last week. Hands down, the conditioning cream worked amazingly well. My hair never frizzed out, didn't feel greasy, and the softness and anti-frizz quality lasted all day. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. I even tested it on hair that only shampooed and then hair that I shampooed and conditioned. Both times, the results were flawless.",4
"My son's curly hair like this product. It does keep them shiny and lose. The scent is great, and it is not greasy.",5
"Insta Dri is the best nail polish I've ever used. Not only is it easy to apply but it literally does dry instantly. I was famous for smudging my nails because I'd be too impatient for them to dry. Never again will I have smudged nails. My nails don't chip easily with this stuff either. I put on two coats of color and a coat of clear (all Insta dri) and it's magical how quick they dry. The clear is always sold out in stores when I go to pick it up, glad I can order it from amazon.",5
"This is such a creamy, moisturizing, lovely smelling bath wash.  I love the scent of cherry and almonds and it comes out like a whipped cream.  To get 2 of these at this price can not be beat.  I can tell my skin feels silky smooth after using it.  You won't regret this buying this item.",5
This product was great!  Love It!  It works quite well.  Thank you for making such a quality product. It is really great.,5
This lipstick is great it just stains easily but it stays on your lips for a very long time. The color is beautiful and it was sent to me before my estimate date.,4
I gave this to my mother and she loves it. The smell is so inviting and it really softens the skin unlike most soaps. I would definitely buy from this brand again.,5
I have had this straightener before but in the 2inch one. I got it in my local drugstore when I was 15 years old and lasted me till I was 19. I had been looking for these again once that one bit the bullet. They sell this straightener in my local drugstore but for three times the price. Amazon was a better choice!!! Needless to say I am happy with the brand and the quality of their straighteners and glade I found this one. The review Is more based on my old one since I have not used my new one with the winter weather I have been having. I'll make an update soon. But I can already tell I am going to love it!!,3
"It really didn't work, I didn't see any changes and I used it multiply times as suggested yet the spot on my leg looked the same.",2
"I saw a commercial on As Seen On TV that was for a detangling brush. Before buying it, I read reviews of amazon.com customers. I quickly learned that the brush on tv was not so good. The best reviews were for Crave Naturals brush. I bought that for my 11 year old granddaughter who has waist length hair. She absolutely lo loves it. I'm buying two more for my other granddaughters.",5
"I will start by saying that glass nail files are superior to other types. This one is good but not the best. I have the kind of nails that have had friends saying &#34;those are real!?&#34;and nail techs have been impressed because they are strong and healthy. I credit that to using oil and a glass nail file regularly. The reason that this isn't the best is that after I file my nails then lightly drag them across bare skin they feel slightly gritty and scratch, I have another that leaves my nails absolutely smooth feeling. Other than that this is a good file, still far better than any other material, and I really do like the case.",4
"Amazing product , I love elf eye primerBecause ,still to long period and That make eye shdaw the best",5
Just a couple of drops will loosen up your expensive OPI nail polish and prolong its shelf life.  Great find!,5
"A few websites named this the best mascara saying how it lengthened the look of your lashes.  I don't really have a problem with length but I needed to replace my old mascara so I figured I'd give it a go.  BLECK!  This is the worst mascara, besides Great Lash, that I've ever bought.It's pretty wimpy given all of the expectations I had for it.  I had waterproof Lash Stilleto before this and while it looked great it could be hard to remove.  This stuff is about average in the removal department but if it doesn't make your lashes look thick and beautiful, it kind of defeats the purpose.  It might be for some people but my lashes say no go.",2
"I used this product for the prescribed 14 days in a row ~ it was fairly easy to remember to substitute these tubes for the oil-free hydrating gel I normally put on my face after cleaning it, every night.  The product was nice: I have normal skin that is a tad dry, and this product worked out just great for me...I used the tubes on my face each night, and never had any excess: I would just rub it all in & wait for it to soak up & ended up using it all.  Anyone who has oily skin may find that there is too much product in the tubes, but for my slightly dry normal skin, it was just perfect if I let it soak in!The first tubes were nice: a thick consistency kind of like a lotion, and the second set of tubes reminded me of conditioner for my face: and both smelled very nice!  The mask I really liked, and would like to purchse seperate to use once in awhie: it was cooling & nice, and I laid back & took a little 'nap' while it was working!I am 30 years old, and have a few wrinkles on my forehead, smile lines, etc. and I did see a difference in them!  I would buy & use this product again when I have some extra money, and do a few times a year (as recommended): I wasn't blown away by the product being 'absolutely amazing' or anything, but it was a nice little regime and I DID see some improvement on my face, so I would be willing to try it again & see how it goes if I keep using this product a few more times ~ recommended for those who want to help the lines on their face or to do something to get themselves into the habit of putting moisturizer/cream on their face every night!",4
Great quality and beautiful sharp images.  I especially love the design that looks like waves or water.  The thin lines come out really crisp.,5
"You have to go over the line a few times to make the liner full on opaque black. Once you do that it's pretty good. Long lasting and doesn't smudge. Very thin and precise. I still prefer Revlon's liquid eyeliner. It's a few dollars cheaper, completely black and matte, and works a hundred times better!",2
such nice cream . i like the texture it is very lifting  and contouring . its feels a bit think on the skin at first but yet you dont have sensation that face is sealed- skin breath easy . the one thing I did not like is parabens in the ingredients .  that make me wonder- why did they use it if company put natural benefit to work- why to poison  it? thank you,4
"My disclaimer is I have thick long hair.  I have been using another detangling brush for years and it works wonderfully.  I as excited to give this a try and honestly, it was just ok.  Didn't get through much of my hair, awkward to hold and use and hurt a bit as well.  Again, not horrible but just ok.",3
"I had to review this product when I saw it had one star by someone else & in my opinion that is not at all deserved. I use several different BB creams & have tried many. I should add that I am nearly 50 years old and have lolive skin that is normal. No lines or wrinkles but uneven skin tone. I use light to medium in other products but need med-dark with this one. I use Garnier BB cream for casual daytime wear. For me it evens out my skin tone and is easy to spread. It does leave my face glowy and not matte. However like all BB creams if you want it to look polished use a small amount of sheer powder. Sometimes instead of powder I use Garnier BB Cream med-dark for OILY skin OVER this in just a few areas. I tried the one for oily skin alone and for me it just didn't have the glow this one does. But if I put on this BB cream and then just tap some of the oily skin product on areas that need a little more matte, it works well. But most will prefer a bit of sheer powder.  As I said, I use this when I need to rush out the door and I think it's easy to blend too. If so I won't bother with powder or anything. But I may dot on the Garnier BB cream for oily skin over it if I have time. For contrast, when I want to look polished I use a higher end Korean BB Cream called Missha. That one requires a little more focus to blend properly. I use no. 27 which I would have though was too dark but I tried 23 and it seemed like it wasn't right for olive toned skin. So I strongly recommend Missha BB cream for the most polished look and more skin flaws. This Garnier works well if your skin mostly needs evening out and you want a casual daytime look. If your skin is truly oily try the oily skin version alone.",5
I was looking for a mosturizer that wasn't too heavy for the hot & humid summer days. This is a great option and it also has SPF 30 so no additinal sunscreen is needed (unless you're outside all day.),4
Great amount for the price,4
"I used this for the first time today and was delighted to find that it removed my waterproof mascara very easily. Truth is, I actually stopped wearing mascara for a while because my previous eye makeup remover just couldn't do the job of removing it fully. I'd be tugging at my lashes (which is a big no-no) only to still find traces of mascara afterward.The lotion consistency of this remover makes it very easy to simply rub it onto my eyes without tugging, following which, I simply wipe it off with a large cotton pad before going in the shower. I'm pleased to report that it removed my mascara very quickly with minimal fuss, and I loved the moisturizing effect it had on my skin.Now I wish I had discovered this little gem much earlier! With a price like that, it's safe to say that this has definitely made it to my personal 'must-have' beauty list.",5
"The shampoo works great, but I would say it is best for people who do not have oily hair.  The scent is great, the shampoo suds up very well, and really gets hair clean, but because of the conditioner, I only can use it occasionally as it will get my hair too oily.  I would say it is best for those with dry hair.",4
"HAVE TRIED VARIOUS SHADES OF NUTRISSE, FAIRLY GOOD MATCH TO ACTUAL PRODUCT SHOWN ON BOX.  GENTLE ON THE HAIR  JUST WISHED IT LASTS LONGER....",4
My family uses mostly all natural and organic. Many people are finding out about the benefits of organic food but still don't recognize the chemicals we put on the outside of our bodies matters just as much as what we consume. I love that this has no chemicals and artificial fragrances. I put this on my boys today and it rubbed in clean and not oily and they didn't burn. So it works and it's healthy.,5
"This product definitely lives up to it's high reviews. My skin looks clearer and pores look smaller. With people with adult acne issues, this won't solve your problem, but it does help acne heal faster. What more could you ask for in a facial mask?For those that say this is hard to wipe off, you are not applying it thick enough. Make sure you apply it with your hands for a thicker application, and when you're ready to take it off, wet a washcloth in warm water, put it up to your face in sections and it just wipes away.Also, make sure you apply a good moisturizer after while your face is still wet, because it does have a drying effect on your skin.",5
"My husband loves the Dove Men line! They are his favorite products to use.This review is his opinion, not mine. Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)It smells manly, but not overwhelming. He likes the way his skin feels after using it.Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.",5
"Loved it! If you are into getting microdermabrasions at the salon, then this is a great way to save money. I'm a satisfied customer.Pros:* The head pieces are great...they have a guide right on the box to let you know which headpiece is for what specific need (face, scars, nose etc...)* It comes with enough circular filters and extra accessories.* The unit is small which is perfect to store anywhere.* The suction is great for at home use and the dial is easy to turn.* Not noisy* Cost effective* Smooth skin ( Helpful hint:  Remember to use extra sunscreen after you microderm because you want to protect the new layer of skin from harmful rays.)Cons:* My only issue is that it came with two (one blue and one red) pieces which aren't explained in the guide. I tried looking for it online as the guide suggested but the video didn't show the same model. I assumed it was some type of filter so I attached one end to the microdermabrasion machine and the other end to the tube.",4
"Works good, good cover and creamy. would buy again. Sort of like MF (old stick makeup of Max Factor thar u cant buy anymore at stores).",5
"I bought 1 pack of these KNOWING that it was recommended to buy 2 packs.Shipping was FANTASTIC. It was set to get here sometime in April (a month away) and it came a WEEK after ordering!The extensions themselves are beautiful. I got the medium brown and LOVE the color. It has like a slight hint of red that's only noticeable in the sun, makes me sad that I have to dye over it :(Now, as everyone keeps saying, they are quite thin. BUT if you know some tricks, and you only bought one pack, you can make it work.What my problem was, they didn't quite fit all the way around my head.So what I did was I pulled the sides of my hair back and voila! Problem solved.I will be buying another pack here very soon though. I don't want to always have to pull my hair back like that. But for now, it works!(Note: I got the 20"" 70G extensions. The length is amazing! I'm happy I didn't decide to get the 22""! The 20"" is almost to my waist.)So all in all, I really recommend these extensions. But definitely buy 2.",5
"This oil came in the expected time period. I have purchased this same oil from the local health food store and loved it. This was not the same oil. It still smells fine but it is watered down or somehow changed. The fragrance isn't strong and it's weirdly thin.I gave this a 4 because it still smelled fine, but I definitely wouldn't order this again.",4
The Ponds Luminous exfoliating cleanser is a mild cleanser that works very well.  It has a faint rose smell (typical to Ponds products) and is fairly easy to apply and wash off.  The exfoliation is very mild (compared to some of the peach cleansers I have used) but it works well without over drying your skin.  Also worth noting is that it will not clog your pores to precipitate acne like some of the competing products on the market.  Overall this is great for daily use.,4
"I purchased this product in hopes it would help with my acne.  Although my acne is not severe, it is moderate and I have had it since I was 14 and I am now 34.  I have tried just about everything out there except accutane.  I have been on Retin A numerous times, antiobiotics, birth control, differin gel, tea tree oil, sulfur soaps, salicylic acid products, alpha hydroxy acid products and so much more.  I have FINALLY found the right product.  This product every other day along with Retin A Micro has been a God send for my face.  I am African American and have light skin, but I produce a lot of melanin and I always have hyperpigmentation after the blemishes heal.  I am noticing a HUGE difference with exfoliation and lightening of these scars with the products I listed above.  I found out about the product during a google search looking for acne solutions.  If you are like me and have tried everything, please give this a try it might be the product for you.  Also, I have always had extremely oily/shiny skin.  That also has gotten better.",5
"The Dove Men Antiperspirant is both effective and nice smelling.  It goes on easy and does not need to *dry* before putting on your shirt.  Previously I have used Degree Antiperspirant for the last few years. Degree has a stronger scent (although it is not unpleasant) than the Dove. While it claims to *last* for 48 hours I have not had a chance to try out the full 48 hours (I am a 1-shower a day kinda guy), but it is certainly effective for a 24 hour period!Final Verdict - I am happy with the Dove Men Antiperspirant. It works well and I have not had any adverse effects.4 1/2 Stars",5
"So far these polishes are beyond my expectations! I love all the colors and they only need one coat to be opaque. They are so gorgeous and eye catching. This is the first time I've bought this brand and I'm very pleased and I will be buying more. The only problem I have is that the odor is kind of odd and very strong, but they are so pretty that it's not gonna stop me from using them. I would 100% recommend these! :)",5
"I really love these clips! A pack lasts me a year or so before I lose them mysteriously. They hold out well for coloring hair, cutting hair, and styling them well. I recommend them and they are colorful and good to look at.",5
I love the adult Seki nail clippers and was disappointed in these. I thought they would be wonderful but had problems getting them to go over the nail.,2
Overall really nice. Tweezers work well. Rhinestone are good quality for price. Dotting tools are good. only wish we got as many rhinestones as the picture shows. containers arent even half full. : /,4
"Shalimar has been my signature fragrance for decades. For a while in my 30's I used a less expensive similar alternative, but it was eventually discontinued and I came back to my beloved Shalimar. I never tire of the soft, subtle, powdery vanilla scent and have received many compliments on my scent over the years. I used it sparingly and a bottle can last up to a year. It makes an easy gift giving opportunity for my husband or daughters. I asked my husband for a new bottle for Christmas; though I usually get the eau de toilette, he got me the Eau de Parfum instead, and I'm not complaining!  The gift box is so elegant that I hate to throw it away....The official Product Description (below) is quite a work of art.  I always feel &#34;calmly intrepid&#34; when wearing Shalimar !&#34;Soft oriental voluptuous, sensual, spellbinding Tonic top notes of fresh flowers and bergamot are calmly intrepid. Like the savvy disorder of rumpled silk sheets, powdery notes of iris, jasmine and rose suggest or promise sensual embraces. The creamy softness of addictive vanilla, the penetrating charm of iris, the balmy roundness of opoponax and the gourmand warmth of Tonka bean orchestrate an intimate symphony of scent for languorous interludes.&#34;",5
"I think this is a really awesome product. It has started working for me with toning up my skin on my face, neck. I am impressed with the results. I would recommend this as a A+ product very well trustworthy and does what it says it will do. I would buy this product.",5
"I am already very fond of this brush. When used for normal brushing (as an experiment), it made my hair soft, smooth, and super shiney. When used with a hair dryer for a nice blowout, my hair comes out fantastic. I haven't had the bristle issue that I saw mentioned on here, yet. My only complaint about this brush is the fact there there isn't a nonslip grip. The handle is glossy, so it is easy to slide when turning in your hair. I didn't feel that the handle was too small either, which was a commom complaint that I saw on here. Over all - a great brush and almost perfect!",4
"I've tried a lot of makeup removers from other brands, big and small. After a friend from Hong Kong recommended me Bioderma H2o I fell in love with it after the first use!! It doesn't smell, cleans thoroughly w/t leaving any residue, works for face AND eyes, and only needs a little every time. It doesn't dry out your skin at all, on the contrary, my face feels very smooth.I",5
"Its really good, and it doesn't irritate my skin, feels good too but I wish it was a bit more matyfing and not so greasy.",4
I've changed my mind.....This mascara doesn't do it for me anymore.  I haven't been using this for awhile now cause the formula dries up quickly and worse I keep seeing a bunch of black flakes all around my eyes and cheeks after I put it on.  I regret buying another one.  I found another way better & cheaper mascara I've been using.  If you would like to know which one you can contact me.,1
"I just got hooked on lipstick, which is a little odd because the last lipstick I bought before my obsession (Bobbi Brown's Party Alice) wasn't amazing. But this is better than BB, it doesn't dry my lips out and the color lasts for the whole day. I'm medium skinned and Tea Rose is my color. I apply when I leave for work/school in the morning and when I come home at night, it's still on! I've gotten countless compliments for my new color.",5
"This is a thick and creamy sunscreen that is easy to apply. It stayed on despite sweating, and my skin did not burn or redden even though the day was quite sunny.I'm not in love with the scent, but overall this is an effective sunscreen that feels good on my skin.",4
"This Conair comb is well-made and durable. My hair is very thin which is easy to scratch my scalp. However, it has never scratched my scalp once. I love Conair's products. This comb is awesome. I highly recommend!",5
Wow. Just wow. I didn't expect crap from this but....wow. This gets me darker than Fake Bake. Fake Bake actually didn't do squat for me but this stuff tanned my entire body. I was hesitant to use it and figured I'd be sending it back just.....wow. Great stuff! Highly recommend!,5
"I've been using a dish sponge, yes, you read that right, a dish sponge to wash my body in the shower.  Granted it's a nice spong, the kind that has a mesh lining on it and costs about $3 at my local grocery store...but I thought it was time to commit, to an actual body sponge.  I'd read on here, after researching, that the Buf-Puf Double sided body sponge was pretty awesome, so I went ahead and ordered it.  I've used it 2x only and I have to say, I get excited (don't look into this too much please) about scrubbing down in the shower now ;-) I also hate mushy soap and use most soaps that come out of a container but a friend gave me a beautiful bar of soap and this scrubber grabs the soap so it's left fairly dry (the soap) and doesn't just sit there (like I'd let it) and build up into a soapy mush.  The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side, good for elbows, legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back.  The other side is soft enough to use on your face, neck, inner arms etc.  Overall, I love this little sponge!",4
"This was a nice rich shampoo. It lathered nicely but I do not believe it changed the way my hair felt. It seems very high quality and a little goes a long way, unlike other shampoos.",3
"Most people may think that this product was directed to women, but it didn't appear that it wouldn't work for a man too, so I decided to give it a try when I saw it on the Amazon Vine List. Nobody is getting any younger and maybe it would buy me some time - a pun on the product name there.The creme itself is white and has a slight, pleasant smell. Not a ""lady"" smell. The texture is smooth, and it goes on easily. I've tried it several times, and it gave me no problems.But, does it work really well as is claimed by the maker? Well, that is a bit hard to say. These things can be very subjective and just hard to evaluate, period. One thing to mention is that users are directed to use it twice a day. Once a day was about the most I could manage. Guys usually put moisturizer on after shaving, if at all, and not many shave more than once a day. And I'm sure that I didn't put it on every day, since I skip shaving on weekends at least.The price of $135 for 1.7 ounces is a lot of money, unless the stuff lasts a long time and works really well. Not really sure I can be objective on either point. Sorry, I can't be more helpful in this review. If I have more to report later, I'll update this.",3
"I was hesitant to put any type of oil on my acne-prone face, but my dermatologist recommended a facial cleansing oil to remove make up before washing my face. This product is now a permanent part of my skin care routine. Note: apply with DRY hands to DRY skin, then rinse off and was face as usual.",5
"I purchased this and another product,Fake Bake Fair Lotion, 6-Ounce, intending to try both and see which one worked best but I liked the Nature's Gate so well I've put off trying the other one.I have fair...as in so white it is like a dead fish belly...skin. I only need this for my legs so I can wear skirts and shorts without being scary. I have the naturally fair undertones of pink and blue. I *can* tan, but after spending the 80s as brown as a walnut, I do try to avoid naturally tanning now.This lotion isn't meant to make you brown, only to add some natural looking sun inspired color. If you are looking for more than that, then you'll be best served with one of the more aggressive products.This looks just like regular lotion in the bottle and smells like a pretty standard lotion too. You simply rub it in like regular lotion and then wait until it is fully soaked in. Dress like normal and within 24 hours you'll see a hint of color.In reality, you'll want to put regular lotion on your hands first so the skin on your hands won't soak up this lotion. Then when you put on the Glow lotion, be more careful than you otherwise would to get a pretty even coat but go lightly over the knees and ankles, since those areas tend to soak up more lotion in general and therefore, will get darker. Then sit around for about 20 minutes just to be sure you're all absorbed and dress. I like to do this after work so I can just wear my loungewear and not risk nice clothing, though I have seen no proof that it comes off on clothes at all.Right after application, wash your hands vigorously and thoroughly and use a washcloth or something rough.As to results, I noticed a light tan by the next morning after first usage. That's about 16 hours of time. I used it again that night and it was darker the next day. I did that again for 2 more days and on the 5th day I woke to the dreaded color ORANGE.That wore off after a couple of days and I was back to glow.The lesson is that you won't need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person. More after that point is not better.Trial and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color. After a couple of weeks I'll go two days in a row to get the color back up to peak, and then back to every third day.Given how fast it works, this bottle will last a long time.Highly recommended for people who will not naturally tan, either because they want to preserve their skin or because they burn and who embrace their fairness but want enough color to blend in with the world. Not recommended for people with very yellow undertones in their skin because they will likely turn orange faster. Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan.",4
"I got this mascara today. It wasn't as great as I had expexted but it'll do. I was hoping it would be as good as The Falsies but it is not. Tested it out on my sister as well, didn't work well either. Well, this is a first impression, I've only had it about an hour or so, but I will update if I find something to be impessed with.",3
they dont work,1
"I ordered OC8 in the past, the picture shown above is the one I got previously and that one worked great. Although it didn't last 8 hours it lasted a good hour or 2 and left my face matte not shiny. However when I ordered this through Amazon, I got the newer version, not pictured above. That one does not work at all! It leaves my skin slick and shiny and does not matte at all. Not sure if I was sent a fake one or not but it did not work.",1
"Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate.What is all that?Anyway - I have 50 year old very dry skin and after following the application directions carefully (squeeze a small amount into hands and work into a lather) and liking the result on my face and neck now also use it in the bath on my dry arms and dry legs to noticble improvement.",4
"I found the Moroccanoil Restorative Hair Mastk much too oily for my hair, plus there was a smell that I found none too pleasing.",2
"My skin is dry, and I have always believed that I look better without face make-up than with it. Unfortunately, as one grows older, the hunt begins for help to revive a less young face. You may have a very different experience with this product, but I found that it was hard in its container. It pulled my skin to try to apply it, and I didn't care for the match to my much lighter skin. This was just my experience. All kinds of women of all ages shop Amazon. My feedback is honest, I don't mean to hurt the seller. The color wasn't a good match, and I may have just received an old product by chance.",2
unfortunately I get absolutely no color boost whatsoever with this lotion. I also dont feel any warming at alll. I will use it up though because I love how it feels on and it dosent have dha so i`ll keep it in my rotation but sadly I will not repurchase.,3
"It is an okay under makeup moisturizer, but I can't say that I notice any difference I the &#34;ultra-lift claim&#34;.",3
I was really hoping that this product would work for me. Unfortunately this product did not do anything at all for me.,2
"The bright colors of this brush make it cute, but for me I found it difficult to keep in my hand.  The back is somewhat slick and slid way too much in the palm of my hand.  I felt too, that it tugged way too much when detangling finer hair.  No matter how I tried to hold the brush it just wasn't comfortable in my hand, and personally I have &#34;bigger&#34; hands so wonder how it would fit in a person with smaller hands.  I also noticed more hair residual in the brush after using it, so really wondering IF it was detangling my hair or just breaking or pulling it out. It was lightweight in feel and I prefer a detangler with a bit more substance.",3
"I normally love TIGI products and have a few other hair products that I have been using for a long time.  I decided to give this shampoo and conditioner a try after reading that it is good for dry hair.  I have naturally wavy, course hair that I straighten twice a week (normally with a flat iron), and the heat has taken it's toll on my poor hair.  I was really excited to give this stuff a try after reading the good reviews.The shampoo and conditioner smell delicious...like it should be a candy or cocktail!  However, the shampoo doesn't leave my hair feeling clean at all.  It actually makes my hair feel greasy WHILE I'm washing it and makes my scalp really flakey and gross once I'm out of the shower.  Not sure why...maybe I'm allergic to something that's in it, or I just got a bad bottle of shampoo, but I've never had this reaction with anything else I've ever used on my hair...ever!So I tried experimenting to find out if it was just me and maybe the cold, dry air in the winter months, or if it was the shampoo/conditioner that was causing the flakes.  I switched back to my old shampoo/conditioner, and my hair/scalp went back to normal again!  The next time I washed my hair, I tried my old shampoo, with this TIGI conditioner (on the ends only) and my hair seemed fine.  Then back to the TIGI shampoo/conditioner, and my scalp was gross again.  So, apparently it's just the shampoo that's the problem, and the conditioner seems to be ok as long as I don't massage it in my scalp.I plan on using my old shampoo and the TIGI conditioner till it runs out, and will try something else next time.  Too bad! :(",2
"Update:After using the product a second time I noticed burning if the product got on my cuticles at all (before curing). Then after my third time using the product my nail beds just ached even after curing and I had to remove it after a day. This is an allergy to the polish - it seems both the base/topcoat and the nailpolish itself cause me allergies. I have not had allergies with gelish. I know allergies happen but I wanted people to know that if you are allergic to this brand you may not be allergic to all brands.Also my lamp started not producing enough UV to cure the polish after about 1 month. I did end up buying the gelish 18 g and am happy going to all gelish product.--------------------Previous review.I am so excited to have found this product. It is an excellent deal to get the whole kit for this price (though generally it is cheaper in stores). I found it very easy to use and my first manicure lasted 9 days without a chip before I decided I wanted to change it and I had a lot of growth. I have subsequently kept nail polish on 2 weeks before I wanted a change. This is revolutionary to me as I can usually not get away with more than 1.5 days of a regular manicure without chipping due to my weak, peeling nails. This meant I would spend lots of time changing my nail polish which in the end was more damaging than the soak off from this product. The product gives a measure of strength to my nails which has allowed me to grow out the split portions and has increased the overall health of my nails. I also use Solar Oil daily and feel that this is also helpful in replenishing any moisture lost from the soak-off. Regarding the soak off process, it is a little annoying but worth it for the amount of wear I get out of the polish. Be sure to buff off all of the shiny top coat before beginning the soak-off. Heat helps speed the process too.In order to be able to use this product you will have to have a very steady hand and be able to keep the product off of your skin and cuticles as you work. Do not cure the product with it on your cuticles - you will not be able to remove it later. It is also important to not get the product on your skin as some people can become allergic to gel products with repeated exposure.One further tip I have is that after curing the base coat, wipe off the sticky layer with a dry lint-free pad. This will prevent the colored layers from shrinking up from around the edges of the nail. I think this is more of a problem with darker colors.I have also had success using Gelish nail polish with the lamp which is a bonus. If I get more into gel polish I may get a larger lamp but for now this is great for home use. I would appreciate seeing more of a color selection in the future from Nailene but as I can use Gelish this is not a big detractor for me.",3
"This has been a staple for me since '99. Typically I use different scents for different occasions, seasons and even outfits. This fragrance however is one of the more versatile variety. Fresh & citrusy enough for daytime use but spicy & mature enough to wear out at night. It's a Summer fragrance imho but I can see using it during the Winter because I detect a slight proximity to Dolce & Gabbana pour homme in that it contains a level of spice and maturity. It also lasts for the better part of the day and projects well. As always I ONLY purchase fragrances from AMAZON or HIGHLY RATED vendors not the ""lowest priced"" and have never had an issue w/ authenticity.",4
"I have relied upon Arnica for decades for relief and to expedite healing of bruises, pain, inflammation, injuries, swelling, stiffness and soreness after exercise. Dr. King also makes a topical cream of Arnica that you can apply to a local spot whereas this oral spray works better but is still effective for overall body symptoms. I really like that Dr. King's homeopathic oral sprays are free of alcohol, dairy, gluten and sugar. I like the results I get with Dr King's homeopathic remedies and recommend them to others frequently.",5
This really helped my ears! I felt like pressure and they hurt a bit. I tried this for 4 days and it was like a major ear cleansing! I recommend it!!!!!!!,5
"Ok before I got this  read all the reviews on it. I was afraid to order it. I have sorta crazy hair thats different because Im what you called  ""mixed chick"". Theres even a hair product you can look up on Amazon now that will explain that if you dont know what that means lol. Anyway when this roller set came I looked at it.. plugged it in.. planned it on purpose for a night I wasnt' going anywhere in case things didn't go well. Well.. guess what. Things went great. This set rocks.. and Im gonna tell you why.. I tested it not only on my mixed chick hair but on my friends hair that is a real blonde with super straight unchemical touched hair. It totally made us both look good. I think the people that complain it leaves ""marks"" in their hair dont understand how to really DO thier hair. We had no ""marks"" in our hair.. wasn't even a issue. It really does curl fast.. if I had to say one bad thing I'd say.. well its a little tricky to grab those clips fast.. they are hot.. you have to work fast is the key. I wish they came with something on the clip so the clip wasn't so hot where your fingers touch... but in all fairness every hot roller set I've ever used you wind up working quickly if you have any sense because the end of the roller will sting your fingers. This is no different.. not worse. I think some people shouldnt' be able to write reviews because they dont even bother to figure out how the product really works. This set got a bad rap in reviews unfairly. Buy this with confidence. Your gonna look great. Hey if you get what they discribed as a mark in your hair.. just take your blow dryer after you secure your hair in a clip and smooth it out.. get over it... its not big deal.. dont blame it on the product. Im A.Zerkle. I approve this message. lol.",5
"These rollers are fine for what i needed them for.  Only gripe i have, is that i have never used this type of roller before, and there were no instructions included on how to use them (for first time users) . So i will just have to use trial and error i guess. Other than that they're just fine.",4
"RCM and Gelish are apparently the same brand so I was confident prior to buying this that it would work for my Gelish system and my RCM colors equally well.  It did.  In fact, this is SO superior to my regular UV light that I won't ever go back.  It clearly cures faster but harder as well.  I guess maybe my bulbs were weakened in my regular UV light.  It's not like there's a gauge or anything, so really, how would I have known?I do an entire hand at once, I just pick up the light with my other hand and curl my ""to cure"" nails in (like I'm gripping a tennis ball).  Works just fine.  In fact, I like that I don't have to maneuver wet nails into a small box because my nails always seemed to hit something or find dog fur somehow.  Also, it's kinda cool to watch.  The Gelish Top It Off glows under the light so I can see if I've missed an area, like the tips.  Just don't be an idiot like me and do touch ups with the top coat while the light is still on.  You will ruin the brush.  On the plus side, it was cool to watch it cure...less cool that it cured to my nail.  Yes I know.  Very dumb moment.Also, it is my understanding that an LED light is still a type of UV light, so clear folks like me should be aware.  Luckily it's only 45 seconds per layer (unlike the 5 minutes for my old UV!) so it's still no where near as dangerous.",5
"So, i just purchased this product and arrived yesterday. I NEVER had a chemical peel in my life, so i was really careful with the product. I didn't put the peel on my cheek, i wanted to try the acne prone area: Forehead & Chin first before i proceed. Well, i put it on for 1 min and washed it off with cold water. it feels really cool and refreshing when the product is on my face. No pain or sting at all. After that I rinse it out really well with cold water. Amazingly, the product doesn't try up your skin right away. It just creates like a real thin layer, then i applied moisturizer and went to bed! This morning i woke up, no peel... feels the same. thats why i don't know if this product is really working yet. I need more time to tell. But it does feel really good when its placed on your skin. Think about it! Most acne clearing gels have 2 % salicylic acid ingredients, this has 20% ... so, it has to work in the long run. i'm really optimistic! Will update soon!_______________________________________________________After 5 uses, no significant sign of improvment. I love the refreshing feeling of the peel after its washed off. Should i be using this product every 2-3 days ? I'm also using the Glycolic Acid Peel 35% which i feel does create an overnight smoother skin texture.",4
This is nice fragrance and I do not regret purchasing it. It will only enhance your special evening rather on a special date or right out of the shower/bath before retiring for the evening.,4
"I have extremely coarse/thick/unruly/curly hair so I have to use blow dryers with mega-heat (I recently discovered FHI which has become a holy grail beauty item for me), and was always frustrated that within a few minutes the bristles on other brushes would get too soft, making it difficult to grab the hair (difficult to explain--hopefully you know what I mean).  But with this brush, that doesn't happen at all!  I love that the barrel is so big; it helps me blow my hair out much faster.  This brush, combined with my dryer and using Aveda's ""Smooth Infusions"" styling products, I can blow out my hair and end up with beautiful results--I can't remember the last time I picked up my flat iron!",5
"I am so so glad I discovered this product! I got it for free at an event, and kept it around but never used it. I have been suffering from acne around my mouth for years, and it comes on and off. My skin is very sensitive, and whenever I try beauty products in a store I come away with something bad. I tried lipsticks and came away with acne, or probably its the vaseline I use, not sure. Anyway, I was getting acne one after the other in that area right next to the one that just cleared and I was super embarrassed at going to work, it was also painful. I recalled having this product and tried it on. Right before my eyes, the size of one acne reduced! I was so impressed. I use it twice everyday, and it is helping clear out the acne. There is one persistent acne that just will not clear because it has not come out fully, it hurts a bit, but this product has reduced its size and I am hoping that it will go away completely. I have been using this for a week now, I do hope that it helps clear away the blemishes as well.I usually prefer things going away naturally, but am glad I found this product. I will keep using it. Yes it is drying, but there are moisturizes that cure that, so not a reason to stop using this product unless there is a better one.",5
Product did not work for me at all.  I tried for over 20 days without success.  After thus I decided to trash it.,2
I love taking care of my skin and I as I am aging I am always looking on things to improve the condition of my skin.  I loved this product.  It was light and absorbed instantly.  I loved how after a week the condition of my skin greatly improved.  A little goes a LONG way but after applying to face I always rubbed my hands together and I even noticed a change in the skin from my hands.  I will recommend to all my friends. A++++++,5
"I have the soap, roll-on perfume, the spray and the incense. I just find this to be the most natural smelling lilac perfume out there.",5
"I guess the title of my review says it all, while I have nothing but praise for the person that I bought this item from ( super fast shipping ) the actual product is just meh, the quality feels a little flimsy and I'm not sure how long it will actually last, it's still cute so I'll use it to organize loose stuff in my purse.",4
The cilors are nice very pigmented  a little goes a long way colors last allday with no creaseing ive recomended shany to my clients so they can recreate whst i do for them at home also with any eyeshadows u need to use a primer yet i deffinetly recomend any of shanys products :),5
Ok.. I loveeee fall.  I have been wanting this lipstick for so long.  Love it.  Gives you an edgy and bold look.  Love it and will absolutely buy it again.,5
"None of these products worked very well for my fine, wavy color-treated hair.The shampoo got very thick after only a few weeks use and is impossible to get out of the bottle.  It still works OK but is irritating and messy.The conditioner made my hair feel heavy and weighed down.I saw no benefit from the treatment oil.  I vastly prefer the Neil George gooseberry oil.",2
"I need to wash my hair daily due to the oily build-up. My hair takes a lot of abuse from my daily use of the hair dryer, hot rollers, and flat iron. I am absolutely in love with this product. After washing my hair and towel drying, I apply three drops to my hands and then rub it through my hair. Once my hair is blown dry, I can style it or leave it straight. My hair is silky smooth and manageable. The shine is out of this world! The next day, my hair isn't oily! Hooray! I will definitely add this product to my hair care regimen.",5
I'm in my 60s and never had great lashes until I bought Rapid Lash on Amazon. Now I have great lashes but the trouble I've had was finding the right mascara. I bought expensive ones and cheap ones and this one by far beats them all!!  No clumping!!!  Fantastic!!!,5
Does what an undereye concealer should so without cluming or drying out the skin. I will never use anything else.,5
"I'm getting to the age where I could use some skin tightening, wrinkle reduction, spot reduction, smoother complexion...I'd be happy with any improvement in any area really.  This did NOTHING...It does have a lovely, soft pleasing scent, but it's really just an expensive moisturizer, not an antiaging creme.",1
Simple Human makes some of the better home products I have ever used and even down to hand soap is no exception.  A sample of this came with a Simple Human dispenser we bought and we enjoyed it so much that we had to continue using the refills.  And we have no regrets.  It leaves our hands clean and squeaky with sufficient moisture.  I found no single element of its ability to clean defective and that alone is important to me.  It is indeed a product I highly recommend.,5
"The bottle I received did not have the handle spray pump, but just the small press down nozzles. It was a little tough at first but ended up fine and gave a nice fine mist. It also smelled nice.However, it had no effect on my hair. There was no change in smoothness versus frizz. There was no way to tell that I did anything different to my hair. So really it is a nice smelling water.",2
Not shiny and doesn't prevent chips. I bought this to add to my topcoat collection and am only going to use it for my toes or manicures I don't care about. BUY SECHE INSTEAD OF THIS,2
"I use this as a leave in conditioner. I put a glob on, comb it through and put a shower cap on and leave on for about 10-15 minutes. My hair is considerably damaged, because of highlights and its pretty soft after this treatment. This is a great price compared to comparable products of this sort.",4
"My Mom used to use this to detangle my long hair when I was tiny (a L-O-N-G time ago).I bought this to de-tangle my Yorkie-Poos' Yorkie-fine but Poodly-curly hair, that had matted slightly under their necks.  It worked GREAT and was less expensive than the pet equivalent detangler.The spray mister worked perfectly on my bottle; no problem with it dispensing properly.  I also like the fact that this isn't too heavily perfumed.  Just a pleasant, fresh scent.  Another favorite Amazon Retro find!",5
"This is a handy alternative to the standard curling iron.  You wrap hair around the heating end with a heat-resistant glove (that fits on either hand), instead of using a clip. One nice feature is the fact that the cord swivels easily where it connects up with the back of the curler, which means it doesn't get tangled like other curlers. The ceramic barrel is designed to protect hair from damage, and it seems to do that better than the more standard steel barrels.It heats up quickly - up to 400 degrees, and there's a temperature control dial to adjust the heat, but it doesn't have specific temperature indicators, so basically you're stuck with ""coolest,"" ""hottest,"" and some random something in between.  Even so, my daughter felt it didn't quite get hot enough.After wrapping hair around the end with a glove you hold it somewhere between 30 seconds and a minute and then it slips off easily.  The absence of a clip means there aren't any ""crimped"" bit in the curls.  The medium-sized curls it creates hold their shape fairly well throughout the day.  The only drawback is the fact that it requires the glove - which means there's something to misplace. I wish there were a clip on the curler that would attach to the glove.",4
It works,5
"Self explanatory really. Mine arrived very well packaged and no marks on it whatsoever. Definitely does the job, although I am new to false lashes, this helps a ton!",5
I use a tab bit all over my face every single night to help prevent wrinkles and it makes my skin glow when I wake up!! NO breakouts either (and I have oily skin too)!! This is a must for great skin! It's a little &#34;sticky&#34; but I use this along with a half tsp of my own homemade essential oil face recipe I make and blends perfectly!,5
"I have tried other Microdermabrasion units and this one works the best by far.  I do suggest you watch the dvd before using the system for best results, and if you've never used one before you most definitely should watch the dvd as suggested so you don't do more harm than good.The system is a big large compared to others I've tried, but compared to the results I'll take the larger size as a positive trade off.I have used the system for a few weeks now and my skin is so much softer, I had not had any sore spots, red streaks or damaged skin...I am quite impressed and excited to see the continued results.Do be careful and don't get too close to your eyes and be sure to pull your skin taught and in the opposite direction that you are moving the tool for best results.  It is also important to change the filter after each use as it collects the dead skin cells, you can't really see them, but would you wash your face with a dirty cloth?I have not had any problems with losing suction or with any other part of the product.",5
"I'm a bath girl.  I'll admit it, right now, to all of you, I am addicted to baths.  I am also addicted to bath stuff.  Anything related to a bath, you will find that I've either tried it or own it.  To me, heaven is a bathtub with some sort of goodness in the water.  Just.Love.It.A friend sent me some Lush goodies a year ago so when I went to visit her in Boston I all but drug her down to Lush to get a fresh supply.  As soon as I got home, in went Big Blue and I started my vacation - again.  There is nothing better - besides the tub - than sitting on the beach, sun warming your skin and feet dipped in the ocean.  This bath bomb brings it all back, including the seaweed to go between your toes!  The smell, the feel, even the color is nothing but the Big Blue.  Added perk of Big Blue was that the seaweed clogged the overflow valve so I got to immerse myself even deeper into the waters!I highly reccomend their ""Ocean Salt"" scrub to complement big blue!",5
"I love these nail gems because their are 12 different colors and shapes to choose from and the containers have clip lids that allow for great storage and non-spills.  If used correctly, they stay on your nails until you take them off, but you must have nail tweezers to apply them.",4
one of my fave CG collections. awesomely bright colors especially when placed over a white base coat. the colors really pop out. shipping was good and packaging was great. no cracks or chips. very happy!,5
Nothing has helped my weak thin nails grow like this stuff. I finally have semi-long nails and they're strong. if I stop using it they start to break again. Love this stuff.,5
"Go to eyeshadow for any eye color. Wet or dry, this eyeshadow glides on smoothly, pigment is beautiful, and its very blendable. 2nd purchase of this eyeshadow from Amazon, both times, arrived in perfect sealed condition. Thanks Amazon!",5
"I rarely need a hair dryer, but when I do its nice to have one that works well. This fits the bill, plus it's attractive and looks nice on my counter top.",5
"When you go to squeeze the product out, the squirted piece pops out and you get a whole bunch of product in your hand that ends up being wasted. It's very frustrating. But I love the cleanser, just won't buy this bottle again.",3
Your choice - sticky and gummy or dirty?  The Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo left my son's hair sticky and gummy. He immediately went to take another shower and wash it out. It does have a nice fragrance and I will be trying this on an elderly gentleman this weekend who is in a nursing home.  I will update my review when I have more to compare it to.,2
"the smell is overwhelming. I put it on at night and it was horrible smelling.It smells exactly like the lipoic acid capsules but alot stronger. that smell did not fade away as i hoped it would and i kept smelling my face ..yucky stinky smelling cream. I did not know it contained this and worse than the smell it stung my face as i had been using a retinol product a few times a week. It also was not very moisturising. It kind of made my face feel dry, not moisturised. I usually use neutrogena light night cream and love how moisturising and gentle it is but wanted to switch to a natural product, but i think just plain olive oil is gonna have to do from now on as i cannot use this stuff. I would not advise using it if you alternativley use any type of retinol or glycolic products, or vitamin c type creams. and definitly stay away from this stuff if you have a sun or wind burn as the lipoic acid ingredient will sting your face.",1
"My hair type: Dark, thick, long, curlyHaving used the worse $20 flat irons and the best $100+ Chi, this is an amazing product without having to break the bank. I use this at about 375 degrees, for my hair type it works the best for a quick, straighten. It does smoke a bit and have a smell but I think that is from using it on a high heat. The hair straightens with first pass (I usually do 2 though). The hair stays straight all day!RECOMMEND!",5
"I really like this shampoo!  I have psoriasis on my scalp and usually use shampoos that dry out my hair quite a bit.  I do have an oily scalp and was afraid that the moisturizing aspect of the shampoo would just make me a greasy mess, I don't usually buy moisturizing shampoo or conditioner (when I buy regular shampoos for when my psoriasis is calm).The shampoo combined with the conditioner would surely make me greasy, right?  Nope!  My hair is soft, nice and shiny.  I wash my hair every other day and didn't have any problems with needing to wash between my regular washings.  I'm happy with this, it made my hair soft but not greasy and kept any flakes at bay.  Definitely good stuff for me and hopefully for you, too!",5
I didn't really have much of an expectation for this product. I bought the set of 3 for fine/medium hair and so far I've only tried the sweet almond mint. 1 time and I'm hooked. I'm in LOVE LOVE LOVE with this product. I took 1 star away because of the amount you need to use and the cost.,4
"I love this giant tub of pins. They are quality hair pins--The plastic coating on the tip of the pins doesn't peel off after one or two uses like some other brands I have tried. Easy to use--no breaking, pulling, or snagging.",5
Definitely made my hair thicker and longer although I saw this product is available at Walmart now so I will probably continue buying it there.,5
"I bought this stuff today at aveda, and I love it. It smells great, and it makes my hair so soft. I use it before I blow dried my hair and it dried super fast, and was really soft and calm after. I usually have a ton of baby hairs sticking up all over the place like I got electrocuted, but this stuff made it go away and made them flatten out! Finally!",5
"I really enjoy this set and like many of the patterns.  For the most part these work really well, stamping clearly, and the plates, while a little thin, are fully backed.I took away a star because a few of the patterns have too much negative space to fill properly and become nearly impossible to use.  But, more than that, the curve at the bottom of the all over patterns as well as their narrow width mean they don't fit on some nails.",4
"I could never find an eyebrow filler that's the right shade for my brows, every one I find is too dark or too light and just looks unnatural, but this one looks very nice and natural and the two colors are very nice and blendable and easy to work with and the wax is nice, helps keep my eyebrows nice and neat, however the brushes they came with are useless, but I already have an old mascara wand (it works just as well as a spoolie brush) I was using to blend my old eyebrow pencil and a good slanted brush so this wasn't really a huge deal, will definitely buy this again when I run out.",4
"Age: 55skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from RosaceaFirst off, the pump bottle is great! I just tried another product (not Olay) that was $60 for this tiny tube and the pump bottle, in a word: sucked like the suckest sucker in suckland. Now here's this Olay product that kicks the ass of the expensive one and doesn't spit expensive product all over my walls, blouse, hair, mirror. yeah.It doesn't take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers. Sometimes expensive is better, and sometimes expensive is just that: more money, not any better results.This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.When I pump a bit of this product (and you don't need a lot!), it has a luminescent look to it, and that I like. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I feel that luminescence will be on my face as well, and it does seem to transfer in that way. I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin, very silky smooth-ahhhhh. I don't care what it has it in, honestly. Just because it feels so good, that's enough for me. It's not expensive, so why not? Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there's a slight fragrance that I enjoy -- it's not heavy, but just adds to my ""mmmmmm"" experience. And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging. It's not greasy, so there's no clogged pores to create blemishes, either.This is one I'll buy.",5
"Really a great lengthening mascara. I have short and sparse lashes that, after applying, looked naturally long and don't droop, even after a few hours. This is a great everyday mascara. I liked that it looked natural, without any thick, clumpy mess. However, it does dry quickly, and if you apply another coat when your previous coats already dried, it won't be pretty.",4
"Very Good brush for the price, feels like a good quality brush, not cheap at all! I will recommend this brush and I will purshase it again. Great for my foundation. great deal!!",5
This is a good sized head. It is styrofoam so sturdiness is questionable depending on where/how you set it. My sister uses this for paper mache masks and other art projects.,5
"The spiking glue is a lot like its name suggests: glue. It really holds your hair in place with very little of the product. It does make your hair feel VERY stiff, so if you don't like that then don't get this product, but if you want to spike your hair go ahead and get this stuff. It does what it says.",5
"I do like these, the only issue that I have is yes, they come in different size BUT only on one side. In the image the ones along the top vary in size big to small, but the second tip on each dotter is the SAME size. So really you are getting 6 sizes, not 10.",4
"Whoever said you can't tell a book by its cover hadn't seen the container Lagerfeld designed for this fragrance - its as lovely as the scent it holds.Adding to his popular fragrance, Chloe&quot; and his standby men's scent, &quot;Lagerfeld,&quot; Karl Lagerfeld introduced Sun Moon Stars in, I believe, 1994.While, to my knowledge it has not enjoyed the customer base that Chloe does, it is, nonetheless, an outstanding scent. It's an attractive blend of oriental and floral notes.True to his designer roots Lagerfeld presents it in a stunning bottle - a midnight blue frosted glass orb rimmed by motifs of the sun, moon, and stars.",4
I purchased the Jet Bonnet Dryer Attachment because I am interested in hair care. I did not like using the regular hooded hair dryer because it kept me stationary. With the Bonnet hair dryer I can have mobility to do the things I want to when under the dryer. It great when treating and deep conditioning my hair and I have the flexibility to use it at whatever temperature I want it. It's lightweight and so amazingly easy to store that I have put away my hooded hair dryer for good and I only use this now. I love it.,5
"This product has a nice ergonomic feel and has a good long chord,( no batteries), There is a decent number of attachments(8) brush and scissor.The set also includes the standard lubricant and stainless steel scissors,made in china.The quality of the haircutter itself is really nice.The quiet hum is a good thing,as my Whal,which was not as quiet.I am into the buzz cut,and this allows me to do it myself.The industrial style plastic box houses the cutter and it'It has a slight bend,and fits nicely in the hand. (It also has a bib to use with your subject.The absence of ear guards is an issue for me and the fact you have to use an outlet.All in all it is a good cutter for general haircut use.I aso use it to have my back trimmed,but without the finest trimmer I have to use it bare on the back.It says it lasts a life time,we shall see.I would have liked a finer close up trimmer for my back.",4
"This stuff makes my puppy lick my eyeballs.But other than that, its a good product!  Very nice to use and clean rinsing.",5
"This product in my opinion is good for many things.  I use on face sometimes to help heal blemishes.  Also very useful for flaky scalp, dandruff.  Put some on fingertips and massage Into scalp before bed.  Wash out on morning and scalp will thank you.  It does make hair appear shiny and feel soft also.  Extra plus.Yes it smells.  Mixture of garlic and peanut butter? I don't know. Still trying to decide.  Not the best smelling I agree but its usefulness outweighs the odor.",5
"I love this, it stays on and washes off really well. Very impressed. I do not have to purchase really expensive mascara anymore.",5
It was okay i assume. it glued well i just wish i had gotten the clear one instead of the dark.,3
It is Ok don't know about the hair growth part but it does loosens up your braids so it semi works,3
"I am not the kind of person who always puts products in my hair. But this winter has been extremely bad with making my hair feel dry and lifeless. Not to mention all the static. No any more. While this leave in is a little on the watery side, it seems to make up for it in other areas. After using my hair is extremely soft. It never has extra residue, nor does it leave my hair feeling stiff or greasy. This is my new go to when my hair needs a quick pick me up.",5
That's about it really... I didn't see a significant decrease in my acne when using this product. I needed a more aggressive scrub.,2
"the light works fine. The bulbs and everything came packaged nicely and wasn't broken. I had to play around with the bulbs once I put them in because they had to be place just right in the socket. Other than then that, it works fine, except that it's only one hand placement and it takes longer.",4
"Let me say up front, the list of ingredients on this product frightened me. I almost didn't use it, but after some research, I discovered that they weren't likely to blind me if I did (at least, not if I used the product in small quantities). And I'm pleased to say the worst that happened for me was a bit of itchiness and redness a few times.Also, I should mention that I don't have inadequate lashes. My lashes were on the short side, but couldn't be called stubby, and they weren't as lush as I'd liked, but couldn't be called thin either. Basically, my lashes would probably be classified as average. However, I did have a problem with my lashes easily coming out if pulled on (say, when removing eye-crusties or dander, &c.;).I made sure to read the directions on the packaging--apply to the areas in which you'd like to see growth and thickening (eyebrows, top, and bottom lashes) each night before bed; in my case: top eyelashes--and do exactly as they specified for a full 8 weeks (two weeks longer than indicated) before writing my review. Here's the 8 week play by play:Weeks 1-3: Absolutely nothing discernible happened to my lashes.Week 3-4: I noticed some length, but no thickening of my lashes.Week 5-6: Still no thickening, but my lashes grew enough to be noticeable by others and the growth was very noticeable when I put on my mascara.Weeks 6-7: There is a bit of thickening, and only a little bit more length (hardly noticeable).Week 7-8: Growth seems to have tapered off.When all is said and done? The product works, however, I don't have Adriana Lima's eyelashes (or anything close). To offer numbers, I'd estimate the growth at about 25% and the thickening at less than 5%. One thing I did appreciate was that it strengthened my lashes--they no longer pull out easily if I try to remove something from them. In fact, I can tug pretty good and they'll stay put. As far as the growth is concerned, I've received similar effects by using a 2-step conditioning mascara for a few months.Since I've never used a prescription eyelash serum, I can't do a proper comparison, but I'd be hard-pressed to believe these are the *same* (or similar) results one would get. It might give a nice boost to women with average or slightly below average lashes, but as I mentioned before, similar results might be possible with a good 2-step conditioning mascara used daily for a few months. That said, if you're impatient (results in 2 months as opposed to 3+), or don't like to wear mascara, or need the strengthening on top of length, this is a viable alternative.Finally, when I stopped using the mascara, my lashes returned to their shorter status after a few weeks, and I'm worried that the same will happen when I stop using the EnvyDerm, so I'll update this review about a month after I've stopped using the product. (Using it only on my top lashes, after 8 weeks, I'd guess that I still have a few weeks left.)",4
"I love to use this at home during the day or for when I have to make a quick trip to the grocery store. It's also perfect for what I refer to as my &#34;lazy-days&#34; when I don't feel like getting ready for class, so I just jump out of bed, slather this on, and be on my merry way to hell.",4
"My adventures in comparing salt(s) from the San Francisco Salt Company continue.  I owe the opportunity to do so to the company's current marketing initiative but my only obligation/compensation for my efforts is a set of samples of their products and the promise to write a fair review for potential customers.I'm comparing their scented Epsom salt product with this genuine Minera  Dead Sea Salt soak (unscented.)  As a popular Amazon reviewer has pointed out, Dead Sea Salts have a more complex composition than Epsom salts, which are magnesium tetra hydrate (for the vast part).  Your skin is exposed to more minerals with the Dead Sea product ...but you don't get the 'aroma-therapy' that comes with my peppermint/eucalyptus extract sample.  Both products are attractively packaged and the crystals are clean and wholesome.  Both products dissolve well but not instantly in bath-temperature water.  Both products somehow make my water 'softer' or better able to clean my skin...and I tested that without using soap.  The Dead Sea salts did an amazing job of helping to exfoliate my skin...in comparison to the Epsom-based soak.  I did not expect to see such a difference.  This is a top-class product.For therapeutic purposes, a soak will require about twelve gallons of water and about a pound of these salts and it will take at least twelve minutes of your time.  Well...we are in the tub to rest and relax!  Comfortably hot water at a depth that you can sink down into and get skin coverage is also, obviously, important.  As with other reviewers, I found this mix in this concentration will provide some useful 'drawing' action to ease skin irritation from insect bites (in my case, chiggers).  Thankfully, I haven't had to test this on poison ivy or nettles!From now on, this will be my bath salt of choice.  I note it is also available in scented form.  I enjoyed the peppermint/eucalyptus scent in the Epsom product offered by this company but I look forward to also getting the lavender infused Minera salts for a relaxing, exfoliating soak.",5
I love the smell of this product its wonderful. The consistency of this product is thick and should be used sparingly. I didnt know how to use this product so maybe thats why I didnt get the results that I was looking for. I have since then done more research and am confident that I can get what I need out of this product. Im almost 3 months natural and my hair is really growing fast. I cant wait to try this on a twist out.,3
"Light works as it's supposed to.  I would have given it 5 stars, however I bought an LED light bc I read that it reduces curing time.  However I still did 2 min. each step so it didn't save any time at all.  The nice thing is not having to replace bulbs.At first I thought this light was broken.  I used it for the first time along with the Gelish Basix Kit I  and Gelish Polish that I bought at the same time.My nails were not curing very well even when I tried 4 min under the light!  My nails smudged and didn't look very good at all.The second day, I tried again.  This time I placed my polishes in a warm bowl of water to thin them out.  It did help with the consistency.  If the polish is too thick it won't cure as well.  The polish dried a little better but still not happy.For my daughters nails, I used a different brand and color of polish and it worked perfectly!With this light, I did 2 min. each step.  The polish will remain slightly tacky between coats.  Don't worry about this.  Don't even touch them to see how dry  or hard they are. Just keep going through the steps.  After you put the Top coat on and cure it, you will take the cleanser with lent free pad and wipe off the tacky residue.  Nails will not smuge and they will look beautiful.For the price of this light compared to others, this was a good deal.  I only wish it cured faster.",4
"First I purchased a very similar item but that did not have the on and off switch up front. I am glad that I returned that and ordered this instead. Also, the rollers are great but I dont use the clips hot rather cold eliminating the clipmarks...",5
"Maybe it's because I have no hair roller experience at all, but seriously they are so difficult to use! I haven't gotten decent looking curls once since I bought them a good while ago.",3
"This emu oil is the best form of moisturiser I've ever used. I originally bought this to help reduce appearance of stretch marks. So far, it hasn't really helped but in its defense I havent been using it religiously for very long! This works wonders on my dry hair (apply when wet and use very little) as well as my dry skin. If you use too much it looks super oily, so just remember less is more! It also supposedly helps with joint and muscle pain, which I have never tried using it for.. Sorry! It also is supposed to thicken hair so I have been using it on my eyelashes in replace of Careprost. Emu oil works so well at so many different issues, give it a try!",5
Red hair is hard to keep up.  This helps.  I can't find it in stores anymore.  Thank goodness I could find it on line.,4
"Not as strong as I hoped, but it is still a good basic retinol face cream. There is no irritation and my skin is nicely moisturized but not oily..",4
"This bath oil has a nice, not overwhelming scent, and it leaves my skin feeling moist after a warm soak.  Although I tend to prefer bath salts (I don't know why -- it's just a thing with me), this oil is better at moisturizing.  It doesn't leave a greasy film on my skin, either, something I'm always concerned about with bath oil.  This product retails (at this writing) for a price far less than similar premium products, making it an economical choice for someone who uses a lot.This bath oil would be nice paired with other Aqua Spa products as a Mother's Day, birthday, or holiday gift.  Note:  I received a sample for review.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5
This is a great polish. It is made by Zoya so it is already fabulous. I put to coats on and they looked good but I wanted the color a little darker. I did another one and then applied Sally Hansen fast dry that is in the red bottle. This helps keep your polish on longer and your nails dry fast.,4
"I love this color for summer... it's bright and cheerful, and Orly always stays on my toes for a couple weeks before it starts chipping.  Great purchase!",5
"I couldn't give this more than 3 stars, because it only worked well right after I got my spiral perm.  My hair is only naturally wavy, so when the perm began to relax, the product did not enhance or support curls.  I don't like products that are stiff, but this is simply too weak, with little control and less holding power.  But if you have naturally, very curl hair, or your hair is fresh off the perm rods, this is good cream.  Stops frizzing and lightly texturizes.",3
"As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this product for review.  The lathering scrub is reasonably priced and works well.  I have been alternating back and forth with the regular body wash.  The gritty feeling texture opens up the pores.  I recommend this product and would purchase it.",4
"I love this little tube of sunscreen, even though you don't get much of it for the price, and the SPF is only 15.Since it feels so good going on and provides subtle hints of illumination, I like to use this one for my face, forearms, shoulders and chest. For the larger areas of my body, I just grab a large cheap tub of No-Ad or Banana Boat.This Ponds product goes on clear and soaks right on, leaving a soft, dewy sheen. The scent is mild and soft; it's vaguely tropical in a soft way. Lightly floral, instead of fruity.The coverage is for both UVA and UVB applications, and contains avobenzone, ensulizole and octisalate.I haven't noticed this product running into my eyes when I wear it on my face and go for a run.RECOMMENDATION: This small tube (1.7 oz) and light SPF (15) isn't really made for a day at the beach. You'd use up a tube on one person in one day, over the course of reapplying enough to cover your exposed body. I don't think the product is sold with that kind of thing in mind.As a light protection for the face and neck, the Pond's product is great. It fits well in my purse and I like the way it feels on my face. The luminous hints add a touch of makeup to a fresh-faced look. For this kind of use, it's a five star sun lotion.",5
"I have very fine, flat hair and this is the reason I wanted to try this particular product. I have done several hair washes so I could get an idea if the product really worked and I am happy to say it does.  It did give my hair a bit more volume and I am satisfied with that.  I wasn't expecting a miracle and did not get one.  It worked well enough for me to continue using it because my hair can use any help it can get.",5
"I always use face washes, instead of soap, in the shower. This Biore product comes out as a cool gel with a few micro-beads, you are supposed to rub it into your skin and make it lather to get the steam to activate the cleaning power. My face felt clean and fresh, but not tight after using this. I like this cleanser and will continue to use it.",5
"I am giving this 4 stars only because the Philosophy Miracle Worker is a good send. But because of the retinal in the Miracle Worker I found switching back and forward between the too options (about every 2 - 3 months), allows my skin to not grow accustom to treatment, saves some money and still maintains my under eyes. I use this in the morning and before bed because gradually it will lift and brighten your under eyes. Oh, and the price was great which is why I scooped it up on Amazon.com",4
"Works as described. Love the nice clean scent and oil yumminess, but would love more nutrients...It arrived as promised. Would order again. ++++ Thank you!",4
"My daughter is 17 now. She was attacked by a dog when she was 7 yrs old & has several small scars on her face. We discovered this magical concealer at JC Pennys one day & they are way over-priced! So I bought it on here for a much better affordable price & my daughter uses it every day. Even though she's gorgeous without it! It also last a long time! Just a little dab of this concealer works AMAZING!! Arrived VERY quick, packaged very safe, price is unbeatable & I HIGHLY recommend this if you want to cover ANY kind of blemish, freckles, scars....it's a wonderful product for sure!!!! & It lasts a long time!",5
"Okay overall I love the feel of the blow dryer in my hand, the handle is awesome.  I like the three speeds, the hot, warm and cool.  I like the cool burst.  I like the ion equalizer.  The diffuser works well.  The back pops off easily for cleaning.  My hair looked great when I was done.  One time when I had my hair flipped over and was blow drying upside down my hair got sucked into the back of the dryer through the vent.  I panicked since I was getting married in a week and my hair actually had to be cut off.  Sad thing is the hair got sucked in twice more.  Otherwise great dryer, just be wary of the rear vent.",4
A little bit thick. I only use one drop and blend into my moisturizer. Seems like its too much for my skin and seems like it does more to clog rather than clear,2
"These are wonderful to get your face scrub clean morning/evening.  Itmakes your skin feel clean and fresh.  I was not able to locate any inmy small town.  So, I went to the best source in town...Amazon.  It arrivedless than a week from the time I ordered it.  So, the product is fabulous;the Seller is wonderful!!",5
"I bought this to use as &#34;foundation&#34; for going to the pool in Mexico. I have to say this coupled with theBALMs Hot Mama blush and a little bronzer is awesome. Has sunscreen in it, evens skin tone just enough, and moisturizes. Will be my forever beach make up!",4
"This type of iron is hard to find in stores. Glad I found it at Amazon.I have no big gripes about this iron, except that it needs improvement on thewarm up time (takes about 10 minutes to get hot). My hair is fairly short and fine,and the 1-1/2"" barrel gives it enough body, without curls.",4
This butter is perfect for my skin. I have Sjogrin's Syndrome and my body is dry. The buter is great for moisture and it doesn't stain my clothing.,5
"STRONG SMELLING!!!  Not a bad smell, but it's strong.  The lube is great, glide is great, and there is no residue left over.  Nice.  Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?",4
This stuff worked great. After the very first use I noticed the strength and moisture it added to my hair.,5
These rollers work so good.  I use them on my 7 year old and it makes her hair perfect spirals and she can sleep in them with no problems.  I would love to find thicker ones and another package as she has very thick hair!,5
"I've used a lot of different depilatory methods and this is one of the stranger ones.  First, it doesn't come with any instructions so you have to either play with it until you figure it out, or go look it up on the internet.  I did both because intuitive it isn't.When I finally figured out how to work with it -- and I really recommend you check out this video on YouTube: Hair Removal - Tried and Tested: EP9 for a good overview of how it works -- I found that it HURT!  Yes, I know pulling hair out of your body does hurt but I have waxed and plucked and it was nothing like this.  It also doesn't actually remove all the hair it tugs on, so you might be forced to use it several times in the same spot before you manage to de-fuzz.So, painful, and only somewhat useful?  Meh, I don't think I'll be throwing out my tweezers any time soon.",3
"I got three shades of magnetic polish for my teenage daughter because she loves painting her nails. I was intrigued by it and generally don't wear nail polish but decided to try the Silver Elements.Following the instructions was easy. The first thin coat was sheer enough that I wondered how well it would work, it dried very quickly. Applying the second thick coat to one nail at a time then using the magnet on it took a little more time. The overcap with the magnet has a lip to sit under the cuticle with the magnet over the nail bed.It was so neat seeing the design appear. Holding the magnet for a bit longer than a ten count created a more interesting and vivid effect. The polish is holding up fine so far and I'm pretty hard on my nails.I may get some more just for myself. This is a lot of fun. My daughter likes it a lot too.",4
I like this product because of the stencil.  I do not know how to shape my eyebrows and the stencils makes it easier for me to have perfectly shaped eyebrows.  The colors are nice too.  I am Asian and have black hair.  I like the shade and choose the lightest one because it looks more natural.,3
"I've used this hair spray for years now! I've tried various different &#34;strong hold&#34; hairsprays, but none have lived up to the task like TIGI Bed head Hard Head Hair Spray! YOur hair will definitely feel a little crunchy afterwards, but nothing a brush can't smooth out.",5
"I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping. However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling. Switched to Nailtiques #2 and it helped them recover.",2
"I buy this regularly - a better deal when bought in this quantity.  Some lotions have caused me skin problems, but never this one. Seems to be perfect for me - a &#34;light&#34; lotion that I use every day all year long. No more flakey skin!!!",5
I like this product line from Loreal. I hadn't tried it before and this is a good daytime moisturizer. I don't have to use a lot of product for coverage either which makes it last longer!,4
never worked from day one. has no power when put to the nail... stops immediately. and its not like I was using it professionally but just for home use and I never got to really use it because it wouldn't even work well!,1
"Magnetic nail polishes are so much fun, to begin with. And these colors are absolutely gorgeous! What a fun way to spice up plain ole' nail polish! Great deal, and product.",5
"I have no idea why so many people dislike this product because I love it! I have tried Suave and store-bought brand, and this dry shampoo definitely knocks the other two out of the ballpark. You have to shake it pretty well before use, but besides that, it covers up all the grease and makes your hair look like it is freshly washed. The only complaint I have is that it is pretty easy to burn through the whole bottle quickly, and if done incorrectly, your hair will look white/gray, but that is really the personal user's issue. I recommend this product to everyone. Also, I have thin, wavy, oily hair and I wash my hair every other day with this product.",5
"The Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo (28 oz) is a joy to use and a money saver. Only a small amount of shampoo is necessary for a soft rich easy lather that made my hair shine and feel softer. The Moroccan argan lightweight miracle oil in the Suave's shampoo seem to work as it was absorbed instantly, provided a gentle cleansing and gave my hair a lasting shine. The instructions recommend also using Suave's Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner. I was pleased with the results of both of them.",5
Great size and great price. Leaves skin soft and not dry. My boyfriend has oily skin and i have normal skin and it works for both of us.,5
"Cute & easy to cute. To me they aren't good enough for the serious type of nail artists. But if you like fun, cool & whimsical designs, these are for you.",5
"I think this product does have a beneficial effect on the skin around the eyes, but need to use it longer to know whether overall it deserves five stars.",4
"I bought these for my 17 year old sister for Christmas along with the NYX eyeshadow base, which makes the colors oh so very vivid. She loved them, and so do I. In fact, I may end up buying some for myself!",5
"I have used the Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo and love the smell. The Shampoo has a bit of a detangler to it, so my hair does not tangle, even if I skimp on the conditioner. In order to keep curls from being frizzy, I need to use some product, so my hair is often dry. Also, I have very fine hair, in spite of the curls, so my hair frizzes much easier than someone with thicker locks. It is terrible in the summer. Regardless, I need something with a high amount of moisturizer or my hair is just disgusting.  The shampoo is a good start, but I didn't like the matching conditioner as much.",5
some of the best wispies on the market. natural and flirty.,5
"I use this in the mornings after the Now Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I'm in my 30s and trying to combat forehead wrinkles.  I like how this product is lightweight and absorbs well.  I also like how its ingredients aren't scary.  Lately though I've been moisturizing with Jojoba oil or Grapeseed oil before I get out of the shower and this really seems to help the moist.  Considering so many moisturizers feel greasy and/or are loaded with toxins, I'm happy with this product and will consider reordering when it runs out.  (That's another thing - you do get a lot, or at least you don't need to use a lot - mine has lasted a few months already using it every morning on face, neck and chest.)",4
"love it, it works great on acen prone skin to keep the oil away. it smells very good! i can only use it once a day, otherwise, my skin gets too dry.",5
My biggest concern when trying this product is that it would leave my extremely sensitive skin very red and enflamed afterwards. I was surprised after the first use of this product. My skin was polished and silky! I was delighted by the results. Any dead or dry skin was buffed off and my skin looked luminous. My only negative comment is that I had to quickly apply a moisturizer as it left my skin tight.I couldn't be happier with the end result of this product however and I will continue to use it as part of my daily facial program.,5
"I wouldn't know about the tropical: I'm not that good at figuring out scents, but trust me when I tell you that this isn't all that fruity, which is actually good. It doesn't have a strong scent. Awesome.I have tried oh-so-many different dry shampoo brands, and this one is by far the absolute best one. It's very powdery, so if you don't like that &#8212; maybe it's not for you. I love it, because that really sucks in all of the greasiness from my hair. It doesn't leave it looking too matte, as in dry and lifeless looking, because it's not just any powder, like using baby powder. It really helps your hair.I wish I had a box of these, so I wouldn't have to repurchase it again and again.Do yourself a favor and get more than one. You won't be sorry. And hey, if you're sorry, let me know &#8212; I'll come and get the rest from you ;)",5
"Tresemme Keratin Smooting Serum worked great on my hair.  I have thin hair but a lot of it.  My hair has a tendency to be dry from over heating it with curling irons and hair dryers and I wanted something to smooth it out without the weight.  Often mousse doesn&#8217;t do what I want it too and smoothing products leave it too heavy and greasy feeling.  This product did not do that, it was light and controlled the fly away hairs.  I did not use Tresemme&#8217;s shampoo and conditioner while using this product-but loved using this before drying my hair.  Sometimes I dry it in the evening and style in the morning and the product still works without any greasy feeling in the morning!  I must say, a great product!",5
"but tends to leave a bit of a heavy feel if too much is used. plus its a small bottle, goes quick. i think that my fine curly hair is too picky for this mild product, but its still a good product for different hair, like baby hair or the like.",4
"I've only used mine a few times now but they work great! The manufacturer needs to work on their shipping containers as mine arrived poking through and almost bent. All of mine had punctured through the plastic envelope type thing that they are sold in, and almost through the manilla envelope that they had been shipped in. In all I would say that is my only complaint!",4
"I like this product as it goes on light, absorbs fairly quickly, and doesn't smell.  It lasts a long time.",4
"This product was exactly what I wanted: it came very quickly and is look very holographic. I honestly don't like how it looks on all my nails, so right now i am using it as a feature nail for one of my designs, but I still really like it. I would recommend this polish to anyone who like feature nails or designs.",5
i choose this rating because these dotting tools are awesome. I would recommend this product to anybody. love this product,5
I love this stuff. I'm now on my 2nd bottle & use it all the time.My nails are noticeably stronger & longer.Works great as a base coat as well.,5
"This may be a great product, I don't think it is right for me.  It feels sticky on my face and I don't like the feel.  I always had to put another cream over this.  I did try to use it for at least a week, but I couldn't get past the feeling.",2
"I recently bought the dispenser for my 5 year old who loves it.  This system encourages him to wash his hands more!  This scent is light, clean, and fresh.  It is not overpowering at all and is not drying to the hands.  ++++ for Lysol!",5
"I read a bunch of reviews for brushes and was having a hard time - I eventually settled on this brush because of the price and the talk about bristles adding shine to your hair. The brush is very gentle on hair (I have naturally wavy/curly hair which I color and blow out regularly, mid/long length, thin hair but a lot of it), does not seem to break my hair like other brushes, and I have noticed an improvement in shine. So far none of the bristles/pins have fallen out or bent. I have not used this brush to actually blow out my hair, but I would be interested to try other brushes from this line (round) for that purpose.",5
"I read every single review on this product and decided I had to try it. I really don't know of anything else like it on the market. It definitely adds volume. And continues to boost volume even overnight. My problem is that it provides volume near the roots but the rest of my shoulder length hair becomes very static-ey. I have an early morning meeting once a week and I hate to get up to wash my hair, so I have used this stuff to fluff up my hair in the morning so I can wash it the night before. So that is good. It does feel sticky and I have not really been able to make the style last for too long. Still, I think it is a very interesting product. I am sure it works great for shorter styles. Overall, I think it is worth trying.",4
"This moisturizer is a miracle...in gel form. I am in my late 20s and still have combo skin of a teenage girl and still get the occasional breakout along my chin. I used to use products with salicylic acid because that product is sold as something that is supposed to cure, prevent, or lessen breakouts. After using products with that ingredient for years and not seeing a reduction in my breakouts (they were never really bad...more annoying than anything), I decided that maybe I should try something w/out that ingredient that could hopefully control my oily t-zone yet moisturize the rest of my face.THIS MOISTURIZING GEL IS THE WINNER!The gel formula provides just enough moisture to those dry spots but not so much that the oily spots look like an oil slick by the end of the day. I have used it in humid climates and dry climates and it works great in both. There are a few times a year that I will use a normal moisturizer if my skin is feeling extra dry (typically during the winter months). I also really like how soft it makes you skin. It almost leaves my skin feeling like it has a primer on it...and it does seem to make my foundation go on smoother.You will thank Clinique after you use this moisturizer on your combo skin and see the amazing results it produces!",5
Such an affordable price for a lovely little kit. Love these colors for everyday looks and even for smoky night out looks. Happily grateful. :-),5
"I've been using Neutrogena glycerine soap since I was a teenager in the 1970s.  I really like the soap and its fragrance, and it leaves my face feeing clean and fresh.  Unfortunately, this product is no longer available for subscription order.",5
"This Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Shampoo has a great scent; very pleasant while not overpowering. The consistency washes thoroughly and rinses cleanly. The anti-breakage formula they use is intended to strengthen hair, and after several uses, it appears to be effective.",5
I have to hit the eyeshadow with the end of my brush to loosen it up a bit. It doesn't stay on very long and I just wasn't happy with it. It might work for everyone else though!,2
i have acrylic and nail polish and it takes a while to work...i guess i have to soak my fingers in it for a coiple minutes because i had to go to the salon to use a drill to remove what it couldnt,4
"This is my first weave so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but this seems like decent weave hair. Its not amazing, but its good quality for the price I think. It holds a curl well, its not too fine or shiny but perhaps a little bit too much for my own (damaged) hair. I've only had mine for three weeks now, but it seems like if you take care of it and maintain it with the right products it can turn out beautifully.",4
"I felt guilty for giving this iron a bad review previously, so am back to edit now.  I previously said that I'd used this iron for 2 weeks and thought it weighed my hair down.  I've now used it for a few more weeks and I think what was weighing my hair down was the tresseme heat protector spray.  I only wash my hair every 3rd day, so I kept using that spray every day I ironed my hair.  I suppose that probably isn't necessary (?) Now, I spray once, well, the 1st day, and then on the following days, I do not spray near the roots at all, but just a little on the ends and my hair is not weighed down as much.  It wasn't this iron's fault!  So I feel bad for saying it was ;(  Anyway, this iron heats up very quickly and beeps to let you know when it's ready.  Also, you can lock the temperature in by just pressing the minus key and holding it down.  Some more expensive irons don't have this feature and the temperature or power buttons are easy to hit when just trying to hold the iron.  The lowest setting is 300 degrees and I've found that even this temperature can straighten my hair and then i don't risk as much damage.  But, I've had some help straightening it too.  I had a Brazilian Blowout 4 months ago, and I do straighten it as a blow-dry it too.I've been using this iron daily for 2 weeks now. I think the blowout may have worn out by now though!?  About.com says that the plates of this flatiron have a porous ceramic coating that actually emits a silicon-based conditioner and that the liquid inside it lasts about 4 years.  I wonder why they don't put that on the outside of the box somewhere, or in the user manual inside the box?  I wonder if maybe they want customers to think the conditioning properties could last 4-ever?  Regardless of it being a good iron for the money, I've already ordered a different iron from amazon.com: BaByliss Pro BABNT3073T Nano Titanium Straightening Iron, only because the length of the plates on this one are so short, that I can't get a good-sized chunk of hair in it without pieces falling off the ends of the plate.  I'm thinking I could possibly save time ironing my hair if I were able to straighten larger chunks of hair at a time!  As for drugstore irons though (I got mine at Target) - I'd say this is about the best one for the money that you're going to find.",3
"I wasn't sure on this color but took the risk based on the reviews.  It is super light pink, but looks great on.  I am medium complexion with brown hair, hazel eyes.  This color was great.  Just a little dab to brighten the lips!",5
"Most of the images are for full nail coverage, but many have such small intricate designs & you have to file your stamper with a nail file to make it grab the images. The use of an XL stamper, also works better to pick up the tiny details. I recomend using special stamping polishes for the plates, but you can experiment with other polishes, to see what works for you. It can be very frustrating to get some of the images to work.",3
"just what I was looking for. 1 coat is enough to still see your nails but have a wonderful gel like milky white with a hint of pink layer. no streaking whatsoever, coverage is nice and even. absolutely gorgeous with zoya top coat (armor) on top-extremely shiny. very classy! would work for any occasionzoya's description : cream, 1 (from 1 to 5 ; 5 being the most opaque and 1 the most sheer)",5
"This complete set is cheeap Evertyhing , too much talcom in the shadows The mascara was clumpy and barely there and the eye pencil was too dry to put on my eyes.  wont buy this again",2
I use this when conditioning my hair along with the Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner. It smells amazing and is very moisturizing. It arrived in great condition.,5
"Okay, I will start off by saying that I'm probably not the best person to ask about makeup, since I hardly ever wear it. This is probably about the third foundation I have ever bought in my lifetime. Now with that aside, I do like it. It's a kind of runny consistency which I think made it easy to rub into my skin (I use my hands). It feels pretty good, as in I don't feel like my pores are being clogged up or anything. My only complaint is that I got the Ivory 100, which is the lightest shade (I believe), and it's still a shade or so too dark for me. I'm very pale. But, I was able to get it to blend in pretty nicely and I think it looks okay. Like I said I don't know that much about makeup, but I am pleased with this and will probably buy it again if I ever run out.",4
"Did nothing for my skin. My facial skin is without acne, or dark spots. It really didn't do anything for me. As far as I was concerned to was just a weird looking cleansing sponge. It didn't even feel that great. I felt it was a waste of my money.",1
I love the way this makes my hair feel and smell. I was put on to Monoi oil by Carol's Daughter but I was frightened by that $30 price for only a 2oz bottle. I decided to give this one a try considering the huge difference in price and size. I am very pleased with my purchase.,4
I use this hair brush everyday. It does a pretty good job at detangling my hair. Would recommend to friend.,5
"I bought this cleanser last year for occasional use to remove makeup when getting home after a night out. I completely missed that it contains microbeads, which meant I couldn't use it on my eyes. (Some people do, I just prefer not to.) It hung around for a few months with me occasionally using it and forgetting about it again, before I dug it out and used it for my everyday cleanser in the shower. For the first few days, I was pleased. Nice cleansing, rinsed well, nice smell, and you didn't have to use a lot.But on the third day I noticed what looked like a strange blemish on my cheek. I didn't connect it with this cleanser until I started alternating this with two other cleansers in the shower (some of the more popular skin care blogs suggest not using the same cleanser every day). This blemish was actually a small really rough, sore patch of skin, and it would improve, then come back. I took the Olay out of my routine all together, and it went away. Brought the cleanser back into my routine thinking once or twice a week would be fine and the spot came back, as did a second one on another part of my face.I really think the beads plus salicylic acid is just too much for my skin, and it might be for yours, too. This is honestly the only problem I've ever had with an Olay product, but ultimately, I just can't recommend this.",3
I have very dry skin this leaves my skin feeling silky smooth...you will not be disappointed,5
"I live in a really hot, humid environment.  I bought a liquid thinking it would be better than lotions, but it left a terrible shiny film behind.  Maybe if you live somewhere arid and have dry skin this would work.  If you are acne-prone and live in a humid environment, I would pass over this sunblock.",2
"As someone who has struggled with puffiness under my eyes and fine lines around the outer edges of my eyes, I was looking for something that could help boost my self-confidence.  In pictures, and from far away I looked good, but anytime I saw a close up of myself or looked closely in the mirror, I felt defeated. I was tired of looking like I was older than I was. Countless products had failed to do anything for me.  I noticed slight improvements with some cheap products like Garnier and Olay, but my skin quickly adapted and they didn't work for long.  I decided to give this one a try.  I am really pleased so far.  Don't expect anything to work overnight, but with a little patience and time, you will start noticing results.The puffiness under my eyes has gone done significantly, while the fine lines seem to have faded into the background. It took a little bit of time.  I noticed the improvement in puffiness in a few weeks and the fine lines took a little longer.  I stuck it out though, and I'm glad I did because this product did what no other product has been able to do for me. Some of the others felt heavy and caked on or didn't absorb well, but that wasn't the case with the Elite Serum Rx. It was light and left my skin feeling nice and smooth immediately after applying. For those who want to feel youthful and radiant, I highly recommend purchasing this product.",5
"Clear scalp is the best shampoo I have used in years. I love the idea that it has the vitamin E and Shea butter in it and  infuse the hair with moisturizer and clean the the skill as it moisturizes and clean the hair at the end of the day. This product is good, I like I'm going to buy some more of this product and keep it on  my self as I run out. The price is just right.",5
"This conditioner has a light creamy texture with a very mild scent. I tried the matching Nexxus shampoo at the same time and noticed the fragrance was slightly different but still vaguely citrusy. I mention this to be thorough, but it really isn't an issue because, unlike many other oppressively scented personal care products, both items have such a mild fragrance it dissipates quickly and simply isn't a problem.I have shoulder-length, thin textured hair and conditioner is always a difficult purchase because if it is rich enough to detangle my hair, it also weighs it down so it looks flat and greasy. But with this conditioner, after blow drying my hair I noticed it felt incredibly soft - much softer than usual - and my fly away and somewhat frizzy sections were much less so.I used such a small amount of the product, probably a dime-sized dollop, that the bottle will last a long time,  I like this conditioner very much and will continue to use it.",5
I had heard from a friend that this perfume smelled nice so I bought it on a whim to see for myself.  I am not a huge fan of all these random celebrities coming out with perfumes that all start to smell the same.  This one is a total exception!  It smells so sexy and classy at the same time.  It lasts all day long and smells very expensive.  I am in love with it.  The bottle is very unique as well.,5
"Great for making designs on your nails, they work much better than toothpicks!Only this is, there are NOT 10 different sizes as advertised. There are 5 pens but each one of them have a same size tip on one side, so there are actually only 5 different sizes.I don't feel like it is a big problem because there are enough size differences among the 5 sizes for use. I really like the size of the &#34;repeated size&#34; as well so I don't mind having those extra tips since I use them most often. Nice product for a great price!",4
"I must start by saying that this item was bought as a gift for my granddaughter who is a &#34;Hunger Game&#34; fan and have therfore, not used any of the polish.  I know that my nail salon uses China Glaze polish, so I'm presuming that these will be good.  I just the idea of one for each of the districts!",4
best stuff ever and I have tried quite the gamet of self tanners. I love that it doesn't smell bad and u get color right away. Best stuff yet...,5
Bought this on the recommendation of my daughter who was a stylist. Makes my hair look and feel softer with less damage from hair dryer or iron. Spray it on wet hair.,5
I'm so glad I tried this I usally get mac but hey I gave another makeup product a chance and it matches my skin tone I will be buying more of this,5
"Good to have in your purse for a touch up but it runs out to quickly for me to want to use it as my go to blush the color was soft enough though.I use Loreal's True match pressed powder on the daily, so i guess i was just expecting the same quality.",3
"Yup, it's amazing. Beautiful selection. Highly pigmented. Looks great all day.I love it. Everyone else loves it. You will love it too.",5
"I actually got this for free when I stayed at a hotel. It was a small sample pack. I'm so glad I discovered this. Definitely one of the best lotions out there. It makes your skin have this shine to it, WITHOUT you looking actually shiny. Just the right balance. My skin looked dewy. It smells nice too. I will always continue to buy this.",5
"Detailer, striper, oh my! Use these brushes with acrylic paint if drawing designs. (if u mess up you can wash acrylic off with warm water and nail polish base wont come off!). The brushes have this plastic over them so it wont bend during shipping as well :). Recommended for people who like to hand draw their nail art or would like to practice!",5
I used to use this as a teenager but for some reason stopped. I've been using covergirl foundation over olay face cream for years but for some reason my face started breaking out recently. So I bought a bottle of this and my face cleared right up and I don't even need the olay cream because this cold cream moisturizes my face plenty,5
this is my fifth fragrance from PH and I think it is my favorite.. long lasting fresh sexy...value for money,5
"I love pumpkin anything.  I had previously used the fruit fiesta peel and really liked it.  When I heard this was a bit more mild (as well as pumpkin scented), I thought I would give it a shot.  I am not very impressed with it.  It really doesn't seem to provide the tingle, or deep clean that the fruit fiesta version offers.  Think I'll stick with the other.",3
This was my first BB cream. Loved the spf and the coverage. But it felt sticky on my face and I did not like that part:),3
"First off, I don't need spiking glue (at my age).  But, my kids have ""crazy hair day"" a few times per year at school - so spiking glue is a necessity in our house.  I was actually impressed with the Axe Spiking Glue.  At $8 the price is right.  It has allowed my kids to get more creative with their crazy hair.  It doesn't smell, it washes out easy.So overall, I would buy it again and 5-stars from me for price/value.",5
I was very apprehensive to buy this product after reading some of the reviews. We used liquid previously and it would always leave a residue on my glasses. We started using this and added white vinegar to the drying agent compartment and my dishes come out nice and clean:) BTW we have low end dish washer.,5
"I read the reviews on this product, followed the directions & still ended up with cardboard hair. If there was a way to give this stuff a minus star rating I would. Honestly I can't believe how damaging it turned out to be with simply one use! Used it last night & got on to request a refund first thing this morning! Curly haired people BEWARE!!",1
This is a silky oil that leaves my skin super soft.  I add it on top of my moisturizer for a little extra boost during the winter months.  It doesn't break me out and seems to be improving the surface of my skin.,5
"I have fairly clear 30ish skin with occasional pimples. I do have a problem with my very fair skin having uneven skin tone. However, on a cyclical cycle I do get small quasi-break-outs that usually appear as red spots on my chin and T zone. This product promises reduced redness overnight, which just didn't happen for me. Nor did I find that it exfoliates. Rather, I think that when I use this I actually had more skin irritation. This is one of those situations where individual response is going to vary so much. However if you have sensitive skin that is fair (and hence shows up every little variation in color) - I cannot recommend it based on MY experience, but it may be just right for someone younger with more regular break-outs. I have had excellent luck with weekly use ofBoscia Luminizing Black Mask 2.8 oz.",3
"I have been trying to find a toner that isn't as harsh on the skin. Came upon this one and gave it a try. Must say its the best toner I have gotten. Smells wonderful not a harsh chemical nasty smell, smells floral but clean. Leaves my face beautiful rarely have to put lotion on after and thats rare for my dry skin. Skin is smoother and I feel like its more even. A must have!",5
"I didn't love the effects of this Peace cream but liked it.  It holds my hair well, a bit more weight than I normally would prefer.  This will be potentially a great cream for those with very thick hair.  The scent is subtle and good.",4
"Sad to say I did not see a huge mprovement. The product did last me two months, but the packaging is cheap,caused more fine lines around my eye and I will not repurchase. I gave two stars because it made my dark circles less noticeable but that's just temporary and the samples they sent with it worked way better. They sent the scrub and the serum. I don't recommend this product.",2
"I have this liner in charcoal. I plan to get other colors eventually (though I will get eggplant soon), but I have several high end gel eyeliners in other colors.  When those run out, I will be replacing them with this.  It applies well and stays on all day.  The included brush is far too soft in my opinion.  I use the ecotools eyeliner brush for perfect application.",5
"Whoever was the &#34;architect&#34; of this solution in terms of applicator failed miserably. Super messy, everything is bound to get in your eye, it only looks nice n easy in their commercial. But just like so many commercials it is very far from reality. The dye is stingy ( if gets in your eye) but weak - doesn't last as long as they claim and never gets really black on your eye lashes even after 2 or 3 repetitions. I still had to use mascara after this. This product needs  serious work.",2
"I've been using this for 2 months now when I get out of the shower and my skin is more even, and breakouts way less.  I also love the lavender oil for when you need to heal a scar or blemish on your face.  I'd buy them together.  Good value for sure.",5
"I have a grandmother that refuses to use anything that she can figure out what the ingredients are, but I got her this and she uses it everyday and she says it works wonders. I am happy to have made her happy, plus she suffers from skin cancer and has skin scars from it so this stuff does make her feel better about how she looks.",5
Works better than I thought -- also cheaper than in stores.  (Not sure why I need to enter sooo many words).,5
"I have really dry skin from time to time and Vaseling Total Moisture Body Lotion is the perfect solution to this problem. This lotion goes on smooth and is not heavy, leaving skin rich and moisturized. I have always liked Vaseline products and this lotions fits in well with other products on the market. I like the smell, not too overpowering. This lotion does what it is supposed to do.",5
"For having a bunch of promises about how well it'll work, this bottle is only about a two-week supply, and it makes no difference in anything--sweat, breath, etc. Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints!",1
"That warning always ""duh's"" me out but I guess they have to cover all bases.It seems hair-dryer manufacturers are working overtime to come up with fancy descriptions.  ""nano diamond tourmaline ceramic "" ?  Nano usually means billionth , we know what diamond means. Tourmaline is crystal boron silicate mineral or trigonal borosilicate  gemstone, October birthstone and 8th wedding anniversary  stone. Uuuuuuuh? must be something good.Now that I have thoroughly confused you I'll tell you the hairdryer works as a hair dryer. Nothing earth-shaking. There is a hot and warm setting as well as high and low.  It seems to me it would have been more convenient if the switches  were located on the other side of the handle instead of under the palm of the hand. The ""cold"" button is on the other side and you just hold it down for cool air.  The concentrator works well for just drying a small section of hair, say maybe your bangs. The diffuser is the size of a saucer and snaps on fairly securely. A cap on the back end snaps off for cleaning. There is a hanging loop because you shouldn't wrap the cord around the dryer. Sort of noisy . Test and reset buttons on the plug. Two year warranty.BTW: There was a strong burning plastic smell when the dryer was first used but it went away so maybe no problem.",3
"I don't really buy citrus-scented anything. It's not my favorite smell. This one, however is quite nice. It's not overly strong, lathers well and doesn't seem to dry my skin. I'd buy it again.",5
"Wow! I'm impressed with this lotion.  To be honest, I usually just buy cheap lotion.  I mean really cheap lotion, like from the dollar store, thinking how much different could it be?  Isn't lotion just lotion with different marketing and/or packaging?  Oh, but I was a naive girl!  St. Ive's Intensive Healing Body Lotion is thick & creamy, my skin drinks it up and doesn't feel sticky.  Best of all though, I put it on at night after showering and it lasts a full day till the next night.  I no longer get that unpleasant dry, tight winter-skin feeling where you feel all sand-papery and scratchy, like the only thing that might help would be sitting in a vat of lotion. I'm a convert.",5
"I can't hate this product even if I want to.It's great and THEN some.SO at first, I didn't want to buy it because of the review about the Toluene that was in it. But when I bought it and used it, and saw how PERFECT they made my manicures, I had to study more about toluene. I couldn't possibly stop using the nail polish because it was JUST PERFECT!The bottle does have a warning on it about how SV ""contains a chemical that has been known in the state of California to cause Birth defects or possible reproductive problems"".  WHEN I read that, I WAS LIKE OH NO!!! The warning didn't say whether Toluene was the bad chemical though. Hmmph?Anyway, I used the nail polish again, and it was dry within seconds, shiny, perfect, no smudge, and just perfect.I really love the nail polish, but the Toluene bothered me.  I later learned that Toluene is taken in the body through inhalation.. so I somehow found a solution. I Use a facial mask when I paint my nails now. This product is all I have been waiting for. I love doing my own nails. it dries in seconds. I can take a shower after 15 minutes of applying, and no smudge or imprints on my nails.I use my mask right now, and I will probably stop using this product because my mind is not totally at peace with it yet.. but it really is a great product.Even though I have a problem with the product, I won't take away more than one star. Because it actually does what it says (and then some -- like a birth defect maybe?)lol.. Ok I kid.. But u get my point right?",4
Used this for contouring with matte bronzer. It works ok. It felt cheap for being sigma. I'll keep using it but I just don't feel it stood out from really any other contouring brush.,4
"I purchased this butter on 5/30 and received it today, 6/3. So delivery was prompt. It came in the famous ""to go"" container in 75 degree weather. Guess what, it was rock solid! I expected a puddle. It is ivory as advertised and sort of smells like shea. No grains, no black specs. But it does feel greasier/heavier than the yellow stuff I have gotten in the past. 4 stars because quantity was a little short of stated 16 oz. Worked very well in my homemade hair conditioner so I would likely order it again.",4
"This is a really pure shea butter and they are not kidding when they say it's &#34;ultra rich&#34;! A tiny bit goes a long way. The first I used, I way over did it. The consistency was not what I was expecting at first but it goes on silky smooth. Seriously though, go light at first!",5
"This night cream makes my skin really soft and smooth, althought it stings.  Willing to deal with a little stinging for great results.",4
"This product has a variety of uses, all of which are very effective. I don't understand the poor review(s). The product is high quality and all natural.It erases razor burn and razor bumps within a few hours, and the soothing effect was immediate. Can be applied after waxing for soothing effect as well! Also helps with ingrown hairs that have become inflamed.Good for use after intimacy, as friction can leave sensitive skin irritated. Soothes and has antibacterial properties, great if you can't shower immediately after.Good for use during intimacy, natural and organic lubricant. Much better than sticky, fake fruity smelling lubricant that's full of chemicals.I definitely recommend, ladies. So give it a try!",4
"Gave my sister this for a small Christmas gift. She loved it and so did I. I think I used more of it than she did, oops.",5
A great value for experimenting with your looks.  You have endless combinations with these little gems. Easy to apply with tweezers.,5
"It's hard to think of more to say than this - it does what it claims.  The hold is good, the look is matte and not shiny, and it does not feel crunchy or sticky.  I really don't notice an odor, so it's not strong at all.  After applying it, neither my hair nor my hands felt sticky or slimy.  It's a good product, IMO.I've used one of their wet-look gels, too, and that was indeed shiny if that's what you prefer.  This matte finish is more my style.Going through high school in the late 80's, I used my share of hair products from back then, and this stuff is far better to me.  The stuff that I used was stiff, crunchy, and felt sticky.  I wish this would have been around when more of my hair still was.  :)Recommended.",4
Used this shampoo and my  hair has never felt heather and alive. I really was shocked by how much livelier my hair has been these past few weeks. I found this product extremely excellent and highly effective. Would buy again!!,5
"I really think my skin looks different now. I got the whole sequence of products, this is just one step, and I loved it",5
"The brushes are very soft, I love the feel. But its like 3 brushes and the rest are dups....i was very disapointed. Doesn't include a cream/liquid foundation brush. and out of 32 brushes you would think it would! the picture looks better than what you actually get. TOO MANY DUPS, not enough variety.",2
"these nails are great because you can virtually decorate them anyway you want because they are clear, you can use these to try out the different color acrylic powders. I love the length and how many nails come in the packages. They came in ten different little pouches all labeled 0-9, very cute",5
"So soft, milky & powdery. Very sexy but still appropriate for daytime wear. Sweet/tart apricot wrapped in coconut/vanilla/almond. Once had a guy tell me it smelled like ""sexy sunscreen"".. haha.",5
I'm a nail tech and I collect tips for different shaped nails - this set was a nice addition to my collection!,5
Love these. So cute for nail art designs or a phone case. I will be purchasing again when these run out!,5
"After the first application you can see the results. I use it at nights, and in the morning my face looks radiant and healthy, and without causing dryness as other retinol products. I will continue with this treatment for a very long time.",5
"I have used this product once a week for 3 weeks now.  I have a very oily Tzone and huge pores on my forehead, along with the inside of the cheeks near the nose.  My skin is now far less oily, my pores have tightened up considerably and my skin is really smooth.  I did not have a lot of blackheads to begin with but what I did have is gone.Honestly I got more results from the professional TCA peel that I had done but I also had to live through near 10 days of blood red, cracked and peeling skin that looked awful and required Aquaphor ointment smeared on it every hour or so.  If you want results over time this is probably the product for you.  If you need immediate dramatic results you may be better served with the TCA peel.  I noticed a significant difference after the first use and have continued to see positive results.  I am satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.",4
"So there are some pros and cons to this set and I would say for the amazon price...I wouldn't jump, but as others have mentioned, Costco has it for thirty.At that price...I am likely to keep it. But for more...Meh.Pros:-Cute lamp that works-Battery powered and small. Thus portable.-Kit has Full sized base/top coat. Full sized bonder. 5 mini colors.---First Crush: Pale pink....kind of too translucent imo. Would be good for a french manicure, but it definitely takes some layering before it becomes opaque---Dynamic Duo: described as a dark mauve, but actually I think it makes me think of a more dark pink. Mauve makes me think there's some purple in it...there's not.---Mermaid: not precisely a Tiffany blue. I think it's darker than say China Glaze's Audrey by quite a bit. More of a darkdark Tiffany blue--Diamonds: Takes some buildup to get opaque. It's a silver glitter. It's decent.--The last one is actually the only one I haven't tested/swatched yet...but it looks red orange in the bottle.-Gel feels good, cures very bright and shiny. Feels nice and solid.CONSNo matter how hard I tried and how many layers, the polish actually shrinks as it cures, revealing the tips of my nails. It's very strange. I did 3 coats and you can still see the ""white"" of my fingernails. I even tried painting practically over and UNDER the tips but it still shrunk away revealing my whites.Can't fit the whole hand, but I've actually found that I can do the fingers + the thumb of my opposite hand at the same time...so those who don't want to have to cure a total of 4 times per round...that's my suggestion over trying to shove your whole hand in (I have a small hand too).Still...I wish it didn't shrink back and that the opacity was better on the First Crush and the MermaidIf Hautelook has another sale, I might contemplate buying some more colors....Anything more than thirty...I wouldn't keep. But for a starter gel kit? It's not bad at all and I'm a sucker for the heartshaped LED lamp and I love that the base/top coat is a 2 in 1.If you have never gone gel...the costco price isn't bad to start you out.Yes, there are stronger lamps out there...and some that have plugs instead of batteries.....and some even have timers (this does not, you gotta use a separate one, like your phone)..still...the heart shape...so cuteUPDATE: 11/15/2013 - just a small one :)Have tried sandwiching regular nail polish in between the gel base/top.....don't do it. LOL It gets wrinkly.Tried a different gel color brand (sally hansen) and I am getting barely any white tips! So that's a huge plus for me. Only downside is, like all gel bottles, it too, is quite tiny...the ""mini"" description I gave earlier is incorrect in that it implies that the gel color comes in bigger bottles...it does not, which seems to be true for all gel brands. I tried Sally's Commander in Chic...it ends up curing pretty dark taupe...not sure if I love it...especially at $12? Meh. Trying to sandwich in RCM colors next (soon as my shipment arrives!) but so far...Sally brand is better for color than it's own NailUV colors!Still. I am happy with my purchase as the lamp works, the base and top coat work and other gel colors work just fine :) So I am not confined to NailUV at all.",3
"More like a gel in a jar, this 'pomade' works fine for me.I just take a quick small swipe or two with a finger, rub it between my palms and scrunch my hair here and there again and again.It gives a bit of a lift and style without a heavy concentration of product.Light fragrance that does not linger.",3
"Smells very nice, good suds, and very clean.  Rinsing nicely, too.  I have dry skin, especially in the winter months, and this is not drying at all.  I am usually pleased with Caress products, and this one does not disappoint.",4
Smells the same as Young Living Rose. Yes for those of you who are loyal to Young Living...I already know that YL's rose oil is not diluted. Nevertheless the NOW smells fantastic although I would not say the therapeutic properties are exactly the same as Young Living since this an absolute. Nevertheless get this oil and save yourself over 100 bucks. If you are and purist or avid therapeutic oil user then you should look elsewhere.NOW oils in lavender essential and lemon essential are also comparable to Young Livings if you're on a budget.,5
"I have been searching for the perfect mascara for pretty much my whole life. I had one that I was using that I really thought was great but it was kind of clumpy and it flaked off during the day. Still, it was the best I had found so far so I used it. Well then I went on Amazon and started searching and I read the reviews for this mascara. It does not flake off during the day, it lengthens lashes dramatically with just one application, and it DOES NOT CLUMP. I will be using this mascara for a long time.",5
I use this to keep my nails growing. It makes them grow faster. And they look better too. I order it when ever I run out.,5
"Very smooth lotion, makes my skin so dang soft I end up feeling myself up like a weirdo. Softness stayed even after some hand-washing. Soaks in fast, extremely yummy smell. Exactly like those creamy fruit ice cream bars. Scents ( I have both this and the chai tea scentThe Naked Bee Chai Tea Hand & Body Lotion 8 oz lotion) don't last a long time, but for a little bit, yes. Never knew bee's smelt so good naked! Will continue to order as long as I can afford to.I'm prone to acne and I consider myself sensitive skin but I've had no negative changes since using this product on my face.",5
I wear my hair natural  i used this product when i need to blow dry my hair. I keep my hair silky,3
"I got this in the mail yesterday and put it on a bit before bedtime.  Unlike several pricier serums, it did not just sit on top of my pores.  It was absorbed and tightened my skin.  Plus it moisturized and left my skin notably softer, lasting until morning.  I a not happy with the 30 SPF which blocks Vitamin D production.  Otherwise I highly recommend it.",5
". . . more expensive stuff I have.  Granted that I have good skin to start with but seriously, this Ponds moisturizer feels exactly the same as others I have.  Nice aroma and gives me the dewiness I expect from a moisturizer.  $3.99 each, it's a no-brainer.  Get it.  The only important thing about moisturizer is that we use it at least twice a day.  What we use barely matters.  That we use it is is key.  (Face must be either freshly washed with a facial cleanser or if no make-up on, I rinse with a clean wash cloth.  In either case, apply the moisturizer to damp skin.)",5
"It got rancid pretty quick, and this is not cheap. I did keep it in the dark cabinet as the instructions said.",2
"The pencil was greasy, coming off on my eyebrow hairs. The company emailed me if I were not satisfied to let them know and they sent me another pencil, which was slightly less greasy. Its not their fault. The pencil is L'Oreal and its just not that great a product.The price was right.",3
"The smell, is just like a clean spring day when you walk outside and can smell the beautiful smells of spring lilacs and hyacinths.  The consistency is just right for using as shampoo or body wash, it will make you feel as delightful as it smells.",4
"this is great stuff.  I'm a big believer in hand washing and even before any guest in my house sits down for dinner, I gently remind them to wash their hands !  I have a young nephew that lives with me and he loves the foaming action on this and the smell, well, is fantastic !  It really smells like tangerine. It makes your hands soft afterwards.  My other soaps always had me running for the hand lotion.  Actually, on all my sinks, I have hand soap and hand lotions.  With this soap, you don't need it and the little ones hands smell and feel just as nice.  I think I found my new soap in the future.",5
"This is what I finally bought after trying commercial moisturizing bubble baths that DON'T work.  Highly reviewed, works very well I'm a ath, following guidelines, & using between 1-2 oz. only--no more. Adding some relaxing oil essences (15-20 drops)/lavender or chamomile, for example, is a nice idea for a relaxing, moisturizing, delicious bath experience.  Oil has no smell--pure & natural & produced for using as a skin moisturizer.  Really pleased w/thisUr chase--it's a keeper.",5
"WOW...what a rip off! You create HEAT when you mix a base (baking soda) and an acid (TCA, glycolic acid, etc)! Non-professional trying to make money off of selling a worthless or even damaging product!",1
"First of all, I have to say that 2 of the nail tape I received were damaged, although I could get them to work, it is hard to put them on since they roll of, you have to put them on top of wet nail polish. I will give them 4 stars because I got 3 pink and 4 purple, I didn't get some of the colors that I would've wanted.",4
"When I opened the box that the case comes in I was so happy that it was such good quality. Then, I noticed a weird black powder substance on it that got all over my hands it was not make up either. After wiping it off and opening the case I was a little disappointed because the circles of eye shadow are a lot smaller than I thought and I really dont think they will last very long.",3
Look at these Clear Cosmetic Cases! How cute and you can see thru it to make sure you have everything inside instead of having to open the case which is a neat approch. This is a great way to make you keep your make up organized or you will feel embarrassed i know i would.,5
i am sure there was a main delay and that is fine. i love the pink acrylic powder and i would order it again. thank you.,5
Great but one down fall is the pink rubbery part  item used to hold the clear nail soackers will break need to be more sturdy and stronger but other than that it would be great to use.,3
"i got it is works fine, thank you.",5
"I use this about 2 times a week with my daily face wash....Over the last year I have had major acne issues, so I have been using this to get rid of build up of dead acne skin left behind (gross I know) but I my face feels awesome when I'm done",5
"Pricey, yes. Does a small amount work like a miracle on my coarse frizz-i-fied aging hair? YES!!! I have been using Wen cleansing conditioner on my hair for a while now but do need the occasional shampoo to really give it a solid give-me-some-shine cleansing... but I was afraid that shampooing would ruin all the repairing work Wen has done so far.. Not so! N.4 Luminere d'hiver clarifying shampoo seriously does not strip hair of those essential oils that keep healthy hair healthy - and I've tried numerous drugstore 'repair' shampoos and none of them come even close... and the scent? Gorgeous!!! Not cloying, but lovely and sophisticated. I love the shampoo so much I will be getting the Leau de Mer Hydrating Conditioner for those days when I want a little extra conditioning (and lovely scent) than I get from a Wen treatment (sorry serious Wen people, I do stray from the rules)!!! Highly recommend you drop the extra bucks and try this stuff... it's like Champagne vs. Schlitz! Seriously!",5
"Aaah, the aroma of lavender is just so pleasant.  This is such a treat for when you bathe.This power-packed bar of soap contains lavender oil, which will leave you feeling refreshed ans smelling good.  Some of the earlier versions contained actual lavender buds that were good exfoliants and were an olfactory treat.As a bonus, you also get olive oil and shea butter, which also smells good mixed in with this soap.  This wonderful smelling exfoliating product will make showering an activity to anticipate.This is high-end soap that is worth what it costs.",5
"I have fine, dry, curly hair that frizzes even in dry weather. The problem with curly hair is that it can look unkempt and messy if you don't use a good product to get rid of frizz and soften the hair. I use Cholesterol once a week. I apply liberally and work it into my hair, and massage it into my scalp. Then I run a wide-toothed comb through it, to make sure all strands are covered, put a plastic cap over my hair and put a warming cap ob and leave it on for about half an hour.  WOW! what a difference it makes. No frizz, just beautiful shiny curls that I am actually happy with.A bonus feature is that it soothes my dry, itchy scalp. No more embarassing head scratching.",5
"Like almost all of Benefit's product, this stuff is truly amazing. I have fair skin that tends to look rather dull. I had always wanted a nice, healthy glow, but it seemed to me that most of the products that were formulated for that purpose were either bronzers or just too glittery. I didn't want bronze skin, nor did I want to look like I came out of a time machine from the nineties. High Beam is perfect. It really illuminated my face and made my skin look so beautiful. It's neither glittery or shimmery; it just glows! I really think you can use it for any occasion, but I tend to wear it in the colder months when my skin is a bit lackluster. It may seem expensive, but one bottle of this lasts for a really long time. I've have mine for just over a year and I've only used half of the bottle. It's well worth the price.",5
"Get this. Now. Seriously. I have bitten my nails since I was a kid and I have not bitten my nails for two weeks now (since I started using this). I actually have some fingernails to paint now. It tastes horrible, which is exactly what I wanted. It is not peppery- it is something else that's way more putrid. Similar to licking a cotton swab of fingernail polish remover. I have to reapply every two days or so because the bad taste fades after that amount of time. Be careful when you eat finger food, as the taste can get on your food. I am delighted with this product.",5
"This cream eyeliner is pretty mediocre compared to the e.l.f. I purchased on the same day.  This is much less pigmented, and has an almost too thin/creamy consistency.  I have to keep applying more and more layers to try and get a rich dark blue, and even then I end up going over it with another eyeliner.  The brush is terrible, a total throwaway.  Definitely use your own.  The blue itself is beautiful, just the right amount of lightness/darkness to be seen and noticed, but not overly flashy or cheap looking.  My husband loves the shade.  Even though I have lots left, I'm giving up on this and going to purchase e.l.f. instead.  Waste of money.",2
"i like and use this. but i wouldnt repurchase as its not better than my favorite one, got2b rockin encore dry shampoo. also i think this may have been irritating to my scalp..",4
"Very attractive, and good fitting mask.  It isn't quite professional quality but is above a regular beginner's mask.  The skirt is wider than my normal scuba mask which can be both good or bad depending on the shape of your face.  Due to receiving it in the winter I haven't been able to use it while SCUBA diving but it fit well and the snorkel breaths well.  I did find that the band holding the mask on tangled easily in my hair.  I generally wear a bandana over my hair when diving to keep my hair from getting tangled, but I long for the day when something is created to hold on a mask which doesn't tangle up your hair.  This is a nice mask for the price and will make for an excellent snorkel or SCUBA mask for those that don't want to invest in a professional mask.",4
"I am super picky when it comes to scents! When I say picky I mean it... I like sweet, but it can't be too sweet. Hate strong smells, hate most floral scents. I don't know how I managed to get a collection as big as I have of perfume. This is the newest to my collection and boy does it smell amazing. Not too strong. The scent smells like blueberries and flowers, but it's light. It is a sweet, fresh smell. So pleased I picked this up. Also got a bottle for my aunts 65th birthday and she also loves it. This goes to show that this works for women of all ages (I am less than half her age for reference.) Do not recommend for women that like very strong bold scents. Beautiful scent.",5
I've seen lots of people talk about JBCO on you tube so I thought I'd give it a try.  This is my second bottle that I've ordered and it does seem to be growing back my edges.  I massage it in every night at bedtime.  I'm going to give this 3 bottles before I can really tell if it's working or not but I believe it is.,5
Love the great color.  Now I can do my own nails at home rather than go to a salon each time.  Great when combined with the OPI base and top coats.,5
This is really good for dark spots and dark scars. The fade is gradual so you don't have to worry about having extra light spots the next day. I also like the fact that its not greasy.,5
"From my wife:I previously lived in France for over 8 years and still return every year for a summer beach holiday.  I became a fan of L'Oreal and for me their products are synonymous with great quality and good value. I especially love their shampoos and skin care products. I am 60 and have dry sensitive skin with very few wrinkles amd I am always glad to try L'Oreal's new moisturizers. The last ones I used were"" L'Oreal Revitalift Complete Day Cream"" and "" Nutrissime Night Cream"" for dry and sensitive skin. I was very satisfied with them , so I was also glad to try this ""Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream"".I loved it from the beginning. It is smooth, silky, gets quickly absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any greasy residue. I put it on every morning and evening and after 2 weeks I feel my skin is tighter and softer. I also adore its citrus smell.  When spending several weeks in the sun on a beach vacation, I feel that this is the best treatment for my face after all the sun and sea water it endures.One more little note- at the time I write this, its Amazon price is the about the same as it cost in a French supermarket (Carrefour) where I was vacationing, very good value.I give this moisturizer 5 stars.  And yes, I will buy another jar once I finish with this one.",5
"I have been using this product for years and I love it.I have thick, highlighted blonde hair and I use this product everytime I style my hair and I couldn't be happier.Always leaves my hair feeling soft and managable.",5
"I like this Revitalift but will not reorder.  It just isn't special.  I'll use it up and then move on to something else.  It isn't bad, it's just not great.The hunt continues.",4
"My husband is extremely particular with smells.  He has move soap products than I do.  I noticed that as the winter months have worn on, his skin was getting a little flaky.  I know that exfoliation isn't something he pays a lot of attention to, but I wanted his skin to look smooth and prevent any ingrown hairs.  This bar is the perfect solution.  It has the little bumps within it to get rid of dead skin cells and smells like a man instead of traditional Dove products.  He is pleased with the scent and the fact that he is getting less red bumps along his chin line.  I've noticed that his skin looks moisturized even though I can not get him to use lotion.  We've both been very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"to me this was very strong perfume, It will remind you of your grandmother, not for me. The scent also lasts very long and have me a headache.",1
"This curling iron looks very nice and works great as well. It feels well made and durable - not cheap feeling or looking.Definitely use the glove because it is very easy to burn your hand, obviously. The glove feels kind of awkward at first, but you get used to it quickly. For a touch up, or just a quick curl or two, I can manage without the glove if I am really careful, but if you're doing you're whole head you'll want to use the glove.It heats up hot and fast and I haven't experienced any malfunctions or problems with the iron at all.You can get different types of curls by wrapping the hair different ways. I'd suggest ""playing"" with it for a while before deciding to use it for a special occasion hairdo, etc..just so that you are familiar with hhow the curls will turn out by wrapping certain ways. The design of the iron makes it nice for getting more lift/body at the roots, so that when your hair ""falls"" you don't end up with straight hair for the root area and first couple inches. You can wrap the hair starting from the top or the bottom of the iron, depending on your desired results. If your hair is longer, you should use thinner sections of hair and/or let it wrapped on the iron longer since it will take longer to heat the hair and hold the curl.If you have a friend or family member that you can use as a guinea pig to try the iron out on for the first time, that helps too, to get used to how to use it, see the different ways the curl will turn out depending on how you wrap it and get comfortable using it. It is always a little harder doing your own hair than someone elses.",5
"I'm often having difficulty when ordering nail art supplies that you get the item but you have 10 of the same color or design or the item arrives and its not as pictured as described. Well, I'm very happy with this one. Item arrived and is EXACTLY as pictured and the container was full of the decorations, not partially full. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes it. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and is great!",5
Nearest thing to what we had as kids (long time ago). I dunno but skin looks cleaner and fresher with this than anything else. Great for kids and teenagers.,5
I have naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to comb after showering but after discovering this product my problems are a thing of the past. My hair has been so much healthier and manageable since using It's a 10. Spray it on after washing your hair when it's still wet and you'll feel the difference right away. Amazon has the best price that I have ever seen for it.,5
I love this moisturizer!  The texture is so light and it absorbs easily into my skin.  I wear this moisturizer every night with a separate eye cream.  Another plus about this product is that it does not contain excessive fragrance.,5
"Have only used one so far, but really like that it is clear serum and not milky like other brands.",4
"Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of styling mousse. My short, fine textured, colored hair feels weighed down by lots of styling products. I regularly use Dove Moisture shampoo w/o additional conditioner, other than a tiny amount of Dove's leave-in conditioner for color treated hair when my hair might get frizzy from dampness, wind or cold weather. The Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam feels like any other mousse product I've used in the past when my hair was longer. Meaning, it felt sticky upon application and a bit stiff when my hair dried. For that reason, I was tempted to rate this product 2 or 3 stars, but then figured if a potential customer reading this review LIKES mousse products and (especially) blow dries or otherwise styles her hair with heat (which I don't), she might give it 5 stars. Therefore, I've rounded up to 4. Your overall satisfaction with the foam will depend on the length and texture of your hair, and how you do--or don't--style it. What I didn't find was any added body to my hair. Again, a blow drier might be necessary to achieve that effect?",4
"I LOVE this foundation, sephora does not carry it anymore so being able to find it online had become difficult.Love the color and the coverage I get without feeling heavy.",5
"this case is well built, sturdy and strong material. I would reccomend this case to every woman. Great price for a great case.",5
"This product is exactly what it promised to be and looks so natural, I could not be happier with it",5
This one is more moisturizing than the pink BB cream from Skin 79.I have dry skin so that does make a difference.I do feel that this BB cream is a bit too gray for my complexion. After about 30 minutes (sometimes an hour) it does oxidize and blend in better. I also use a finishing powder so it's more matte and not so shiny.I like that the coverage is buildable but like I said I wish it wasn't so gray.,4
"While i thought I liked this fragrance on me, after wearing it i realized i did not like it. I don't know if it mixed funny with my pheremones, but it was not pleasant. It made me smell like an old lady (and i'm only 23). I will not be buying this fragrance again.",2
"This is really great eye make-up remover. It doesn't leave your skin oily (even though many eye make-up removers are labeled &#34;oil free&#34; many still leave an oily residue on your eyes). Putting some on a cotton ball, closing your eye, and letting it sit on your eye for about 20 seconds loosens up dirt and make-up, making it so easy to remove.I like how light this formula is and how quickly it works.This is also terrific for mistakes. Dipping a cotton swap in it and wiping off the mistake is super easy. It doesn't disturb any make-up you've already applied, saving your time and work. I haven't tried it on waterproof make-up, but since it isn't specifically labeled for waterproof eye make-up I would try something that is. Awesome for removal of regular eye make-up - or even just lightening up that raccoon look.",5
This does help with acne.  In the summer it comes in handy especially when using heavier sunscreens that can cause more breakouts.  In the winter use moisturizers at night to counteract drying.  The 2.5% may be better for everyday use.  The 10% is great a couple times a week at night.,5
"The top coat and base coat works perfectly, but the white and pink is pretty useless. There's barely any color in them. I would recommend anyone who's thinking about buying Shellack to just but top- and base coat and use regular nail polish as well with the Shellack.",3
I really like this lipstick. It's a very nice nude color and it's very creamy. I suggest to prep lips before applying this one or at least make sure your lips are not chapped because it won't look good on chapped lips. I don't use this color all the time but it complements a bronzy look and looks beautiful in summer.,4
"I've been told over and over to straighten my hair by hairdressers, but I'm not really very into fussy hairdo-ing.  I finally decided to give it a whirl, and was a little nervous, as I've never used a straightener alone before!  But this was super simple to use---I was almost confused by the directions as they were TOO simple!  They seemed to do a good job on my hair, but my hair is long and only a little wavy.  I liked how it looked when straightened.  However, then my son asked to try these.  He has EXTREMELY curly hair---it naturally forms an Afro, and we are not African-American, so he stands out.  He usually likes it, but wanted to see if he could get a different look.  The straightener just didn't seem to be up to the challenge, however.  We worked and worked and worked at it, but only got a very slight curl reduction.  His hair is very thick and short.  Maybe part of the problem was that I was a little scared of the heat---it seemed like it would be pretty easy to accidentally burn yourself with these, although of course there were safety warnings and we followed them, but when you had to get the heating part close to the scalp, it was a little nervewracking.  Overall, this seemed like a quality product.  It was solidly made and looked nice, heated up quickly and had a good feel to it.  If you are like me and just want to smooth down hair, it might be great, or if you have more experience, you might do better than I did with super curly hair.",4
"I am not in love but I can appreciate this product. The natural hair community raves about this product so much that i felt that i had to try it, even though it cost $17. I live in the Caribbean and it is not sold in my country, so i had no choice to order it. This product smells really nice, it is thick and moisturizes my hair. However i found a similar product locally which is the Cantu Coconut Curling Creme, which is cheaper, it smells exceptionally good, moisturizes and curls my hair.",4
"I purchased Smooth as Silk conditioner after reading rave reviews on Amazon and on haircare blogs. I was so disappointed when it didn't leave my hair feeling smooth, silky, or even soft. I used it at first as a deep conditioner and was unimpressed. I have been using it to co-wash until the product runs out and am getting the same lackluster results. I agree with the reviewers who commented on the impractical bottle design. I hope the company takes note. On a positive note, the citrus fragrance of the conditioner is nice for summer. I realize that products don't work the same for everyone, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying Smooth as Silk conditioner. It just didn't work for me.",2
"I straighten my hair maybe once or twice a month, so I didn't need to shell out for something expensive. This does the job surprisingly well. All of the settings and controls work, and it feels/appears to be pretty good quality equipment. Works perfectly for my needs.",4
"This eye shadow has an amazing performance. I was actually interested in a MAC palette since all of the tutorials with shadow I watch use them. But I wanted to NOT spend 80+ dollars so I tried this one instead, it looks nearly identical other than the name of course. I must say, the pigments show up quite well. I personally pair it with eye primer (link included) and it makes it show up and last all the better. Even the yellow shows up well and I'm very light skinned! There is literally every color one might need and even there isn't you could certainly mix one up. I am able to sport a different look every day now and I love it. I can't say every color is astounding since it will take months to wear them all, but I have no doubt they are all 5 stars with pigment and lasting ability. If you aren't a name brand junkie I definitely recommend this. You will have a longevity and great wear from it. I guess my only complaint would have to be that it is rather large, so it's not exactly portable unless you have a giant purse. Although I myself don't actually need to take it anywhere I'm sure many of you do make up for friends and family so that's really the only issue! Have fun and express yourselves.e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow Primer elf",5
"I really like this moisturizer. My 34-year old skin suffers from dryness and tightness, especially around the cheek area. This product helps ease the dryness and balances my skin beautifully. The texture of this white cream is light and creamy, and not at all greasy. It absorbs into the face and neck quickly and leaves behind no residue. It feels comparable to a luxury moisturizer.I find that it works well on all areas of my face and is gentle enough to use around the eye area too. The container is easy to use and has a sturdy twist-off lid. I love it and I would definitely buy it again. Im also confident it is light enough to use in warmer weather.",5
"This matte finish top coat looks great and dries really fast. Unlike what some of the other reviewers said, it didn't wear off quickly for me. I used it with black, and it did the &#34;dull shiny nail thing&#34; only after a week. I didn't have any problem with it chipping until after a week, either. Then again, I don't regularly use hand lotion.",5
"The body wash used in conjunction with the Aqua Glycolic body lotion, has irradicated my former issue of hyperpigmentaion (blotchy/uneven skin tone) on my back and arms. These two products combined have also greatly improved condition of keratosis pilaris (annoying bumps on backs of my arms), which no amount of scrubbing ever cured.",5
"I was tired of spending a good 20 minutes on my nails and having them chip off two days later, so I decided to dive in head first and bought this gel polish,Valentine's Day Best Present For Her - MelodySusie Violetilac 2013 Newest Super Mini Compact Led Gels Nail Dryer For Harmony Gelish Soak Off Series, OPI Gelcolor Nail Polish, Orly Gel FX, Red Carpet Led Gel Polish + MelodySusie Nail Nipper - You Can Tak..., andGelish Basix Kitall at the same time. I shopped around a bit first and decided to go with the LED light since many people complained that UV took too long. My hands are fairly tiny so I saved a couple bucks and went for the mini light - I was very happy with the result.Pros:- smooth polish, no streaks as with non-gel nail polish- dries quickly with LED light; much more preferable than waving your hands around or dipping them in cold water to settle the polish- long lasting; no chips, color wears away over timeCons:- must clean as you go; if you cure your nails with some sloppy polish around the edges, you'll be stuck with it. I found keeping some wet cotton swabs nearby very helpful.- color appears darker on screen; colors vary from screen to screen, but the swatch color itself is much less accurate than customer review photosOverall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. :) The investment will pay for itself after 2-3 different colors/touch ups. I would highly recommend this and the other products listed to anyone thinking they would like to delve into DIY gel nails.",5
There is a brush for everything! I love all the options I am able to have while I do my makuep,5
"great product! natural, acne face wash that doesn't leave skin feeling tight or dry. Gentle enough to use day and night!",5
These are good for beginners or non professional nail artist. They can also be used for any other craft projects.,4
I've been using this for a while it's okay. I don't feel like it does much for my skin but everyone's skin is different.,3
"Ive been using this little eyeshadow quad gem for a couple years now (Natural Smokes). I love the colors, and use them pretty much everyday for a natural, beautiful brown smokey eye look. I rarely purchase drugstore makeup but this stuff is great! Use with an eye primer, brushes and you are good to go. Hope they keep these colors! You can find this at Wal-mart, or any other drugstore so don't pass this one up.",5
"One of the best primer I am using right now. Minimize pores, improve skin texture, create great CANVAS for smooth long lasting makeup. And it makes much more easier to remove makeup. After 3 times use, immediately changed to 1 month subscribe.",5
"The product is shorter than i expected, but i do love the cute look and the color wasn't very pigmented, which I do like. It's kinda moisturize my lips too.",4
"I absolutely love it. The color is very pretty, has very good coverage. Is not sticky or tacky. I highly recommend.",5
"looks more natural than many others sold like this, however most of the lashes fall off while removing them from the carton.",3

"I have really thick hair, so I'm picky about my conditioner.  This conditioner by Adovia works pretty well.  I wouldn't rate it as the 'best' on really thick hair, but it does a good job.  On my daughter's hair, which is less thick, it does a fabulous job. I don't care for the fragrance in the conditioner, and I'm not sure of the purpose of the fragrance, and usually stray away from items with fragrance altogether. Although I like the way this conditioner works, I'm disappointed in the ingredient list.  Mixed in with the healthy dead sea mud, olive oil, grape seed oil is Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and Cocamide Dea.  I'm looking forward to trying this conditioner when the bad ingredients are taken out the more awesome stuff is put in.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.",3
"I don't know why my experience with this product is different from the other reviewers.  I bought this based on reviews!  And it was a pricey mistake.  I don't notice any difference when I apply this powder, other than my face seems a little lighter.  I force myself to use it because of how much I paid for it, but when I forget, I don't miss it at all.  I am puzzled!  I still have a lot left but when I'm done with it, I definitely won't buy it again.",2
"I have super thick hair so that's probably a factor of this, but when I used these, they creased my hair after just fifteen minutes of having them in. Kind of a pain but oh well. They're really cute and great as hair ties, just not if you have thick hair. Unless I'm using it wrong but I don't think so.",2
"I have never owned a shower mirror, so I have no other product to compare it against.  But, I did expect more for $50.  First off, this isn't really a mirror (probably for safety reasons), but more of a plasticy foil material.  Second, it has to be filled up with warm water before each use to prevent it from fogging.  These two things were actually what made me not like this shower &#34;mirror.&#34;",2
"I have used everything you can imagine to cover up my increasingly salt and pepper roots. Dying my hair every two weeks is definitely not an option. My hair is dyed auburn -- a medium shade. My mother, aunts and sister all used this -- it's been around for years. Compared to other products, this price is very reasonable, and it lasts for some time. The Auburn is always first to sell out at beauty supply stores, so I'm now getting it from Amazon.I'm also a fan of the much more expensive Joan Rivers product, but Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon is great in a pinch, and the price speaks for itself. Very highly recommended. Follow directions and you will not be disappointed.",5
"The glue works extremely well, once you get the nail finally set. It was hard keeping the glue on the nail itself rather than my fingers. It poured all over, I think that's because I was a dummy and made a large hole in the top. Each of the bottles hardly contain any fluid, and some have more than others - a little inconsistent. However, for the price paid for 10 bottles I cannot complain. It works very well, otherwise. Probably will buy again. Note: I am only an amature, so any application issues are more likely my fault, not the product's.",4
I had high hopes for this night cream as I wanted to have a mositurizer for night and day. After two days I strated to break out bad all over my face. I even tried just using the product on just my neck and chest and noticed that started to break out there as well.,1
"I order this connect oil to use on my hair, it does liquify upon touch but doesn't have that nice coconut smell I'm used to. It has no smell at all which some people may like. Otherwise it does the job.",4
Well it's good but the nail shape is a little too small for nails.So there's no way to keep the nail in place. It's decent butI think I will have to put double stick tape to put nails on thereSo I can practice nail art. So it's ok.,2
"This is one of the best scrub products we have found, and works nicely on the sensitive skin of a redhead. While it could be used daily, it really does not need to be used that often, so the container lasts well, too.",5
"The label claims 100% of women who use this see lighter skin after 8 weeks, using it twice daily.  They don't say if the lighter skin is their own or not, he he.  But seriously...Pleasant lemony fragrance and creamy oatmeal-colored lotion in this little bottle.  They use the same home-remedy for lightening skin that has been around since before the original Brady Bunch: lemon juice or other types of citric acid. Using it in low concentrations means waiting weeks and weeks to see if it works.  If used faithfully, this method has been proven to work some. Unfortunately, they give us only 30 days to review products, so I can't say if this worked for me or not.  I'll have to update my review in two months.",3
"It takes some practice to use powder, but once you get the hang of it, it's worth dealing with blue powder on your face.  It comes off easily with eye make- up remover or in my case coconut oil, and it creates a great exotic look.  Just stick the tip in the corner of your eye, close our eye and draw the stick across the inside of the eye.  Just make sure your lashes aren't in the way.  I also like to draw the stick across my eye 2or 3 times without re-dipping the stick.  Then if you have a little patch that needs more color just use the tip like you would a pencil. Just make sure you know this is a POWDER eyeliner and not a dried out tube of liquid liner.",5
This lotion helps heal those super dry hands and arms. It works great for living out in the desert.  I love it.,5
"I use these green discs for my PMD and they keep my skin smooth, fresh, and youthful. My face is in love with it.",5
"I can't decide if this is sunscreen with makeup or makeup with sunscreen. It is 40 SPF (multiply by 20 to get minutes of protection ), no fragrance, parabens, PABA or phthalates.I have slightly dry , fair skin (not pale) so I use a non-oily moisturizer and give it plenty of time to absorb before I apply the Cotz.  It goes on like silk to a matte finish and the color blends perfectly into my skin. Makeup can be applied over it but I wear it alone. It feels natural all day.I can't give the Cotz a perfect five stars for one reason, the price. It is $19.99 for 1.5 oz and certainly not something you'd want to slather on before working in the yard.Great product but guess I'll stick with my neutrogena ultra sheer  dry-touch sunblock unless I win the lottery.",4
These clips can actually be moved for thicker hair and I assume very curly hair (of which I have neither). They are unique in this manner and have a cool look to theml. I myself have thinner hair but know these would work great for my girlfriends with the thicker hair. I do love these however I will say my hair did get caught in one which hurt a little. The price is not bad. Although these are probably not meant to wear I plan on trying them out with a hair style of some sort of up do.  They are perfect for when you want to section off your hair for drying etc. It' worth a try.,4
"I'm still not sure how this product is working (thus, I can only give it four stars), but it seems pretty nice. I was using castor oil for a few months to try and prevent wrinkles and get rid of fine lines around my eyes. It was too thick for my skin though (I just turned 20, and have thin, normal/dry white-person skin). I remembered seeing jojoba oil in Trader Joes and buying some when I was around 17 for my acne...but now that my acne isn't tooooo bad, I'm going for anti-aging. I still have some acne/acne-prone skin, but jojoba oil doesn't make me break out.I wear a physical 55-70+ sunscreen everyday I leave the house, and since it is the physical stuff it makes my skin white and a bit dry looking. With jojoba oil in my sunscreen I can apply a 25 cent amount to my face and neck with no problems -- plus it makes my skin shiny, but not too much!The one issue I have noticed is that sometimes my skin feels dry/tight. I never experienced this until using jojoba oil. So yea...maybe in another 15 years or so I'll give an Amazon-update on how jojoba oil and my entire regimen has worked for my skin. If they don't have an anti-aging pill or something out by then, then hopefully my update will help people decided whether to take or leave what I used/jojoba oil. XDAnyways, this oil is very light, contains natural spf, and good as a conditioning-treatment for hair. :)",4
"After developing allergies to practically every antiperspirant on the market, it was refreshing to find one that finally worked and didn't cause a rash.  This clear gel goes on smoothly, dries fast and doesn't stain clothing.  Although I've long used solids, it was work getting used to a gel formulation.  If you've had problems with allergic reactions such as rashes, irritation, itching and burnning, please try this product.  Highly recommend!",5
"I've been using the Olay skin care for years and at 60 years of age, get told all the time, that I look much younger.This product applies nicely, has a mild pleasant smell and best of all, really works!I use this at night, and another Olay moisturizer during the day, combined with a BB cream.  I've fought the wrinkles for years, but now Don't forget around the eyes!  Olay has some nice eye creams for that as well.  I honestly believe, that Olay is the best bang for your buck, and works as well and sometimes better than many pricey creams on the market.",5
"I received mine today and tested it out on already-done lashes. It did manage to seperate dried mascara without yanking hair out. It looks white in the pic but its lucite clear with gold sturdy bristles. Its so compact and folds nicely. It is not flimsy and is a handy tool to have to perfect your makeup. I will use on special occasion only, because I'm usually pressed for time and since this is sharp, any type of rushing would take out an eyeball.",4
"i love this brand, i have many other brushes and they are all quality. check them out bc they are worth while. cant beat the price",5
They work well I use them to color in  images  got here way on time then I expected since they ship from Hong Kong,5
"This cleanser is great. Doesnt dry my skin out too much, Controls oil and shine, doesn't induce acne and i think it may be helping my complexion a bit.Thank you to everyone at The Body Shop (: i love this stuff!",5
"Businesses are so misleading these days. They must make an extra kick-a** version of their products and put it into samples then water down the rest to make more of the actual product. Then sell us junk. The sample I tried cleared my skin and was amazingly clean although it seems like the product is pure lard. I was impressed so I searched for the regular sized product and after using it broke out worse than ever. Makes you wonder how organic is this stuff and is there really bees and a guy named burt involved at all? Or just a clever advertiser...It's just not the same as the sample. Smells pretty good though. Instructions very vague (on all their products, it seems).",3
"I have been taking this for three months.  No difference yet.  After reading all the reviews I started these but I have seen nothing yet, I know it says can take up to 6 months.  No greasy hair, no growth, no breakouts, nothing.  Not sure this is going to work for me. I take one a breakfast and one at lunch.  Do not miss.  Not sure about all these great reviews.",3
Don't use this top coat on any nails that have decorations. It takes the paint off as it goes on. Very annoying. Also as it's taking the nail polish off it stains the brush.  I would suggest that you don't purchase this top coat. The base coat is great though and the company was very quick.,2
"After just a few weeks I see a noticeable difference in my jawline, neck and chest. I am using this with a 0.5mm derma roller and several other RevitaLift products. I am very happy with the effectiveness of this product line.",5
"I first learned about this makeup line on YouTube, and decided I was gonna Check it out for myself. I did and I am no way in any shape or form disappointed! The colors are vibrant,they last and they are reasonably priced. For one eye shadow from mack I could get multiple colors from coastal scents! Im now a HUGE fan! I would definitely recommend this product to allll makeup lovers.",5
I bought this along with the scalp cleanser and conditioner and I use this with the two and it works wonders. My hair looks so thick and full and its amazing. I feel my hair is a lot more healthier after using these products.,5
"Love this renewal shampoo! I requested it as my hair is so dry this winter and has lost it's fullness and curl due to the extreme cold outdoors and the dryness from the furnace. (Where is Hawaii when I need it!? Ha!)  The ginseng and tree tea ingredients does repair your hair and the aroma is extremely pleasant. It cleans and returns life to your hair superbly. A wonderful, quality shampoo that gives top quality results.",5
They are really good quality nail files! I'm gonna have these for a long long time!,5
"My daughter has battled with eczema since she was an infant.  We are very limited to the types of soaps, shampoos, and lotions she can use.  In fact, several other brands of eczema lotions and cremes cause her eczema to flair up.  Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Creme actually works for her!I really like this creme, as it goes on thick and lasts for the entire day.  However, it does not clog the skin. It is one of the few products for babies and small children that prevents dry, itchy skin.  It has a very light, pleasant scent, and my daughter's skin looks and feels healthy.Since using the Eucerin Creme, we have used her prescription cream on very few occasions.  I highly recommend this product for babies, children, and adults with eczema.  Even if it seems like you've tried every product and seen little results, give this one a chance--it really works!",4
"I use it as a foot soak and a face mask. I recently bought the Living Clay which can be used internally to detox my body.  Since I cannot use it for internal detox (my main reason for clay), I would not buy it again, but it is good for foot soaks.",4
"I have been using Argan Oil for a year now and love the benefits of it. I love this product, it does exactly what it says,  my skin and hair thank this product for a healthy glow I have!",5
"We think this product worked pretty well. I don't think it compares to a regular shampoo, but it does clean the hair and we will use it when we don't have the time or energy to do the full deal bath.",4
i just fell in love with the color and the product line just has one of the best on the market today for persons who have allergic reactions to cosmetics for it is dermatology approved.,5
"I use this daily after showering and it keeps your legs moist and hydrated all day long, important when you wear skirts :-) I have used this for years and use it daily.",5
"I'm reviewing the Physician's Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free correcting primer in Pink.  I've used Nude before and found it worked well to even out my skin tone.  My skin, which is fair with pink undertones, is showing it's age with some unevenness and even looking a bit tired and dull.  Buying this product in Pink seemed counter intuitive... but it was on sale at a local store for only a few dollars and the Nude was not in stock, so I figured I'd give the Pink a try.I was amazed at the difference in the look of my skin when I applied this product.  It evens out my skin tone as well as the Nude did, and it also visibly brightens.  I used the phrase ""brightens twice"" in my review title because not only does it brighten my skin, but it really brightens my mood, too.  A stroke of the brush, a little blending, and my skin goes from looking like it wants to crawl back under the covers to looking wide awake and lively!Thank goodness I was forced by circumstances to give it a try, because for me it's a perfect product.  It's very lightweight and sheer enough to use alone, so I don't put anything over it except blush (talc-free Physician's Formula).",5
I really enjoyed this product. Feels vey soft on my skin and good quality for the price. I needed this item for my peel and so far I am satisfied with it.,4
"This stuff smells GREAT, and does exactly what it should - which is give you that beach blown, salty look that a lot of people try to avoid.It takes a little practice and patience to find the exact amount to get that tossed look but once you master that it is clear sailing (like what I did there?).Be careful to avoid spraying your eyes since this does in fact contain heavy amounts of salt which you'll regret if you accidentally spray your face!",4
"Although I haven't been using this on my daughter very long I wanted to write a review because I was shocked about how effective this was at helping her dry skin.  I used to use California Baby lotion.  But for some strange reason I had to discontinue use because it was apparently causing a burning sensation to her skin.  My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.  She was in the middle of a breakout when we got this.  After one application her skin was very hydrated and no longer red.  After the second application the eczema was gone.  This lotion is very thick compared to other lotions in a pump bottle.  I would venture to call this a cream rather than a lotion.  The smell is not a typical baby smell, the smell is a bit strong at first but it evaporates quickly leaving a light vanilla scent.  I will update in a couple of months.  PS You can get this A LOT cheaper, shop around.",5
"I got this rather quickly after I ordered it and I must say for the price, it's a fabulous product.  It is not too greasy and gave me good coverage until I need to color again.  I did not notice any rub-off on my clothes either so I much appreciate that.  I have black hair so the black blended in quite nicely - no one could tell that I used the stick.  It's also small like a lipstick so I can take it in my purse whenever I need it.  For the price and the gray coverage it provides, you can't go wrong.",4
"I bought D & G The One because I thought it was just too irresistible. My opinions did not last long though because after a while it became very unbearable, not bad to wear, just not what I like in a perfume. Mom looooooves it though, so there....she gets it :D",3
"I sometimes like to do intricate nail art, but sometimes I will just do a plain one color uniformly across my nail. EITHER WAY I always only do natural nail designs. I really like Seche Vita top coat, but I was not crazy about the base coat, so I tried this. It really works great. I love it! When I painted my nails it dried fast so I could almost immediately put on my color. I am in front of a computer all day for work, so my polish chips very quickly and often I have to change my color 1-2 times a week. Mostly because I have a lot of oils in my nails and polish does not adhere well. But it is day 3 and I have no chips in my nails. My design this week included one color in OPI, one from Essie, and one Sally Hansen insta dry, so they all worked great and I used the Seche Vita top coat. They look perfect. So far so good! My polish applied smoothly and dried looking top notch professional. Love it, Recommend this product.  Will be buying again!",5
"I was seeking a nice, non-oily lotion to soothe my dry hands in this cold winter weather.  I actually had the chance to try before buying (at my local co-op).  The bad part is, I was fooled into thinking this product worked.  It appears to moisturize for about 5 minutes, but I've now come to realize that after those few, spare minutes, I must reapply.  It leaves a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes me think that the ingredients aren't being absorbed.  My skin still feels very dry.  The fragrance is simply OVERPOWERING.  I love patchouli, and I even bought the lavender scented lotion, and they are both extremely loud - some of the most highly scented perfumes I have ever used.  The first time I applied it at home, my boyfriend asked if I had sprayed perfume.  I am so very disappointed in this product.  Never again will I purchase anything from Dr. Bronner's.  I think there is so much fragrance in this, it is actually stinging my skin.",1
"These don't cost much, but they shouldn't -- they fall apart really easily. They can be glued back together, but it'd be nice to not have to almost immediately repair new items.",2
I have really sensitive skin and I am loving this moisturizer/sunscreen.  It is great to find it regularly on Amazon- will order again.,5
My cousin loves this oil and told me about it.  I found it here at Amazon a lot cheaper then what she paid at the regular store.  I ordered it based on her recommendation.  I was not impressed with it.  I saw her yesterday and gave it to her.  She was very happy.  I guess its not for everyone.,3
"I love this shampoo and the matching conditioner! I had to find something organic for a camping trip. At first, I tried the Dr. Bronner's castile soap & Shikakai hair rinse, which my hair absolutely hated. On my second try, I found this! It's lightweight, but also keeps my hair moisturized enough, which is no easy task - I have fine (thin strands), but thick (a LOT of them) hair, so it tends to get weighted down and fall flat...but it also dries out easily...but it also looks greasy within a day of not washing. Super annoying!With this shampoo and the conditioner, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering. Then when we went camping, we got burglarized of about 75% of our stuff, including this, so I got to test how well the effects lasted for 4 days. By the last day, I did feel gross, but not nearly as bad as it would have been with my regular s & c!",5
"I like this mirror - better than my last one, because it gives you the choice of a normal mirror or flipping it to the magnified mirror.  I think it is lit pretty well, my last one was a little brighter, but this one does great for me.  I do very much like the oiled bronze look of the metal - fits our decor well without sticking out like a sore thumb.  Also, liked the fact that there is an extra outlet located on the back of the mirror (so you use a plug to light the mirror, but also gain a an outlet to plug something into the back of the mirror)- I did not remember reading it had this at the time I purchased - very nice surprise!  Overall, I like the mirror and would more than likely purchase again.",4
Beautiful color and makes your face glow! It last a very long time as well and it comes with a pretty brush to apply it with :),5
"I have very dry red hair.  I use sulfate free conditioning cleansers and only ""wash"" my hair once every 6 - 8 days.  During the winter my hair can get static electricity and looses some of its shine.  I do not like to use regular gloss or shin products because of the heavy alcohol content, flammability and fact that no matter how long I let the products dry when I comb my hair again they leave it looking greasy.  This product helps with the fly-way static and puts the shine back in my hair but it is not greasy after it dries.  I also think this product has improved the condition of my hair unlike a much more expensive product that made my hair fall out.  This product lasts a long time and I have used it very liberally for over a month and you can barely tell there is any less in the bottle.  Very happy and will buy this over and over again.",5
"This shampoo says that it has ""vitamins and nutrients formulated to improve the strength and appearance of hair. For frizzy and hard-to-manage locks, this shampoo provides 24-hour frizz control"".When I first used it, it was a very windy day and I have to admit that there seemed to be less of a `halo' of loose hair around my head when I came inside, but other than that one day, it seems to be no different from any other shampoos that I use, many of which are less expensive per ounce.The exception is the bottle. It seems to be made so that you can stand it upside down so that you can get all of the shampoo out. That is great with the exception that it then leaks a bit and you wind up with the bottle standing in a pool of slippery shampoo.",3
"I have tried other pain relievers for my PMS, with minimal to no results.  Pamprin Multi-Symptom is the ONLY drug that works to completely relieve all of my intense cramps during my period.  The pain level of my cramps at times can be so intense that it's hard to focus on anything, but Pamprin makes it so I can get through my day without pain.  The only downside is that it can make me very sleepy, so I try to only take it when I'm at home.  This Pamprin also helps to alleviate bloating and irritability.  I don't recommend the other Pamprin brands that have caffeine in them as any caffeine seems to exacerbate my cramps for some reason (always has).",5
"It is a perfume normal, typical for a modest gift without much fanfare. Any woman would like, but not the favorite ever.",3
"This mask is thick and yes it does look like mud.I love the fact that it is made with all natural, organic ingredients.I'm using the mask as I type this. I will then shower afterward and show a picture of my skin.It is very easy to apply on your skin. It has a strong Eucalyptus scent. Make sure to avoid your eyes and mouth. It can irritate if you it in your eyes!I like the scent, but like I said, it is strong.It feels very tingly and cool on my face. I love this feeling!I put the mask on thickly, and avoid talking or moving my mouth, so that the mask won't settle in any lines. I leave it on for 10-15 minutes and it dries and there is a tightening feeling on my skin.I find it easiest to shower after using this mask to remove it. My skin feels so nice afterwards. I love this mask so much. My face feels refreshed, clean, and invigorated. It works so well to reduce any inflammation/redness on my skin, helps to clear up the acne, and just leaves it looking better. It also feels even smoother and softer than before.I have been using it once a week as instructed and the results are excellent. I actually look forward to using it every week because it does feel really, really good. So much cheaper than going to a spa/salon to get a Dead Sea Mud Facial! Highly recommended.Please do make sure to wash it completely off your hands though so that you don't get it in your eyes!",5
"Here again you use the word pen and brushes in the same sentence.  They do work okay, but not as I anticipated.",3
love the materialit is very good for your skini bet every one would like this kind of stuff hahaha,5
"I was introduced to this hairspray by a friend who has her cosmetology license. I fell in love and am so happy it is available to those who don't live by a salon that sells it. My favorite thing about this hairspray is its ability to hold your hair in place ALL day yet not feel sticky or hard. It is VERY easy to work with once on your hair which is something I have never experienced with any other hairspray! It is flexible and does not turn hard. Mistakes are easy to fix with this stuff :)I also am a big ""back-comber"" and for making really huge volume, this hairspray doesn't let you down. It's almost unbelievable what it can do to your hair. I have fine hair, but a lot of it. I go through cans and cans of this spray! It is really worth the few extra bucks.*To get super textured hair that is puffy with a lot of volume, I combine with ""OSIS-TEX IT"" Bodyfier Gel by Schwarzkopf. This lethal combination turns fine hair into thick, voluminous hair. I &lt;3 it",5
"I use this wonderful cleansing oil along with my Olay Sensitive cloths.  I love how it feels; it gets off your makeup quickly; it rinses easily; and it does not leave your face feeling tight.  Also, there is no weird smell.",5
"I've been using this for several months now. One bottle lasts me almost a month and I use it every morning on my entire face. Two pumps, and it's enough to soothe, nourish, and moisturize my skin. My skin looks remarkably young for my age and just yesterday a woman was commenting on my beautiful porcelain skin. No one believes I'm in my forties. Believe it or not, I had terrible skin all the way until my mid 30's and since using this serum I swear my skin has reversed it's aging process and looks young & smooth. I also useYes To Blueberries Intensive Skin Repair Serum, 1-Fluid Ounceat night and at least once a week useAztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbsmask with vinegar. I highly recommend this regimen along with mineral make up for very clear, flawless looking skin.",5
"It is a nice texture cream, takes only a small amount and the cream is nice, odor free and rubs in well without leaving any greasy feel.  I will review after I have used this a while with results.  Menopause is not fun!!  I will admit so far there are no hot flashes waking me up at night!",3
"I have very light eyelashes and it's hard for me to find the perfect mascara, UNTIL NOW!  THIS IS IT LADIES!  It doesn't extend your lashes, it just makes them look like perfect eyelashes that dolls do!  I look the shape of the applicator and how easy it is to apply.  It goes on SUPER SMOOTH and you can double coat without waiting!  Lasts ALL DAY LONG.  Not waterproof, but doesn't flake or smear.  I have slept in this stuff and woke up with PERFECT LASHES!!!!  Get one for you and one for a gift, you will wish you did!",5
"I tried out theSuave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo, 22.5 Ounceand I was shocked at what a great bargain it was--you get a giant bottle of decent shampoo for very little money.  Of course, the natural companion is the ""Rainforest Fresh Conditioner,"" so that's what I tried next.Just like the shampoo, the conditioner is infused with aloe and bamboo (And again, I'm not sure what good bamboo is supposed to do for your skin, other than to sound exotic on the packaging).  The smell is the Yankee Candle version of ""Rainforest Fresh"" and smells nothing like an actual rainforest or an actual bamboo forest.  The best I can say is that it smells ""green,"" and is a pleasant enough way to start your morning.It isn't a powerful conditioner.  I have short hair, so it does the trick for me, but my wife has super-long, think Asian hair and she wasn't a fan of this conditioner. It's too light to get the job done on hair that really needs it.",4
"The nice smell of this Suave Infusion, Macadamia Oil and White Orchid,  goes specifically with one of the Siave line of shampoos.  However, it is great just to add to your collection of products in dry winter weather, as it lightly moisturizes and lightly controls, with a light yet very pleasant scent. No, I didn't bet any of my friends I could use the word &#34;light&#34; in this review a certain number of times...but it is truly is NOT a heavy greasy product, and it doesn't add a lot of extra &#34;anything&#34; to the finishing touches which you make on your hair. Some days, that is just enough.Perhaps you will be as &#34;delighted&#34; with the subtle nature and nice smell as I am!",5
This shampoo has a creamier texture than most and leaves your hair feeling clean.  It leaves the hair feeling and looking good.  It is certainly an excellent choice.,5
Nice color but this gloss is very sticky which is not very appealing to me and I don't think it really last that long. I suggest getting the maybeline 24hr lipcolor instead.,3
"I am not impressed with the UBU Super Softy Extra Large and Soft Powder Brush.  Its bristles are not as soft as one would expect--especially since the word, 'soft' is in the product's name not once, but twice.  They began to shed once the brush was removed from its packaging (a cheap plastic zip top bag).  To work on one's face, there should be attention paid to ergonomic design.  It lacks both a tapered brush and a handle that feels comfortable.  This one is simply clunky and bulky.While the brush is not expensive, there are competitors out there with superior products that cost less (and some, more) than this one.  I cannot recommend the brush, nor will I buy UBU products in the future.",2
"This mascara is one of the best I've found--and I'm pretty picky about my mascara! It goes on without clumping and definitely makes my lashes look longer. (It doesn't make them look thicker, though, which is why it only gets 4 stars.) I especially like that it doesn't flake off or leave marks under my eyes. My lashes also feel soft--not at all stiff like some mascaras leave them. It washes off easily at the end of the day. And the price is quite comparable to other mascaras. Overall, it's a great deal!",4
"While they feathers are vibrant in color they weren't as long as I expected for my hair. The feathers are soft yet 2 feathers tore pretty easily. Wish there was an assortment of colors for the beads, but the colors it came in fit perfectly for my dark brown/black hair",3
This does absolutely nothing.  the reviews must have been placed by paid people becaus ethere is no way real customers posted them.  This product is like water in a seringe.  Do not waste your money.,1
"These brushes are super soft and pretty. They work great, I haven't noticed and shedding so far, I've had them for a few weeks now. I think that my only complaint is that a lost of the brushes, like the foundation/powder brush, and the one I use for contouring have super short handles. My fault though for not noticing that when I bought them. I do love them, and could see how the short handles would be great if you used these brushes for traveling.",4
My daughter and I both love this product when applied to wet hair before combing after washing our hair.  It gives a wonderul shine and bounce.  We live in Florida which naturally is very humid especially during warm/hot months.  It does help with frizziness until the next shampoo.This product is on the Top 10 Hair Products Awards.,4
"This product is so wonderful and refreshing to my curls!!! It adds zeal, life, and luster to my curls!!! It's a nice way to refreshing the texture of my curls during a humid day!!&iexcl;",5
I don't care what the drugstore serums say on the packaging.  If you want an excellent product you have to pay for it (more often than not).  This serum fights the frizz exceptionally well.  I live in the tropics where the humidity is unbridled and only punctuated by bouts of rain (hurricanes etc.)  When I flat iron my hair with this it doesn't feel fried like it would with other products AND when it rains I don't have to dash for cover.  It gets my hair super straights and very shiny.  I have been using this shine serum for about three years now.  Obsessed with it!,5
"These brushes are travel size. I like them, but I imagined they would be bigger. The looks of them are similar to the picture but there is no white on the bristles, as shown it looks white and then neon orange, well it's not. It's more like a grande effect of light pink/orange into a deeper orange. They work well enough, but these are just average makeup brushes there isn't anything special about them. I gave it three stars because the colors are different and because they are travel size.",3
"10 Minutes after our 10 yr. old got her &#34;Salon&#34; for Christmas, 3/4 of a bottle of nail polish was gone and the house smelled horrible. Once I showed her how to touch up with these pens we can breathe again. They can be refilled easy so it is a great solution for the mistakes.",5
"Love these! They are just thick enough to boost up your natural lash without looking ridiculous. I cut them in 1/2 and use 1 pair on my eyes as an accent lash application. They look great and the price is AMAZING!! It took a while to receive, but for the price they were worth the wait, and when they arrived after I realized how incredible they were I turned around and bought another box right away to ensure they would arrive long before these would be used up. Ordering two boxes next time, I wear them daily and get compliments all the time, and no one knows they aren't my real lashes.",5
"I was expecting for this cruelty free nail polish remover to work less well, it actually works better than a $2 bottle of remover from the drug store. I also thought I was going to have to use more of it to get the polish off - wrong again, I actually had to use less. This was with non cruelty free nail polish - so I bet it will be even better with the cruelty free nail polish. Worth the extra money in my opinion, and left my hands feeling nice and soft, instead of dryed out and brittle.",5
I'm still on the hunt for the red you see on the starlets and I still can't seem to find one I like.  After the second coat this seemed to go darker rather than brighter which is what I was hoping for.,4
"This has a stronger scent than I would expect from a Dove product but it lessened once I used it with water and washed up. It feels nice and does a good job.As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has ""purifying grains.""This feels great on my skin and leaves a clean smell after use. I really like this.",5
"As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this product for review.So far, I've given one to my wife for her legs and used another for my own shaving needs.  It delivers a good shave thus far, both dry and using shaving cream.  The head moves around my chin and does a nice job of picking up the stubble that my electric shaver misses.  The list price of (currently) 8.99 is a bit pricey for disposable razors, but thus far I haven't disposed of any of them, so they get marks for durability.I recommend this product.  Razors are necessary items and a package of these can often help you get up to the Free Shipping point.",4
"Too dark and purple for me.  Some will love it.  I just don't happen to care for the color.  Gelish polish is a good product, though.",3
"When I get pore cleansing strips, I always get Biore Ultra Deep. The Ultra Deep do a better job than the regular, though they are a bit harsher. They are easy to use: Get them wet, put them carefully on your nose -- make sure you press down into the seam between your nose and cheek -- then wait until they dry. When you pull them off, do so somewhat slowly. You can see all the blackheads and clogged pores you pulled out, they will be stuck to the strip.My nose has always had enlarged, often clogged pores, and all over the nose. Pretty much every pore is a problem. These strips have been tremendous in helping me control that. My only quibble is that they are not always effective. Sometimes I will see entire spots on the strip which pulled out nothing, yet you can see on my nose that the strip should have grabbed onto something and removed it. But sometimes I use a strip and it gets literally everything. Every so often, some of the sticky side of the strip is left behind on my skin, so I have to get some astringent to wipe it off because it's quite difficult to remove.I also don't recommend using these more than once a week, because they can be harsh. Overall, I will keep using these, but do wish they were just a little more consistent.",4
"Fragrance free, if that is important to you.It has a nice texture and rinses off easily.Not sure about the age defying claims.At some point, I really don't want to pay more than $7 or 8 dollars on refined soap.The company is based in San Francisco, and not in Los Angeles, if that matters to you.  The product hence is a little bit off the beaten path.  But the question is, do you care that much.  I don't.  I just care that it doesn't smell perfumy.",5
"Smells really nice, and it works great on bug problems. I use it in baths and with lotions. It makes my skin feel smoother too.",5
"Slowly trying to replace cosmetics with parabens with those without.  This is light, cleans great, don't leave my hands super dry.  It's my favorite hand soap.  I almost want to sneak in a bottle just for work. :D",5
"It cleans nicely. Smell is soft and discrete. Leaves my face feeling clean and not dry. Even my sensitive no smell dove soap leaves my face feeling dry. This product doesn't. I have ordered two so far. I know i could go buy them in a store, but really enjoy shopping here and they just show up at my door:P",5
"I could only get one lash on.  It looked great.  The other one wouldn't bend to my eye shape.  The black line is distracting.  For the same price I got individual short flared brown lashes.  Permalash.  I am happy I got these, because I really like the look of lashes, since I haven't used them for 40 years. I haven't used the new ones yet, but they look awesome!UPDATE!  Permalash wins by a mile!  You can put as many or as few as you prefer, and the trick is to slant them out a bit.  I put 4 on each eye.  Read the instructions, and be ever so careful!",4
I have ordered this color several times.  It works great as a base to stamp on or as a stamping color.  I have also worn it on my toes as a solo color.  LOVE this,5
I can not believe how good these are. They are made so well! And the price for them should cost a whole lot more in my opinion. (Now that I have them haha) I'm very pleased with these as a pair.,5
"I have been using this mascara for YEARS. I literally cried when they discontinued it and bought a massive shipment of it online and am glad to see it here on Amazon. No other mascara comes close to this in my opinion, I have tried many others but have not switched in over a decade.

"This elixer is ok but my hair needs more love and care, so I just went on and brought the real thing 100% Argan oil. I was looking for something to help me with the breakage that I was having.I wash, condition and put in a leave in condition (now). I blow dry my hair and flat iron it once a week. Ever since I used 100% argan oil my hair has not been breaking. This product might be good for someone who has healthy hair. When I put this in my hair it seems its like it evaporated and the sheen is gone in few moments after I apply it.I gave it 2 stars because the bottle is adorable. But it could have came in a plastic water bottle as long as it helped with my hair :0)",2
"I have very very sensitive skin.  I wanted to test this out to see if it worked for me - or does what most skin care products do (which is a nasty break out).  The answer, Bio-Oil makes me break out.  I'm sorry to say that if your skin is even slightly sensitive, I wouldn't use this product.  As a side note, I let a girlfriend who is pregnant use some and she said that she thinks it is working well for stretch marks.",2
"My son is getting married in a couple of weeks and I am doing everything in my power to step it up for the festivities. I have a lot of broken capillaries around my nostrils and a lot of redness on my cheeks. I use Bare Minerals products, but the concealer doesn't completely cover all the redness and it also wears off way sooner than I feel it should. I ran across this product on Amazon and thought it was worth a try. I am so glad I did. I should have been a research scientist because I don't buy anything until I have read everything I can find about the product prior to my money leaving my hand. As a result of this I landed at the IT Cosmetics websight and ended up purchasing there. They offer a discount if you sign up and it saved me about six dollars along with free shipping. But this is a bargain at any price.Make sure to use a very small amount. I patted the cream on the reddest parts of my face....the end. No foundation, no powder, nothing! I wanted to make sure it does not crease or wear off, and make sure the cream is doing what it is suppose to. It DOES!!!!! It hid my redness all day long, to the point that my husband said I looked pale (hours later) because he was so accustomed to my RED face. I really think this would work well as a concealer or a foundation. I love this product.",5

"Review of Own Products Rejuvenating Facial Cleaner.  I received this product from the Vine Program in exchange for an honest review.  This product claims to be an ""anti-aging rejuvenating cleanser"" which features a ""light and creamy non-foaming formula that revitalizes your skin for a fresher looking you.""  In addition the product claims that it was ""developed with glycolic acid and vitamin E ... [which] gently exfoliates and preps skin for maximum results when combined with Own's Anti-Aging line product.""  My wife reported that the product is odorless but does provide a low level of stimulation on the skin no doubt in part of the exfoliation process.  She stated that her skin felt clean and fresh.  4 Stars for rejuvenation.",4
"I have been using gelish for about a year now and I normally just do a color nail polish. I've been wanting to try the french manicure by gelish for some time now and I'm glad I did. This is the perfect white to do this. I read through other reviews to make my decision and I'm glad I took their advice. It does need about 2 coats to become the perfect white. Make sure you apply it in thin layers because it tends to bubble up a bit. I put a foundation gel first, then cure it, then one coat of white, clean it up with brush, cure it, then another coat, clean it up with brush and then cure it again.Then I put Simply Sheer over the top and cure it again. I also use the Top coat by gelish for this.",5
It is gentle enough it wont cause irritation or pre peel but the scrublet is cleansing enough to remove dead skin.,5
"This is supposed to do many wonderful things. ""Looks like makeup, acts like skincare.""Sort of. It has a tint that blended well with my complexion. Also, I really like that the SPF is 40 because I need to protect my skin when I'm outside.However, the product also claims to be an anti-aging moisturizer that will reduce lines, wrinkles, and skin aging. As far as I can tell, the only way it'll help in this department is with the sunscreen. I use an Olay anti-aging moisturizer product to counteract skin aging, and I've been thrilled with it. This product can't compete with that.I've been using a Neutrogena product as a sunscreen, but I'm leaning towards replacing it with this one because of the higher SPF. But it is not, despite the high cost, something I would consider replacing the Olay with.",4
"I don't typically believe the hype in products like blow dryers, as I figure hot air is hot air.  I have hair a little longer than shoulder length and the front is layered.  I've always had straight, fine hair - but some of my hair has begun to lose its pigment and has become more coarse and wiry.  After using this blow dryer, my hair hung straighter and flatter - and seemed to have more shine.  It was like the fountain of youth for my hair, turning back time before my hair started on the progression toward gray hair!  My husband has more gray and difficulty controlling it, so he's going to try it next to see if it might help in taming his hair a bit.I believe it did dry my hair faster, but what was surprising to me was that the air seemed cooler than most blow dryers I've used in the past. I haven't yet experimented with using the volumizer to see if I might be able to combine the taming of the wiry hair with styling to give a bit of lift at the top, but will try that next and report my findings.  My hair responded less to my attempt to slightly curl the ends with a round brush during the blow drying than it does with theConair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer (Wine)that I've been using (a great but hefty blow dryer).This is a surprisingly lightweight blow dryer for its size, which is approximately 9.5 inches from the base to the tip, handle approximately 5.5 inches long and a cord that's about 67 inches in length.Overall, a blow dryer that dries fast but not too hot.  Whether you'll like this blow dryer may depend on what you're looking for in styling results.  If my hair is any indication, you can reduce frizz, and your hair will be straighter, flatter and possibly more shiny after using it.",4
"I purchased these when I decided to adopt the Japanese protocol of facial care. They are great, and although small even when stretched, I found that I can separate them in more layers than they are supposed to be. Happy with my purchase so far! No cotton residues are left behind, and the absorption is excellent: in other words, in my opinion they are great.",5

"Master Review For Both Vitamin C Serum, and Hyaluronic Serum.Product Overviews: The products both work with initial contact. They both smooth your skin, and give you a slight natural glow. The Hya. Serum is very thick and slightly sticky, but nice. It is easy to spread, and will last a long time. You only need a drop or two. The Vitamin C serum, however, is very watery and not very spreadable, and I found myself having to use a lot. It will probably run out 3x as fast as the Hya. Serum. They did not irritate my skin at all, and had a nice light scent. I will update this review in the future, with further details of long term usage on skin, for both me, 18yrs old, and my mother, 50yrs old, to report on the effects for both young and old skin.Packaging: The packaging was good. A flip up cardboard box, which encased the two bottles wrapped in a light amount of bubble wrap. I think the bottles would be much safer in their own boxes though, because they easily could have been damaged during the handling process if it was handled by a clumsy postman. Each also came with a 25% off coupon.Customer Service: The customer service for this company is A+. I annoyed them purposely. I emailed them at least three times in the week they were shipping, just asking how to order, why the shipping wasn't working, why my package was in a town for so long, etc. But they always responded within 24 hours of my inquiry, and were polite and thorough in helping me out, and making sure I was satisfied. This was very comforting. There are many companies who simply ignore customers who ask a lot of questions.Pros Of Hya Serum:ThickOnly need a littlePleasant smellHydrates skinMakes your skin look smoothCons Of Hya Serum:StickyWhen it dries, you kinda get that feeling like when a face mask dries on your skin.Pros Of Vitamin C Serum:Hydrates SkinMakes your skin look smoothPleasant smellCons Of Vitamin C SerumThin and wateryDoesn't spread at all on skinNeed to use a vast amount to cover face((TO BE UPDATED AT A FUTURE DATE AFTER PROLONGED USE))",4
"I have only used this product twice, so I'm not sure what to think just yet.  This is the smallest needled roller and it's quite uncomfortable, especially on my chest area, even when rolling very lightly.  If it does work, I'll have to come back to augment this review with a &#34;results&#34; message.  I'm going to have to build up a tolerance for it, which may take some time.",3
"I've wasted plenty of money on moisturizing lotions that I use once and throw away. The one thing I'm looking for in a cream is that it not be sticky. Amazingly hard to find -- two that I've recently discarded (or downgraded to foot creams) areAveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer SPF 15andNivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion. I bought a travel size of this Lubriderm and absolutely love it. It completely blends in, leaving no sticky or greasy feeling. And it works on dry, winter skin.",5
"After reading the reviews and seeing the price, I decided I really had nothing to worry about.  If it didn't work, I'd only be out a few dollars.  Well... I am out those few dollars.  I used it nightly for approximately 2 months, on my lashes and brows, but nothing!  And I mean NOTHING!  No new growth in my eyebrows at all.  There was also no difference in my lashes, no new growth, no increase in length or fullness - nothing.  Unfortunately, this product didn't help me at all.  But with so many positive reviews and such an inexpensive price, it still may be worth a try for most.  Good luck!",1
"I don't remember exactly when I purchased these from Amazon, but I absolutely love these! I compared price on a lot of the websites for these, and believed this is the best value. Not only I got all 11 colors, they were nicely packed, but also a great deal. I love the texture on these lip cream. I am a lipstick person, and don't wear lipgloss. These come in lipgloss like tubes with the sponge applicators. I have quite dry lips, and you would think matte lip products will make them worse. Not these ones! The texture is velvety, and they go on very smoothly. They are not hydrating, but non-drying, either. The color payoff on these are the same as what you see of the tube colors. True to color! They blend out nice, super light-weight, long-lasting, comfortable wear, and have great portable size. The range of colors are nice as well. The collection offers nudes, neutrals, pinks, berry, to reds. I like how all the colors in this collection are wearable except for the ultra nudes, but these are great for layering. You can simply top of the nudes with another color to blend your custom shades, or with a sheer colored lip gloss to tone down the pale nudes. I love these mainly for the velvety smooth texture and the comfort long-lasting quality. I think NYX just came out with few more new shades for their soft matte lip cream, so you will actually get more variety of colors such as corals and peaches. I think whether you are a lipstick gal or a gloss lady, you will love NYX soft matte lip cream!For products reviews and makeup tutorials, please visit my Youtube channel: Theartofsign",5
"This trio is beautifully packaged -- nice enough to leave out on a bathroom shelf.  The name of this trio seems a bit pompous and overblown; the kit includes a daytime moisturizer with an SP-30 factor, a very light and non-greasy cream for overnight and a tube for the extra problem lines.  The creams all feel good on the skin and not at all greasy or thick.  I use the daytime cream under my makeup and it provides a very nice matte foundation.  In my view, these kits  can be used and enjoyed by both men and women.",5
Im so happy because I had the opportunity to review Belitae Organics FRESH Vitamin C Serum recently and I love the results. Bellitae Organics is an excellent skin care product that is formulated for all skin types and to have a flawless glowing skin.Im a true fan of this product because it has an active ingredient called STAY-C 50 and its a very potent antioxidant that absorbs into your skin instantly leaving no residue. A week later my skin felt smoother and looked brighter. I do recommend this product its for all skin types.  #AD #tomoson,5
"The first thing that you notice about Axe's shave gel is the packaging; it's a sci-fi looking bottle with bubbles frozen in time. It looks like a movie prop from Resident Evil or something.The gel itself does what it says on the box, it cools and hydrates and I felt it aided my shave immensely. And added bonus is the scent is not over-powering but gives just enough refreshing odor to your shave.Ace product in a space-age package!",5
"I use a lot of Axe products so when I got the chance to grab one that I haven't tried before I jumped at it.Upon opening the package I noted that there's a significant amount of product here. As with other Axe shower washes this is a big BIG bottle and so for the money you can't complain on that front.The aroma is strong with this one, not unpleasant though and a little fruity. Very nice, especially compared to some other axe products such as their cool metal shampoo which at best can be described as smelling strange.Now this is a true gel and it caught me off guard; I squished some in my already wet hand and the whole lot sloughed off and ran down the drain leaving naught residue. It escaped! Yes, this is very slippy stuff and you have to lather it up before randomly chucking it on your body as I tend to do.Once again Axe provides a great product, smells good, cleans well and you get a good amount at what I consider a very reasonable price.",5

"I just received and the opening is quite small compared to my UV Lamp.  I have small hands (ring size 5-6) and I feel like I have to group my fingers together to get them into the opening safely.  I plan to try it in the next two weeks and then I'll decide whether to keep or not.  The price is good and it was delivered early.Update:  10/12/13 (went from 4 stars to 3) one for small opening and one for short cord.I'll keep it but now that I've used it I'd like to offer a few more comments.  I do feel cramped with the very small opening and don't feel as though I can lay my fingers flat.  I feel the heat from the LEDs on my middle 3 fingers as I try to place my fingers totally in the opening (my fingers are long for my small hands, but normal and my nails are short at this time, usually they're long.My other concern is the very short cord, only 3 feet and I can barely use the Lamp because my plug is on the floor and my desk is normal height and it barely makes it.  Again, I'm feeling very cramped (inside with small opening and outside with short cord).  I'm trying to see if I can purchase another cord of longer length because that alone will keep me from using this lamp as much as my UV Lamp.It's good to have a spare, it's easy to use and I'll be switching between my UV Lamp and my LED Lamp as I'm not sure end product is any different.  I never felt the heat like this with my UV Lamp.",3
"This has to be the worst mascara I've ever used.  It makes lashes limp and clumpy, does not separate lashes or work with a curler whatsoever.  I'm very disappointed.",1

This is a nice cleanser for oily skin. I use it daily and my skin feels great. I also got a great price through Amazon!,5
"The first two vitamin c serums I had tried were just a murky liquid that clogged my pores.  Upon first application, I loved that this serum actually reminded me of oranges, based on the smell and color, as this is what comes to mind when I think of vitamin C.  I was scared when applying it that I would have clogged pores the next day and I didn't!  I tried applying it with my moisturizer afterwards and still did not have clogged pores.  It instantly tightens the skin, which you can physically feel, and leaves your skin plumper and brighter.  I like to apply this in the morning before makeup for the glow it gives me.",5
"I ended up with this in Natural Ivory because my teenage daughter said that it was too dark a shade for her skin.  I would normally wear light or classic beige and this foundation works for me in natural ivory. It goes on very smoothly with the sponge applicator.  I haven't tried applying it with my finger tips as of yet.  I do find, however, that I feel the need to add some blush and powder to finish the look otherwise my face is basically a blank palette.I am just over 50, and I still end up with a somewhat oily forehead and nose when I use this, so it doesn't seem to absorb any oil.  It is very comfortable to wear and it doesn't irritate my skin at all.",4
"This hairspray deserves to have five stars. I remember first using it years ago, sense the smell of it takes me back. It smells so good, I sometimes have to stop myself from over spraying. It has a nice, light hold but I wouldn't count it as a strong hold hairspray. Even if you spray a lot. I would deeply miss it if I couldn't buy it anymore.",5
"This serum is a winner.  My skin loves these three ingredients: E, C and HA.  The price was right for such a power-packed serum.It's nice to have one serum for all three.",5
"Best lotion, foundation, sunblock combo ever.  Not greasy like other SPF lotions, but works amazingly! I love this lotion.  I'm allergic to other SPF lotions. I can't use them on my face with every pore burning when I sweat.  This lotion is perfect. No burning at all and I don't get burnt.  It's hard to believe that everybody doesn't use this product. It feels so soft and blend right into my skin covering marks and blemishes like a light foundation. It blend in when I have  tan and when I am pale.  It just matches my skin no matter what shade It is.  It is an amazing product. Thank you Tizo Solar Protection Formula, Facial Mineral Fusion SPF 40!",5
I bought this for a friend as a gift.  She loves it.  The color is nice and Essie is a good brand of nail polish.,5
Picks up image and transfer nicely. I have only played around with it the stamp and have done some experimenting. Mani and Pedi should be a breeze.,5
"I love this product!  I've been using Oil of Olay since I was a teenager and dinosaurs roamed the earth. Oil of Olay has consistently been a great product all that time. But, my Oil of Olay disappeared from my area, so I bought this to try. I love it. It goes on smooth and creamy, not oily. It is unscented. Only one squirt is all you need to keep your face nourished and comfortable all day.",5
"Really a professional grade product. Both the Monoi and super-fashionable Moroccan oil absolutely provide a slick, and, dare I say, glossy hair experience. Worth it!",5
"I was not expecting much from this product. I have very damaged hair from years of coloring and daily heat styling. It's dull (no shine at all), breaks off, and is very dry. I've tried lots of products but get only mediocre results due to the bad condition of my hair. This product, however, is amazing!! I've used it twice, and it's nearly transformed my hair. It's shiny, soft, hydrated, and it looks so healthy. I will be recommending this to all my hair-abusing friends, and stocking up for myself. And I'll definitely be trying the other products in this line.",5
"I always love my Olay products! I have used it for years and will continue to use forever. I believe it makes my complexion glow, as, I get many compliments on it. At age 69 I can tell compared to others my age and skin type it is a winner. I will recommend to friends when they ask me what I use.",5
Great soap and my kids love it too. You can find this in any store really but love being able to buy in bulk on amazon.,5
"Best shea butter I have ever used!  I have tried the yellow shea like most Americans, but I read how it is processed and mixed with unknown chemicals.  I am a bit fearful when products can be sold and you have no idea what's in it.  This shea is like no other I have ever used.  It is light in color, just like the photo.  It is creamy and melts into my hands without having to heat it up.  I will only order this one in the future.  Thanks Coastal Scents for offering such a good wholesome product.  I have family with very sensitive skin so I will be giving them some of my product and referring them to you!",5
"This product smells great, and leaves me smelling faintly soap like (in a good way).  Not flowery or anything like that, just clean.  I keep it in my gym bag, and wash my hair with it after working out.  As the foam comes off my hair, I use it on my body.  It works great and is very convenient for places like the gym.",5
"First off let me start by saying I have tried numerous different facial moisturizers and tend to be a little obsessive when it comes to skin care.  I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now off and on.  It has been off and on because I like to try new and different products, and I always come back to this one.The product is very light and creamy.  It has not caused any oily feelings or break outs, and provides ample moisture for the day.  I tend to have very dry skin but can also get the monstrous zit here and there.  This keeps my face moisturized all day and feels wonderful on my skin.  When I use it consistently I can notice a difference as far as the fine lines around my eyes, ""crow's feet"", and most mornings I can notice an immediate difference in the texture of my skin.  It isn't too heavily scented and has become my go to daily moisturizer.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially at this price on Amazon.com.",5
"I traded in my thin model for this wider plated model and I am happy with the results.  I have long hair, mid back length and I was using a thinner flat iron, which took longer.  I find with the wider plates, I am done sooner with the process and my hair looks and feels fantastic.  It also has adjustable temps and a swivel cord.  It heats up quickly, which I really like not having to wait around and the price is priced right for the quality.",5
"I've only used it once since I received it but I really like how my hair turned out. Silky smooths and bouncy. Lock the screen and its fantastic. Can't beat the results for the price.Will update review once I've had it for a while.Update: 5/20/13I have had this for about a month and let me tell you I love it. I am blowdrying my hair with ( Infiniti by Conair SD8R Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black) and the flat ironing it. The results continue to be fantastic. My hair is very shiny and soft. I use at the 300 setting because that's plenty hot.The one thing I would change :  it may be me but it seems to take longer than 30 seconds to preheat and after reaching the 30 sec mark it cuts off. That's slightly annoying, once I had to turn it back on 3 times in a row but oh we'll that's not the worse thing in the world.",5
"I typically love this product. However, when I received this stick, the product had metled and re-hardend; rendering it impossible to use. The product just flakes out of the tube.",2
I've never permed my hair before. So I picked this one because it said it was recommended for never been permed hair. I had a hair stylist friend put it on for me with 3 different sized rollers hoping for a nice body wave at least. Followed directions exactly. It burned my scalp and did not even give my hair body. Very disappointed. Not to mention the 2 weeks of flakey scalp from the burn. So embarrassing.,1
"I've been using this product on a burn scar for about a month and it seems to have improved the look of the scar. I heal horribly, but this scar is already smaller and less noticeable.Some people may not love the smell of Bio-Oil, but I adore it. It's soft and cinnamon-y. The oil itself is thin and rubs in easily without feeling greasy.My only complaint is that I received an unboxed bottle. Because of this, I have no way of verifying that the product is legit/untampered.",4
"A great tool. Now I can do salon level affects on my nails without paying salon prices. Easy to use, easy to clean.",4
"Jojoba Oil has become one of my favorite products. Winter left my hands red and dry. After the first application of Jojoba Oil, my hands felt silky and supple. Even coconut oil could not touch the dryness of my hands. The Jojoba Oil absorbed quickly and worked instantly. After a few days, the skin on my hands felt young and supple.I have even been using Jojoba Oil to moisturize my face and my legs. I love that the Jojoba Oil absorbs quickly and does leave a greasy feeling on my skin.Jojoba Oil is a great carrier oil for essential oils. I mixed a small dark amber colored bottle of organic Jojoba Oil and organic lavender oil as a relaxing moisturizer to keep in the diaper bag. Since Jojoba Oil is organic and pure, I feel comfortable using it on my baby's skin to relieve redness from diapers or to moisturize dry patches.I would highly recommend Leven Rose's 100% organic Jojoba Oil. Jojoba Oil is truly liquid gold for your skin. One little bottle will work magic all over your body (skin, hair and nails). Jojoba Oil is a great addition to your beauty care routine.",5
"I herd of this from a friend and am glad I bought it. It is very easy to put on, mistake proof and stays on very well. Would buy again. Does NOT dry lips :)",4
"I swim most days, so I wash my hair a lot and I have to be careful of products that dry out my hair.  This shampoo gets the saltwater out and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  I have light brown hair that is fairly straight and on the thick side.  Products that leave a lot of residue in my hair leave it flat and dull looking.  After using this shampoo my hair feels full and has body - always a good thing.  Since I like using a separate conditioner, I use this shampoo every other time I wash.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.

"Having been impressed with Remington's products in the past, I jumped at the chance to try out their new wet/dry hair straightener. After valiantly struggling with the plastic packaging for an embarrassing amount of time, I emerged victorious, if exhausted and disheveled, by the process. My impressions about the iron are mixed and will be detailed in the convenient pro/con list below.PROS- Can be used on both wet and dry hair (duh). Great idea that actually works (slightly).- Works better straightening dry hair than wet or damp hair, which when used wet left my thick and unruly hair slightly frizzy.- Auto shut-off after one hour. Great for the forgetful.CONS- Only one temperature (375F), so no adjusting that, only the wet/dry switch. And let me tell you, that is HOT! I usually crank up my other iron for maximum straightening power but it thankfully doesn't go this high. Even with my thick, wavy hair, I don't need it so hot.- The straightener doesn't glide well down my hair, it sorta snags or catches, though not so bad it pulls my hair out.- It's a bit bulkier than I'm used to, so it's more awkward to handle, especially while evading the steam vents. This may or may not be a problem for others.- The switches are super hard to move and I'm always afraid of slipping and burning my hand when turning it off. A button would have been a better idea.While I'll use my other straightener as my main one, I still will break this out any time I may need to straighten my hair fast after having washed it. The iron works fine but it wouldn't be my first, or even second, choice when choosing a new straightener.",3
"This is a nice, lightweight, product that shows proven results.  Pricey but worth it.  Doesn't weigh your eye down. Covers easily with make-up.",5
I didn't give it 5 stars because it has a tad bit of a greasy feel to it...making it take longer to &#34;dry&#34; on my face before I can put my makeup on.  I feel this moisturizer protects my face from my foundation sitting in my pores....I have had less breakouts.  I do recommend.,4
"I really like  the Rose face wash. It smells great,  applies easily like any liquid soap product, and lathers up well. It does a great job cleaning your face, gently. After use my face felt more alive, fresh and clean. I could actually see the difference, that was nice. I liked this product very much.I used The Rose Face Wash, Glycolic Peel, and Moisturizer together from this company. I have to say these products work well. My face feels refreshed and soft after use. I have sensitive skin and allergies so I must take extra cautions when using a product, but I had no problems with these products and no allergies. I recommend this regiment, and these products. You like what you see in the mirror.  I received free samples of these products for a fair and honest review",5
"I've used other brands of this type of product and I was disappointed that Neutrogena, which is probably my go to product for facial cleansers, didn't deliver like Stridex or Oxy pads. It left my face very sticky, so much I had the need to rinse it off after applying.",2
"ok, i actually don't know if it works yet, we haven't had a really sunny day here yet.  I got this after doing a lot of research to replace my DeVita solar50, which they changed the recipe.  It had been my favorite sunscreen then it turned my face white with big flecks.  This smells interesting and i will have to see if i burn or not later in summer.",4
"I had read a lot about this new product a while back but was a bit skeptical. Ordered it for the Summer since my hair is a frizz ball. It really, really works! My hair really felt silky and straight after I used it. Thrilled.",5
"The aroma of this product is lovely.  I have a Jacuzzi tub and adding this to my water is heavenly.  However, no matter what temperature water I use, I can not get the crystals to completely melt.  Perhaps they are not supposed to?  This could be because I use a water softener  with my well water.I did relax a lot while using this and my skin felt wonderful when I got out of the tub.  The aroma of lavender, bitter orange and other 'green' scents is a unique one.",3
Love this product.  I have extremely hard water and highlighted hair....not a good combo but the shampoo not only nourishes my hair but also takes the hard water by products out. Would def buy again,5
"This is a milky lavender pink color. My hands are dark, so this looks a little weird on me. I have better nudes like opi's its sheer luck and other light pinks which compliment me better. I don't have anything like this in my collection, so I will keep it. Maybe on beachy days it will be fun, but not for the office.",3
"The Conair Power Facial Cleanser is a nice little gadget that will easily and thoroughly cleanse your face, ridding it of dulling dead skin cells and letting your fresh new skin shine through.  Especially in winter, when we all have some leftover tan, the air is drying, and the time inside results in dry dull skin, exfoliating can give your face the appearance of new life.  It will not make you look 20, or take away your wrinkles, cure your acne, or be the first step to world peace.  It will, however, get your face cleaner than soap, water, and your fingertips will.  While I think it should be reserved for two to three times a week, it is not harsh enough to do damage should you decide to use it daily.Out of the box:  the cleanser, the cleansing brush, the moisturizer sponge, and 2 batteries.  Use your own skin care products and you are good to go!  It has 2 speeds, but I found the low speed to be relatively useless.  The brush is soft enough it would be difficult to overdo it.Overall, a nice little budget facial cleanser.",4
"A friend of mine wears this scent and I know that some perfumes don't always smell the same when they are on your own body, but I took a risk and I bought it and it paid off!!  I love this perfume!  I get a lot of compliments on it!",5
I was worried about the product coming intact. Sure enough one of the containers came opened. You can tell it was from shipment. Even though I lost one of the product it still was cheaper buying this way. I would probably order it again. Try it one more time. It was not an expired product. And did the job beautifully.,4
"Over the years we have all seen the commercials.  I decided to try.  I like this product very much.  I used for three weeks, and decided to go back to my old shampoo and conditioner.  Mistake.  What a difference!1.  Hair is very soft and manageable with Wen.2.  Hair feels healthier with Wen.3.  Hair feels thicker with Wen.I do use my own styling products, as I did not like the Wen mousse.  The mousse did nothing.  But, a friend of mine has used the other styling products, sprays, and liked them very much.**Note: friend of mine used the lavendar vanilla on her son's VERY corse hair.  His hair has never been softer, she states.",5
"First time using the liquid sand polishes. They are very pretty. Took some getting used to for the texture, but after a day or so I was used to it. And if you are prone to chipping, you can't really tell it unless it is a big chip. Liked them alot, I will be buying more of the liquid sand polishes I'm sure.",4
"This shampoo could not be more natural, clean and easy to use. I have pretty thin and short hair, the rest of the family ranges from so thick I could cry to long silky and fine. We all use this shampoo and it works beautifully. My daughter is a manic panic user, so keeping that in her hair is a nightmare. But when we use NaturOli Soap Nuts shampoo it stays longer. That is a huge plus. My hair, though thin and fine due to cancer feels fluffier and appears fuller. It does not grow hair nor does it say it does. But my hair is nicer, more like it was back in the day. I appreciate that. We are next going for the Soap Nuts liquid laundry detergent. Tiny bottle and huge number of loads, am hoping for excellent and clean results on that product too. If you are on the fence due to price, don't be. It's worth it.",5
"This was runny, and smelled funky. It did not do anything for my hair. I was new to B&B, and this was recommended to me. I tried it and used it twice, I just couldn't get used to it. The smell, the texture, the way my hair felt and smelled after. Hmmm, not a good decision on my part.",1
"this remover is SO awesome!! I have used gel polishes for two years now and always used the orangewood sticks.  Once I discovered this tool and began using it, I will never use an orangewood stick again!!",5
I got these in the nick of time as I was going out of town for the weekend. Suffice it to say this worked as designed. I didn't use a lot of it but what I did use prevented me from getting burned. Even in the water I was protected even though there's a higher risk there but in the end I can say that I recommend this very much. Perfect for the beach or just being out in the sun. One of the best I've used so far.,4
Bought this for my fianc&eacute;e. He likes it very much. He likes the soft bristles. Build quality is very good.,5
"First, Bellitae sent a follow-up email to check on how I was enjoying their product and the correct way to use it. What I did not know was that this is not meant to be the only serum for your face, you should follow-up the Vit C serum with your regular moisturizer. Good info to know. I was happy to have the follow-up email. Second, and most importantly, I have been using the serum for a week now. yesterday I spent 9 hrs in the sun doing volunteer work. My face was fairly red even though I tan easily & used a sun block. I applied the Belitae Vit C serum after my shower followed by my usual moisturizer and NO sign of any redness this morning.  I am very impressed.",5
"Sorry, but this just did not work for me. I wasted $25.00 for ZIP!If I have to go on a diet with just 500 to 800 calories a day, this supplement just isn't worth the money.If a person is going to eat 500-800 calories a day, they may as well just take some less expensive over-the-counter vitamins (as supplements)  which will probably help to supplement the individual more completely than &#34;1234&#34;.This product DID NOT curb my appetite...It basically did nothing.I have no side-effects from &#34;1234&#34;, but also, no results.",2
"Lovely long-lasting color, it may take a time or two to get application down.  It's a matte finish so I recommend waiting about 10 minutes after applying and adding a balm or gloss on top.",5
"These brushes are another great product from Shany.  I love to have an abundance of brushes, so when I can find a set of brushes with quality such as these for such an amazing price, I snatch them up!  Great buy!",4
"I must have received a &#34;spoiled&#34; product because the glue isn't glue at all, but goo! At first it was liquidy, then I shook it a ton and then nothing but gobs of goop came out - none of which helped my lashes to stick. I've used this glue before, so was disappointed when I tried using it again and it was a major fail.",1
"If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with. I like this for a pre-oil treatment before I wash my hair.",4
Hands down my favorite. Almost time to get another one already. I use all kinds of additives with this one and by itself.,5
"I'm not sure what they were thinking with this product - it goes on like a sticky gel and dries to a clear film that peels. Also not that soothing. You definitely can't use this under makeup, and at night my skin sticks to the pillow. Yuck. Two stars because it didn't irritate.",2
"I was really surprised at the texture - it is like a mud mask texture and very nice! I have oily skin. I don't suffer from many breakouts but I do always have a shine to my face. This product is great for oily skin. My skin is also sensitive and this did not bother it. This felt like a spa treatment. I can tell that it works really well so it may not be a good idea to use every single day but every other day perhaps. Some of the reviewers said it dried their skin... just don't use it excessively and yes it's made for oily skin. So if you don't have oily skin, don't use it. It was thick and smooth and didn't have a smell. I really liked how it felt and will continue to use this product. I love the 100% pure brand products and all my cosmetics are from them.",5
"Eh. Haven't been seeing much spot (only one) reduction, but like the texture and will continue to use. Pleasant on skin.",4
"As someone with Roseacea -a sensitive skin condition characterized by red, inflamed skin on nose, cheeks and chin, but dry, flaky skin everywhere else-I was interested to see if this product could help the flakiness while NOT inflaming the redness.After trying for a week, using the 4 times that week as suggested on the product-I DID see a noticeable improvement with my dryness and flakiness, and it didn't aggravate the reddened area either.  The price-at around $3.50 a bottle is very reasonable-though I don't see where the average consumer would want 12 bottles at once-perhaps several people can share an order?The smell is light and inoffensive-nondescript enough for even use on a man or teenage boy. I did like that the granules were tiny, as I've tried others with larger bits that has hurt:( While it did seem a little difficult to wash off, I'll admit I was using a wet cloth as I'm not a ""splash water in my face"" kinda chick-and that method may yield better results..So all in all, this sensitive skin reviewer would recommend this product.4 stars.",4
This product did not help with underarm odor or sweat. I don't really like the smell. Will not buy again.,2
When used with the shampoo it leaves my hair manageable and easy to style. This is a great combo to change to for variety.,4
I bought this to help take off the gel nails I do. This works way better than the little wooden stick I got that came with a gel manicure set. The stainless steel is very durable and heavy and helps take off the gel nail polish quickly.,5
"I have used the eye make-up remover pads several times and am pleased with the results. At first they didn't seem moist enough to do the job, but it takes just a few swipes to completely remove all make-up. They are soft and gentle, fragrance free, oil free and leave no residue whatsoever. Appropriately named, this is a simple but very effective product.",5
I absolutely am in love with this blush! It took a few tries to figure out the easiest way to apply it but once I figured it out it was love at first sight! It's a simple pink that can build able to a much darker shade. Plus it stays on all day!,5
"Okay here is the deal: When my hair is freshly dyed dark brown, and especially when it has any hint of warm/red tones in it, this looks great in my eyebrows. If your hair is any less vivid (lighter, cooler tones, or just more dull) then this might look like too much. You can try and apply it super-sparingly but it is very difficult to achieve because it is a very color infused gel. And it dries really quickly. So when I am feeling like I really have time to get ready in the mornings then this looks good if I can use a really light touch with a fine tip brush and then comb it through before it dries. If I am in a hurry getting ready, this is just not practical because it is too easy to wind up looking like a clown if you don't really take your time.",4
"I have tried the Olay Pro-X and loved it for years; it saved my Mary-Kay-ruined skin. Then I tried the Anew Wrinkle Corrector and no matter what else I try to stray away to, I always come back to the Avon Anew products.I have tried just about everything (except that $200 La Mer LOL) and nothing is any better than the Anew. It especially makes my neck skin look soft, smooth and hydrated. I use retinoids and Finacea so my skin can get pretty dried out and flaky, but if I use the Anew or their new Genics, my face is smooth and not flaky when I wake up in the morning. It feels nice and hydrated, it doesn't get that crepey look any more. (I'm probably a LOT older than the folks who reviewed this and it didn't 'do' anything for them...because they have young skin already)I've pretty much given up on ever finding anything I like better than the Anew line, I try every new high-end product as it is launched and still I go back to Anew. I'm not even an Avon fan but when you find something that works, you stick by it until you find something better! I don't foresee anything better right now. (I just tried and returned Lancome's new Genifique, a direct competitor of the Genics from Avon....sorry Lancome, I gave you a whole month to dazzle me...Ditto for Estee Lauder serum....)",5
This didn't last me anytime..seemed like there wasn't much in it. Couldn't tell the difference in my eye area. Just okay,3
"I have had this product for sometime, but I have not been using it as frequently as I should but so far I have had no problems. My daughter has even used it to help with breakouts. All I can say is so far so good. For me it is cheaper and nicer to use this machine in the privacy of my home rather then going somewhere.",4
"This mask delivers everything it promises. I have tried far too many clay masks in the past and have always been disappointed. It's been about a year since I've even bothered with a mask, until now! I tried this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Adovia and it's just amazing! It dried up oil, it shrinks and clears out my pores, it has really dried up my acne, and seems to have also helped fill in my fine lines. Love it! Highly recommend!",5
"I bought this with excitement! Wrong answer!!! It was hard I could barely use my finger to apply it, it wouldn't blend it was so oily! And it showed every line under my eyes! Its went to the trash right away!",1
"This is a great shine spray. While I usually use TGI products, I found that this one offers more shine for a lot less money. Excellent product.",5
I've used this moisturizer for a couple of years.  Great daytime moisturizing product.  Not at all greasy.  Easily absorbed and does a great job.  With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better!,5
"AMAZING NAIL WHEELS! Bought to show me my polishes easily. These are super durable and hold up very very well! Acetone doesn't bother it at all either, which is so convenient because I'm always wishing to play around with nails like these.",5
"I like that this foam doesn't have parabens or dyes. The scent is nice and it did give my hair extra body. I felt it was a little bit of a sticky/stiff hold, not as natural as some other products I've used, but it's possible that I just used too much. Overall it's a very nice styling aid.",4
This isn't heavy feeling and I like the roller applicator for even distribution. It doesn't feel heavy on my skin and stay where I put it. I don't need to use powder with this as my face doesn't shine.,5
"My hair is fuller and looks great.  Works as is stated,  Not falling out like it was and has repaired the problems I was having",5
The lip butters combine the best of lipstick and the best of lip balm. This color is a little too orange for me but would be dynamite on anyone with any hint of yellow undertones.,4
"Its hard to get volume with my hair, its super thin and super straight. BUT Toni&Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip really actually worked! a dollop worked through my roots then blow dried, gave me lift and volume with movement without making my hair look poofy or stiff.",4
"Very cheap and very nice facial moisturizer! I am planning to buy another for my mother, and I think she will also like it both because its price and its effect!",5
"Wish I had discovered this sooner. Great quality. Works well for chapped lips or to soften or prevent cracking of the feet, or around the eyes to soften wrinkles.",5
"i love using this palette! the concealers are creamy, and have great coverage and lasting power. i recommend this to all of my friends, and recommend it to you as well!",5
"i have been ordering meaningfull beauty for about a year now and its awsome,its the best product iv ever used in my life..i would recommend this to every women in the world",5
"I have tried so many costly serums, cremes and the list goes on to get rid of my dry, dull looking mature skin.Finally this is the productMy daughter uses the Garnier day lotion with SPF , love the smell on it and the texture and use it on occassions , then I saw this for this amazing price on Amazon and ordered it.Anyway you apply this, is it an amazing product.I can use it under my make up, and it eliminates the PRIMER (I use cinema secrets foundation highly recommend it, for mature, dry skin , acne adult prone skin , anyone who needs buildable coverage or just a little make up, it is so versitile, but being a creme foundation it needs a good moisturizing base) and the garnier moisture resuce gel is amazing!It feels nice fresh, and being a gel it is NOT sticky at all. A little goes such a long way !After using it as base of my make up ( at times I use a bit of hyaluronic acid, awesome product !under it) , and when finished ( if you want to try the cinema secrets foundation, or actually any other foundation, even liquid, give it a try and us a 1 dollar elf brush(Target) and lightly buff the foundation in.I am not sure how it works but the garnier gel cream brings out the best in my make up.I do have acne scars and yet with the combination of these products and able to apply the products for a natural look yet very nice flawless coverage !To freshen up , put a little of the gel cream in a little tiny pot you can carry in your purse and refresh your look - I only use a couple dabs, use very little at first to see how it works with your foundation, especially if you are using a liquid one, and it will just give you a nice fresh look.You know the kind you see on some ladies in their 60th or older that seem to still have a nice fresh look on their cheeks, I think I found out their secret:) Garnier Moisture rescue Gel CreamHighly recommend this product especially for under $ 7!!!I finally found my HG in a primer, moisturizer!",5
"Gave it to a girlfriend who wears shorter hair.  She found it to be a light to medium weight holding gel with a mild fragrance; however, she also quickly realized that short hair is its limit -- anything past a few inches and it probably won't hold as well.Of note, she said it did last quite a few hours in low humidity but once our Florida humidity kicked in it lost some of its hold.",4
"I bought this particular brand of metallic polish on the recommendation it was good for stamping. I have used all but two colors so far, with very good results. (Only one that did not work was the white.) Considering the cost of stamping polishes, this set was a steal! Nice color variety too.",5
"I use this product to deep clean my face; however, it is an excellent to exfoliate any part of your body--legs, feet, hands, etc. It's gentle enough for the face, yet excellent enough to use anywhere effectively.",5
"Just decided to share my viewpoint.  I think he brushes are just fine; however, I need to learn how to use them.  I'm not qualified to say they're good or bad, so I'll rate good.",5
"Have tried both the Sensitive and the Hydrate face washes. They both work great. Feels good going on and does a nice job of cleaning up my mug without drying it out. I tend to like a hard deep clean scrub on my face so I typically use a wash with some form of grit.  However, I don't want that everyday so this is a nice product to switch to for a more gentle cleanse.  I prefer the Hydrate over the Sensitive which although is supposed to be ""scent neutral"" actually has a bit of an odd smell. The Hydrate has a nice mild mature scent that is not at all overpowering. My only gripe is that they are a little pricey for the amount you get. Otherwise, good stuff.",4
"I've bought a lot of inexpensive straighteners and they have never worked as well as the HSI. After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase one and see the results for myself. It worked greatly on my hair and I am very satisfied with it as it does not burn or dry out my hair. My friends have bought straighteners over $100 and they still complain about its functions, so for those who are looking to buy a new one, why not try the HSI and see how wonderfully it works!",5
You have to use a lot of it and its pricey. It does condition better than most comparable products because its a deep conditioner but still leaves hair tangled. I do like their detangler though.,4
"Picked this up for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, its always been my favorite Cologne and still is, I have yet to find a man it doesn't smell amazing on. I think the price on Amazon is a really good deal for the quantity on such a quality Cologne, definitely a great deal. Highly recommended!",5
"I got fed up paying five dollars retail for a small pack of round pads so I tried Amazon, bought these 'in bulk' figuring in the long run I'd save money. I love them! They are large, like a small washcloth but that really works for me. I fold them in half and use one half for makeup removal and the other for toner and then I use the other side too. If you are used to the small round ones these might take a day or two to adapt to, but I wouldn't go back to the smaller ones after seeing how versatile these are, and to me they are super economical because I get a few days use out of just one.",5
"I've been looking for eco-friendly prodcuts without the price.  These bags worked however, they were thin and I had several of the bags tear at the top on me when I tied them. The material isn't horrible but it's like buying the off brand kitchen bags instead of the Glad bags.  So they work but they definetly tear easy.  If you are looking for an eco-friendly alternative but don't expect the Glad heavy duty style, then these are for you.  They didn't bother me but my husband frankily wasn't fond of paying for bags that ended up tearing or the drawstrings breaking.  The price was definetly on target from what I wanted to pay for eco-friendly but they are not much cheaper than the Glad force field and they tear so it's hard saying.  I think it comes down to being eco-friendly or buying a heavier duty bag.",4
"This is a beautiful periwinkle blue, but streaky beyond belief.  I wear polish all the time and can apply my own polish with very professional results.  This took three coats and streaked even on the third coat.  It evened out with some Seche Vite on top of it, but it's still not perfect if I look closely in sunlight.  No worth all my hard work.  I'll take it off in a couple of days.  It's going in the trash.",1
"I'm a big fan of this shampoo.  More so than the conditioner.  I only use sulfate-free shampoos and this one is one of my favourites.  Leaves my hair feeling clean, and a little goes a long way.  I always pick it up on Amazon as it's the cheapest here.  This is one shampoo that will always be in the rotation.  Smells great, too, kind of like marzipan.",5
this item arrived leaking all over the paper packaging.  I could not use it.  It was messy and disgusting.  I was sad because I would have like to try it but the bottle being broken I could not.,1
"I've wanted to try this brow setting gel because I've heard so much about it, but I didn't want to pay the high price. I was really happy to find a travel/trial size. This stuff is great! I deff will purchase the travel size again! Sets brows all day long. And they don't feel stiff.",5
"There is a great assortment of colors, only one set of doubles. I'm a very picky person when it comes to my nails and about the only thing that bothered me was that there were quite a few glitter polishes, in lots of colors and fun shapes and sizes, but glitter none-the-less. At first, i was upset because I was looking for more solid colors. Then i realized that out of all of my polishes (including this purchase, i have well over 100) I didn't have ANY glitter ones....It was at that point that i realized how fortunate i was. Nail polish is pretty expensive, and i never thought to purchase glitter ones, but now that I have them, i absolutely love them!!! There are about 8 glitter polishes in total...and the rest are solids, but beautiful hues that you just don't see everywhere! At approximately a dollar a bottle, it is definitely worth the purchase!",5
I use this brush fairly often and it has held up extremely well.  Great value and supreme quality.  Very smooth on the face.,5
I really like the way this product smells and the idea of what it is supposed to do with the benefits of Argan oil but would not use as a mousse. I think of mousse as something to give your hair a little lift at the roots but this product did not deliver for me.,3
"The product is too expensive for the average person to afford to use and I felt it was wasteful due to the amount that the directions said to use. Twenty (20) pumps for hair only down to my ear lobes! My scalp began itching and it was inconvenient to have to spend so much time working in the product and giving it time to work. I did get more shine, but no more volume or body. I think the claims they make are mostly hype. I am tired of products that don't work like they say they will. I need to see real results. I won't be using  this product any more.",2
perfect perfect perfect for nails takes a while to come in but for the price its worth the wait great product,5
These eyelashes look great if you want to look glamorous at night or for photographs. They are VERY thick so if you are looking for eyelashes to wear during the day I would suggest getting the regular not the thick. I like to cut them in half for a less dramatic look and apply the half half way across the lid (middle to outer edge) or in fourths and apply a fourth just at the outer ends of my eyes after i apply eyeliner. They are reuseable and come in a ten pack. Very good deal price wise. I'm glad I found this seller on amazon and I will purchase products form them in the future.,5
"I blow dry & straighten my hair almost every day, so I really need something to protect it from the extreme heat! This spray does the trick. The spray nozzle sprays out a fine mist that lightly coats my hair without weighing it down. It makes my hair feel and smell great! I've tried several other brands but they were greasy, smelled bad, or were really expensive. This leaves my hair soft and silky and for an affordable price!",5
"I'm 38 years old and after having two children in the last 5 years, my once thick and shiny hair is much thinner and has lost a lot of it's shine and luster. Childbirth combined with age have left my hair flat, slightly frizzy and dull. The first two times I tried this spray I didn't see any difference, but the third time I used it I was super impressed with how much thicker my hair looked and felt and my normally flat hair had some texture. My hair hasn't looked this thick and full since I was in my 20's. Also, when the spray is applied to the scalp there is a cooling sensation that I find very pleasing. After using this spray for about a month, I'm so pleased with the results and the only downside is that it dulls what little shine my hair has left. If you want noticeably thicker hair and are less concerned with shine, then this product is truly great.",4
I'm an older female and have thought to up my makeup game by purchasing this brow powder. I found out I do just as good a job as I have for years without using this new fangled item.,3
"THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ^^^ Mine was more of a bronze and silver tube and it was ""Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer"". It has SPF 30 with soy ingredients ""to help blotchiness and the appearance of dark spots"".  I opened my package and was like wtf. I decided to try it because its the middle of summer and I have no SPF products. It was very moisturizing and it smelled nice. I use it everyday after washing my face or getting out of the pool. I'm just glad that I like the product that isn't being shown. Hoped this helped.",5
"I have thick long hair almost waist length, and this dryer is able to dry my whole head in 10 minutes. Talk about time saving convience.This wonderful dryer takes less than half the time my old dryer took. Now I can dry my hair in less than 10 minutes.I love this dryer. Does cost a little more but well worth it.You will love this dryer and will make great Christmas Present for any one ages 6 and up.",5
"I like this product but it's hard to work with. I read the reviews before I ordered and used this product so I was prepared. I think mousses are just harder to work with than lotions are. Definitely use gloves and make sure your skin is moisturized before applying, That can be probematic though, you don't want to use a lotion that's going to interfere with the tanning process of this product. Good luck!",4
"One thing I like about this bonnet/cap is that it stays on. If you're a rough sleeper like me, that's a really big deal. Also, the outside is indeed satin, which is great for hair. Unfortunately the ""soft inside"" is not satin. I have fairly short, curly, type 3c and 4a African American hair. On multiple occasions, I noticed that I could feel my hair snagging on the inside of this cap when I took it off in the morning. I'd look inside the cap and see that strands had been ripped out during the night. Quite disheartening! Also, the black dye on the cap left ugly stains on my pillow cases and sheets.One more thing...I decided to turn the cap inside-out & I had much better results.  Since the outside of the cap is true satin, it doesn't snag my hair at all. Also, the elastic doesn't eat away at my edges when wearing it like this.",2
"If they ever discontinue this product I will CRY. Okay, that's a little melodramatic. I will tear up a little, though :) But seriously - this product is *amazing*!!  I discovered it a year or two ago and even did the subscribe and save (until I realized I was having it shipped more frequently than I was actually using it. Now I have a mini-stockpile so I'm set if it's ever discontinued. If you like being orange this is not the product for you. This product goes on easily and looks FANTASTIC. Totally natural. Just don't go spraying it on every day (as I did once for 4 or 5 days in a row) - b/c then you will look orange. Stick to every other day or every few days and you'll look like you live in CA year-round.",5
"This soap really works if you use it everyday, you can start seeing result in about two or three week.",5
The pencil liner broke it on the very first use..and liquid liner is not really smooth...I use it to apply a small dot in my face :P just as a bhindi..since we Indians keep it often,1
"This is an ok liner, but it doesn't stay on the way the Cover Girl liquid liner does.  The Cover Girl liner does not budge.  This one smears as much as a regular eye pencil.The other problem is that the color is COMPLETELY different than the description and picture.  I ordered ""midnight,"" which is suppose to be a dark blue.  The picture illustrates a color that is a bit lighter than navy.  It is almost completely black.  I'm extremely fair, and cannot wear anything this dark.  Complete waste of money.",2
great eye moisturizer for sensitive skin. fragrance free. best use in night time since it's a little oily under makeup.,5
"This didn't stamp very well, I'm disappointed. The design comes out messy and I tried using different kinds of nail polish too....still stinks. It's sitting on my table collecting dust...",1
"Forget the low price, this is the one for you. Forget the negative comments. I have had not one problem with mine. I don't think you'll regret this item at all. It does come from China and takes a while to get to you but it will be well worth it for the price. I have no regrets at all. A really good deal!,",5
"This review is for the Dove Men + Care Hydrate Shave Gel.This gel has a mild, nice scent.  From the overall positive reviews, I was hopeful that I'd get a better shaving experience than I'm currently getting using Gilette Shave Gel, but I don't think I can say that because the pros and cons for the two products just about even out for me.I still feel a little bit of sting during and after shaving, although the sting seems to linger longer after a Gilette shave than a Dove shave.  The Dove gel seems thinner and runnier than the Gilette gel and I often have to use just a bit more of it per shave than when I'm using the Gilette gel.",3
I expected better. This stuff smells so cheap. A few whiffs make you feel like you've been smothered with gardenias. Reminds me of the uber-cheap Gloria Vanderbilt perfume sets from the 80s. An ex gave me a set for Christmas one year (because it was under $20 for the whole set) and it was SO sweet it almost put me into insulin shock. I'm sorry I thought Madonna would TRY something seductive. This is an epic fail.,1
"Believe the description that says this is lightweight.  My hair is on the fine side but is also curly and tends to frizz in the wet climate where I live.  If I put this on my hair post-shower, it does a nice job of softening, but if I apply it to dry hair that's getting unruly, it does a fantastic job of smoothing my hair back down without making it gunky or weighted-down.",5
These brushes r simply heavenly I am very pleased with this product I cant think of anything to complain about!  Thumbs up to the price and the seller!,5
"This is my favorite brow pencil ever, the color is perfect I have dark brown hair and I don't like harsh brows this color fits perfectly and it lasts all day (with elf's eyebrow gel over it) and this product makes it easy to create the perfect eyebrow shape. The only thing is there is not a lot of product in it, this pencil will last me 2 weeks (2 1/2 max) so I have to constantly purchase them or stock up but they're worth it.",5
I use this in my hair before other styling products and it helps to protect and moisturize. I use it on my skin before hot yoga and it helps keep my skin nourished without getting greasy. I love it!,5
"Overall, I like the size, style, etc of the HSI 1"" flat iron BUT there is NO WAY it got to 400+ degrees! I really liked the moveable plates and really wish it had gotten hotter. I have full, straight hair and use a flat iron daily to flatten and compact and de-wrinkle my hair. The HSI didn't do much to my hair but when my CROC died I thought I would try this one out. No go. I cannot believe the number of good ratings though! Perhaps I got a dud?",1
"I had never heard of this product before I came across some reviews of top beauty products on makeupalley.com. Folks raved about the power of this little tool. At $47 I was hesitant but decided to ante up. And I am so glad I did.The #11 buffer is an outstanding tool. Used dry, you simple rub it across your feet. Dry skin quickly sheds off leaving a soft smooth surface. I follow the buffing with a good moisturizer and tuck my tootsies in socks. The results are smooth, soft pampered feet!The price may seem high at first, but a pittance when you think of all the money you would have spent on pedicures.The tool is designed to last for years and after use a quick wash with a small soft toothbrush and soap will have it ready for the next use.An excellent value!",5
"These use to be better quality. I have short hair just long enough to throw in a ponytail. These work terrific and staying on and not slipping in my short, fine hair. My biggest complaint is they break after 1 use, on average. I may get a couple of pony tails out of one, but not very often. So, if you need something that holds well, these are great, just make sure you carry spares on you. If not, you will be left in a mess as I was when I went to straighten my hair up and it busted on me. Luckily I had a couple of bobby pins in holding some layers back, so I was able to makeshift a teeny bun. Now I keep extras in my purse.",2
"The first razor out of the package felt as though it was dull from the very first swipe. These are intended to trim the lady bits -- the package comes with three razors and a separate trimmer attachment -- but I used it on my legs first, because nothing goes near the bits until I test it out first. I'm glad I did, because the conditioning strip did nothing, just felt like a piece of dry cardboard, and the razors were dull. It was irritating and uncomfortable right out of the package.That said, the second and third razors were better, so I'm thinking there's a quality control issue here. It only lasted one shave on the legs, though, when most razors last two, sometimes three on the higher-quality disposables.Then came time to try the trimmer attachment. It's a kind of comb with a razor underneath meant to trim (let's be honest) the bush. It looks very similar in shape to the attachment on the electric razor I usually use. One swipe of this Bic attachment and it was clogged. Cleaned it off, did a second swipe, and it was dull enough I didn't want to use it anymore, so I used a third swipe to &#34;even things out&#34; and moved on with my life. I'd say that this said more about the hair on my bod than the razors, but other brands have worked just fine, and I see other reviewers had similar issues, so I'm thinking the razor is the issue in this particular situation. I really cannot recommend these razors at all.",1
"Maybe I'm just not coordinated, but I can't get it to work. Could be me, could be the product. You be the judge",2
"I was very much looking forward to using this color but was disappointed when I actually did. It is very thick and sticky, even when i shake it in between each application. Maybe i got a bottle from a bad batch...",3
"Nivea's creamy formula was/is a nicely concentrated wash that smells good, not overpowering and isn't something that'd trigger an allergy attack. Good stuff, feels sorta silky and makes the cut for my shower!",5
"Excellent for clearing up post inflammatory hyper pigmentation. I'm fair skinned (very very pale), so I scar easily. With trouble combination skin, acne, age, etc...this has been a problem I've dealt with for years, nearly decades. The problem with cystic acne is you can develop post inflammatory hyper pigmentation, which in simple terms are those dark splotchy purple/red spots that linger for months as it heals, sometimes even permanently scarring the area. And if you are older than your usual acne sufferer (ie a teenager), it takes even longer for them to go away because of the time it takes for collagen & elastin to be produced in the body. They are unsightly & seem to take forever to go away, especially if you get multiple flare ups of acne atop the same spot. Well, I finally managed to get the acne under control & decided I needed to get a product that could help clear up the dark marks left over on my cheeks. I've seen dermatologists multiple times for both acne & scarring, & although they are very capable, at times their remedies are costly. I needed something affordable and effective. I happened across this product amidst researched reviews & reports. It was priced affordably and seemed to have majority positive reviews on various sites. I did buy this elsewhere in a single tube to try it first, before investing in a multi-pack. There are two kinds: normal & oily skin. I got the one for normal, though perhaps I should have considered for oily, as it will moisturize the sites in which you apply it. But I've not broken out because of it thus far. I've used it for about a week now, apply twice a day as it recommends. I wash my face, treat it for acne, apply this (ONLY to the sites of discoloration), & top it off with sunblock. I wear sunblock anyway, but it is HIGHLY recommended that you wear it, especially when using this product. It works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin, within the site of application. Not using sunscreen/block, allows the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin's melanin is what makes us tan & freckle; protecting & reacting to the sun's rays. Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while. It does have it's own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) & wear sunscreen everyday. & don't trust the ones only in your make up. It degrades over time & tends to be a low spf. I digress, in the short amount of time, Ambi has managed not to break me out further & the areas of extreme discoloration have already improved by 50%. I'm extremely please with the results. The majority of dark purple contrast has faded to a light pink or pale red. This type of result would have taken me weeks without assistance. Ambi recommends you use it for about 3 months & discontinue use thereafter. I would theorize that my spots will diminish adequately long before then. Remember, there is no magic cure or youth potion, but if you take care of your skin when you are in your teens & early 20's (avoiding excessive sun, wearing sunscreen, handling acne, etc...) you'll be much better off in the long run. And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.",5
"I waited almost a  month for these and they never arrived.  However, once I contacted the seller, after some discussion, she resent the item...another long wait.Still, I did receive the item and I appreciate the sellers integrity, but it was a lot of work for $5!  :)The files are good quality, and I can recommend them at this price, with an honest seller.",4
"These strips are simple to use and they really work. They get my pores really clean, it doesn't dry out my face and they work really fast. It takes about 5 - 10min. for the strip to dry. I also like the glow of my skins complexion after using the strips. For $9 it's a great price. 14 strips total for the face and nose.",5
"Obviously the best eyelashes ever. They last very long if you take proper care of them. They look natural with just a hint of drama. Very girly eyelashes, this is my second time ordering in bulk of these lashes.",5
"I can't tell if this is a fake or not, as I haven't smelled it at the store. I can say it doesn't smell like peaches and cream to me, or any of the notes listed on some of the perfume web sites. It smells kinda cheap and has that phony burnt-popcorn aroma that a lot of cheap perfumes have. It also had no staying power (not that I'd want it to..) for an EDP. I dunno. The box was lovely, bottle was clearly real, and no signs of tampering. Could be real. I don't like it, though :(",2
"I have been a huge fan of the Big Sexy Powder Play product for years. I decided to give this product a try, because it's supposed to be similar, but it was a little bit cheaper. I didn't like it very much. The product was just too sticky and dry. I love the texture these types of products provide for my soft, slippery, fine hair, but this one was so sticky, I couldn't style it or run my fingers through it all. My hair felt kinda like a big clump. Haha. I'll be sticking with the Big Sexy brand from now on. That one provides lots of texture and control, but more ability to style once the product is in.",2
"Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn't have time to polish her nails 4 times a week! I use this for french manicures, and it would perfectly.  Very translucent, subtle pink.",4
"I've used this a few times and I love it! All self tans can get blotchy in dry areas and around fingers and heels, etc. this works great at blending the tanner in a little more. Fast shipping!",5
This is a nice plate. Lots of holiday designs as well as many for just anytime.  There are also quite a bit of reversed images on this plate which is nice.  All the images on this plate stamp crisp and clear.,5
"I just love Caress Body Washes, my 10yr old daughter and I pick a different one every few weeks and have yet to be disappointed. I see several people here complaining that the scent doesn't last on their skin... I suppose I might be in the minority with this but I don't want it to. I love the smells during my shower, they remind me of a spa or vacation... but once I'm out and dried off I have my usual lotions or perfume to wear and don't want to walk around smelling like whatever scent I opted to use in the shower.They lather well, my skin feels clean without being dried out and they are a good value for the size of the container. You do need to be careful when opening them though, I've had them splash up into my face and this one in particular burned my eye so badly when a tiny drop got in it that I had to end my shower and my eye hurt for hours after rinsing it out... so be mindful of that and don't use these on any young children who might get them in their eyes.",5
"I had bought these thinner exfoliating gloves at target and really liked them.  I wanted an extra pair but didn't like the colors available so I ended up getting a loofah.  Compared to my exfoliating gloves, the loofah just didn't work as well and I've read that the gloves are just more hygienic than the loofah because they dry easily. So, I came on Amazon and searched for the gloves in a different color.I liked this color and that they came in a 4 pack.  They are so much nicer than the ones I'd gotten at target.  For one, they feel thicker, sturdier which is nice.  They also feel somehow less scratchy but still leave my skin smooth.I use them in my shower but they work best when I've soaked in my tub about 20 minutes.  After I've done that, I start scrubbing my body down and its amazing how much dead skin comes off.  Maybe its because I sometimes only do it once a week, but I will rub my arm with the glove and look at it and I can see a white haze of skin on it. Its kind of gross but at least I know its working. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward.",5
I use this in my homemade soaps and it works great! I will definitely be purchasing again. NOW always has good quality stuff for good prices.,5
"I love many of Biore's products and my daily face wash is from their line. I enjoy trying their different products and was excited to try the Steam Activated Cleanser. It lather ups really nice and it did leave a clean feeling on my face. The little beads in it dissolve as soon as you lather it up in the shower. The scent used in this facial cleanser smells good too. It had a minty fresh clean scent to it. Once I placed it on my face, my face had a tingly sensation as well. Sadly, after using it for a few consecutive days, it dried my skin out really bad, even when using moisturizer. My skin is more dry in the colder months so I'll probably limit my use of it until the weather gets warmer.Overall, not a bad cleanser. My face felt refreshed and clean after using it. I just wish it wasn't so drying to my skin.",3
"Mrs. Meyers is the only dish soap I can use that doesn't dry my hands -- this winter is the first since I started doing dishes that I don't have cracked, bleeding hands! I have tried plenty of natural dish soaps, but only Mrs. Meyers is this ""skin-friendly"". The lovely, sweet scent is an added bonus (usually, I have to use unscented products).",5
"I have type 4 hair and I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be from reading some of the reviews. I do like the way it smells. For the price, I think I will try something else next time and not continue using this.Side note the product I received had no kind of seal on the tub of conditioner which was weird to me idk I just expected it not to look like it was previously opened...",3
"Well this stuff didn't live up to the hype. I was curious about it for years after seeing women swear by it in commercials, but it's just an average thick cream conditioner. It's no different than any one I've ever tried. I think straight-haired women are wowed by this stuff just because they didn't use conditioner before. I have 3c curls - so I have to use conditioner every time I wash otherwise I'd get a crow's nest in my hair. Wen is nothing special, nothing to write home about. Save your money.",3
"I purchased this product because it has natural ingredients, and the positive reviews caught my attention. I have fair, combination-sensitive skin and I hoped that this creme would brighten my complexion. Rather than giving me a smoother, more even complexion, the creme caused me to break out worse than I ever have. After just one use I developed big, painful pimples that lasted for weeks. Every product has different effects on different skin types, but I urge those with sensitive, acne-prone skin to be wary of the Radiance Day Creme.",1
I love the color I got with this ! I'm a hairstylist and my hair has been thru it all and coloring it red over and over I just stumbled across this one day and thought why not !? It smells green for at least 2 days after u do it. Other than that I love it ! &#128513; I bought more!,5
"This stuff is great. I don't like using hairspray or pretty much anything in my hair, really. I have a problem with fly aways and slight frizziness so this stuff is amazing. And it smells good too! I put a little on my hands and run it through my hair right when I get out of the shower. Also, I like to put some on before I straighten my hair. A little goes a long way, too.",5
"I know this might sound a little dramatic, but this stuff has transformed my hair. I first heard about it on youtube from a girl who was promoting it to use with long hair. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. I ended it up using it on myself too and I cannot say enough good things about this product. It smells amazing for starters. It also really and truly detangles, which is great because I am growing my hair out and do not want to break any of it. Since I've started using it every day, I have received several compliments on how soft, healthy and shiny my hair looks. I use it liberally and it never makes my hair look greasy or filmy like some other leave-ins do. I have a hairdresser who is very loyal to Moroccan Oil products. He always wants me to use them, but I don't totally like what it does in my hair. Last time I saw him, he said my hair looked great and to keep using whatever I was using because it was doing really good things. I am hooked on this stuff and I hope it's around forever!",5
"At first I really liked it, because the brush applicator lets me easily apply the product to the roots. Also, I don't mind the powdery effect because I prefer it to the stiff look of color sprays and wands. However, as the day progressed, I noticed that the powder started to settle down across my hairline. Would only use this when I have bangs which would cover the hairline.",2
"SpaSensials Hand And Foot Treatment System gives you two pairs of moisturizing gloves, two pairs of moisturizing socks and two exfoliating buffs all kept fresh in plastic packages. The gloves and socks are designed to make your skin become much less dry, cracked--and much more moisturized. The insides of the socks and gloves are coated with a thin layer of liquid vitamin A, B5, aloe, avocado and jojoba. The exfoliating buff is designed to work on your hands and feet but it could be used anywhere else on your body where you want to exfoliate your skin. Keep the gloves and everything else inside their plastic packages until you're ready to use them. Overall, the product helps your skin improve but I can't say it's perfect.The gloves go on easily; and they should be worn for fifteen minutes to get the full effect. The socks also need to be worn for fifteen minutes to get rid of that dry, cracked skin that so many of us get on our feet. Unfortunately, the socks didn't go on easily. Although the manufacturer claims the socks are ""one size fits most,"" even for my average sized feet I had to struggle somewhat just to get them on--and one of the socks tore slightly despite my best efforts to put it on correctly.The exfoliating buff works but not as well as I would have liked. Use the textured side to exfoliate; and use the smooth side for cleansing your skin.  Unfortunately, even after I discovered how to use it, the exfoliating buff still didn't do the job I hoped it would.Be careful to store this out of the reach of children and keep all items inside the packets until you're ready to use them.Have further questions about this product? The manufacturer, Kimberly-Clark, gives customers a toll free number so people can contact the company. Good PR!Overall, Kimberly-Clark wants to give people a rather trendy, ""hip and happening"" hand and foot moisturizing product; but they succeed only partway. The gloves did help; but the skin on my feet wasn't fully healed by the socks which were too small even for my average sized feet. I found the buff to be merely average.Nice try--but not as good as I would have liked.  Three stars.",3
Love Kleancolor polishes.  These are all gorgeous.,5
Used this product to dye my hair from a dark brown to a red. Seems to work well and I have left over as well.,4
"I'm a licensed esthetician and bought this product due to an excellent review from the beauty editor at the NY Times.  This product does absolutely nothing to exfoliate the skin.  The base in the product is far too viscous to do anything but glide around the face, and the very small amount of granular scrubbing ingredients cannot even reach the skin.  Skip this one.",1
Its never arrived to my house. I was very looking forward to it. This is an prime item so it should of been here within a couple days but its been over a week now.,1
"This product seems to work fairly well.  I am using my second bottle of the serum and it does seem to make my face feelsofter and smoother.  I am 65 years of age and my skin is not winkled a lot around my eyes or my mouth but, I was beginning to get the early jowls around my mouth. At this point I must say that they appear to have receded.  The serum smooths on easily and quickly so that morning and bedtime routine is completed in a very timely fashion.  I'm very happy with the outcome thus far.  This product will last about a month and only costs $23.00 which I thought was amazing for what it does.",4
"Really love this , used this after I caught the flu . Normally my eye lids are extremly moist , so when I caught the flu , they were really bad ! Used this and it really helped !! I use Loreal Infallible eye shadow with this and so far great , lasted long enough with my eyes watering real bad , oooh 4 hours or so . Not bad !! My only complaint , the picture is very decieving , as it looked to me that I was going to get 2 boxes instead of one  , that why I gave this only 4 stars . Might want to update the picture sometime .",4
"These wraps do work well for removing gel polish.  But to be honest, they are not the easiest to use on yourself.  I have started doing gel polish for myself.  I find that trying to apply these wraps with one hand is a bit awkward. Would work better in a salon setting with someone else applying.",4
"I absolutely love how this treatment mask make me hair feel right away. The effects are noticeable and not much is needed. The instructions on this says to use it in place of conditioner two times a week. After using the treatment mask, I notice my hair is a lot more managable and I can comb it without any tangles. It is also super soft and has a nice smell to it. The product is not greasy and the main ingredients contain things like Vitamin E Oil, coconut oil, etc. All of the ingredients I have heard of so it's mostly natural. I have also noticed that while the smell is pretty pleasant, it doesn't linger or overwhelm the senses.The only reason this is not five star is because while my hair feels great for the first 1-2 days, after that, it is back to how it usually is and the tangles start coming back again.Overall, the immediate affects of this is great and you can feel a difference. However, it is not something that lasts very long.",4
i wanted a cheapie conditoner for cowashes. my hair is natural and it does a perfect job. i also uses to detangle my hair too and its a great conditioner. cannot beat the price for this.,5
"I took a chance and purchased a scent I was not familiar with.  I really like it and wear it on weekends.  Long lasting, too!  Prompt delivery and well packaged.  Thank you!",5
This is one of my favorite mascara I've been using for the past 4-6 months.  It makes my lashes look long and I don't get any clumps or smudging at all.  I use a lot of Revlon cosmetics and really love this mascara!,5
"I'm a big fan of herbal essences shampoos and conditioners.  They work well, smell great and work almost as well as salon brands for a fraction of the price.  I noticed my hair was feeling a little dry, so I decided to give this shampoo a try.Like other herbal essences products, Hello Hydration smells great, with a faint coconut odor.  The color is a crazy pearl-like teal.  After the second use my hair did feel less dry, but I also started losing clumps when I brushed it out. If I ran my fingers through my hair during the day, I lost a little more.  After a week I switched back to my old shampoo, and within a day or two the hair loss stopped.  I'm afraid to try the Hello Hydration shampoo again to see if it was a fluke, and I do feel the hair loss was related to this product.  I'll continue to use others in this series, but I'm steering clear of the pearlescent ones from now on.",2
this is so gorgeous. I will purchase it again for my sisters and my neices. Thank you very much!!! I really love it,5
"I love this! Especially the cute packaging. The perfume smells great, very cotton candy, tangy, warm scent with some sandalwood undertones too. Smells like absolute heaven. I loved the smell so much I bought the lotion and body wash as well. Get compliments on the scent daily. Try it!",5
"I've had acne for years. I'd been to several dermatologists and had been on EVERY rx acne treatment, and nothing had worked. A friend of mine gave me a g/c to see an aestheticism for my b-day, and she suggested the Jan Marini skin care line. I started using it, and everything changed! It's just amazing. Now I have clear skin that I have had for YEARS, and I love it. It was the best gift I ever got. It's completely worth the money, and you'll want to get it with the Bioclear Lotion. It's not actually a lotion, it's a gel that kills acne. Also, a great tip... When you wash your face, put the cleanser on with dry hands and a dry face. Massage it into your face for about 30 seconds, (you'll kind of start to feel it getting in your skin), then rinse, and repeat with wet hands and face. Then after you've dried your face apply the Bioclear Lotion. Your skin is going to be a little bit sad for a few weeks, and it may peel a bit, but then one day you'll wake up and have the best skin of your life! I promise! Good luck to anyone out there who is super frustrated with acne. I hope you find this and it helps you. Having great skin really does change your life, and you will have it if you use Jan Marini products. Give them a try!",5
"I knit, crochet and otherwise make a lot of hats, mostly Juliet type close fitting caps. This head form is perfect for blocking hats that are made to fit to the head. It is exactly what I wanted, great size and shape. I had been looking at a milliner's form which was hundreds of dollars....but this is just what I needed for a fraction of the price!",5
"I like this cooling version vs. the thermal effect one. I have been using this for a few months, it is not a miracle, but noticed it is does have some smoothing effect.",5
"I love all Holika BBs, with the exception of the shimmery one.  I used the purple moisture one while on Accutane and my skin was dry with no issues.  I've used the acne green/blue one prior to Accutane and now I use the regular orange one!  They are all very similar and I honestly don't know that I could tell them apart from each other, aside from purple being more moisturizing, the acne one being more drying and having a tea tree smell, and this one being pretty basic.  They all appear to have the same color and consistency as well as coverage.I have found that applying this with your fingers will result in a thicker application.  I use one of those beauty sponges (a knock off of those expensive ones!) and it covers much thinner, which I prefer.  It makes the cream last longer and I can still &#34;build&#34; the coverage.",5
I had to reorder this product(since the first person i ordered it from never sent it) I like it for what i am using it for but it leaks some,4
"Here's a review coming from a guy who cares about hygiene. I remember using these strips when they first came out over 10 years ago, and they worked great- almost half of my blackheads would get removed each time I'd use one of these! Over the last couple of years though, something's happened to the strips, and while they still work well, only about a third of my blackheads get removed with one strip.These strips are easy to use, and as long as you -follow the directions-, you shouldn't be having any problems. Get your nose wet, and with dry hands, place the strip on your nose, covering the area where most of the problem blackheads are. Leave it on there for 10-15 minutes (when the strip has hardened), and then peel it at the sides. Examine it closely, and you're sure to see a bunch of junk that it sucked out of your pores. It's actually fascinating to look at, and beats pinching your nose, getting one blackhead out at a time.But like I mentioned, these won't completely get rid of them, and I've always had a hard time getting the blackheads on the sides of my nose, so you might want to look into other products or ask a specialist. But for a casual person who just wants their nose to look a little better, I highly recommend these. 'not a bad price either on here!",4
"The InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Cream was great in conjunction with their under eye gel treatment. After several weeks of using both twice daily, my face looks and feels amazing. My fine lines have faded and my darker spots have also lightened up. I love their products because they are so effective and they don't break out my skin. I have sensitive combination skin and have a very hard time finding products that go well with my skin type without containing tons of chemicals! I have used the InstaNatural brand for months now and I am completely satisfied",5
"This item was a gift and was well received however, a second purchase probably will not be made with this exact color scheme.",3
"Love the packaging.  These tubes are very convenient to keep in a purse.  Watch how many times you spin the bottom of the tube to release the product because if you are not paying attention, you can easily go overboard and have oil leaking over the pen and all over your hands. Wasting is not a good idea with these as not much oil comes in the tubes. Misspellings on the packaging are hilarious!!! Not a fool, of course these are not manufactured by OPI, but the price is right and the packaging clever.  Will consider buying again.",5
"It simply washed right out after one wash. Whats the use of that?! Waste of my money. GRRRRR not happy about that!!  There was no hint of color after I showered, none at all. Not even exagerating here.",1
"An overall great brush holder. My only complaint is that it is difficult to close the brush holder over top of brushes, and at times, the top crushes and smooshes brushes, damaging bristles.The quality is excellent and worth spending a bit extra to have a hard brush case versus a brush roll, which doesn't protect the brushes as well.",4
What a steal! This product is just like a professional. Who knew that there would be such a difference from the ones you get at walmart. Cuts drying time in half!,5
It goes onto the scalp clear. Does not leave a residue and it's ver light. You can apply straight to the scalp or put into your hands and rub on hair. I have short permed hair and it works great to moisturize my scalp without having to sacrifice losing my curls.,4
love the leppord print and the case has enough room for everything. The top is also removable. Awsome case. I love it,5
"I almost couldn't stop stroking my hair to write this review, it looks so shiny and straight.Seriously, I am genuinely impressed with this flat iron. I typically am a wash-and-go type of girl, with an occasional spruce and curl for a night out on the town. I often don't even blow-dry my hair, but I really liked this device. I have very fine hair with a bit of a wave. It sometimes starts to look a little frizzy around the ends.I received this product through Amazon Vine, and didn't expect that it would make any difference. However, days that I use it, people ask me if I got a hair cut/color, and compliment my hair. It definitely makes my hair look healthier, straighter, and it brings out a shine.The flat iron is easy to use - it heats up almost instantly, and in 6 or 7 passes, I've gone through my hair. It barely takes more time than brushing. It has adjustable temperatures for different hair types. While I probably should be using the low or medium setting, I find the best results with the medium or medium-high. The cord is on a swivel, so it's easy to use on either side.So, the end result is that I'm unexpectedly happy with the product and wish I'd tried one sooner!",5
These gloves help remove the moisture from my curly hair without causing frizz.  They are a little awkward because they are very wide and the closure is tight on my large hands.,4
"I was on a hunt for a peach gel polish. I was disappointed after purchasing the new Gelish Morning Dew color. Morning Dew was straight up Halloween orange. I don't know how they thought it was great for the new 2013 Spring launch. Anyway, this IBD color is great; pretty. I haven't found anything close to this color. Great color as an addition to my collection. IBD is one of my favorite gel brands that doesn't disappoint in consistency and in wear. I'll try to add a pic soon.",5
"I love this eyeliner. Stores usually don't have this color tho, so I had to order online! It stays on all day but washes off easily.",5
"I was mistaken in selecting this item, I was under the impression it would enhance the hair drying experience , but it did not.",2
I've had this cleansing brush for about 2 months and I love it.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and so soft.  I was debating between purchasing this or the clarisonic and Im so glad I I got this one and saved myself some money!,5
"I picked this up for my wife, so this review is based on her experience not mine. She has medium thickness blond hair that has decent natural shine already. She has experimented with various hair products for both shine and straightening since her hair has a slight wave to it that she likes to eliminate for certain hair styles.After using this for a few days, she found that it did in fact produce a more robust shine, even using a very small portion of the cream. The shampoo and conditioner are high quality, definitely as nice as the more expensive hair products she's used in the past.Overall she thought the results were nice, but not amazing. When I asked if she'd use it again, she gave it a solid 'maybe'",3
"Great adhesive!  I thought it would be difficult to work with, but it wasn't.  It didn't take too long to dry, but stayed pliable long enough for me to adjust and readjust my lashes.",5
"I always wait before sharing a review for skincare products because realistically it takes time to see results. Well, I got my order fast - no problem there. The bottle's dated 4/28 so I think I got it around the 1st of May. A full month later and I see no difference at all. Nothing.But now I wonder if I'm using enough or not. Some seemed to mention a bottle lasts about a month. Well I've got about 2/3 a bottle left. But I've followed the instructions exactly. It says start with about 5 or 6 drops in the morning. I use a little more than that sometimes.So I'll finish the bottle just because I have it, but I don't know if the next step for me is to try the other formula they have, I forget what it's called but it's the one with Ferulic acid. I'm African-American and that should have nothing to do with its effectiveness, but perhaps it will take longer to see results.Hoping to see the results so many rave about. Oh well, nothing hurts a try. I'll be back at the end of June. And TODAY June 2nd, I've taken a photo of my clean face to compare and see if I see any difference.Will report back.",1
"this product was great, it is exactly the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for",5
I was lucky enough to receive this to review and I love it. I saw a definite difference in my puffiness and crow's feet but I didn't really see a difference in my dark circles. But I really like this cream!,5
I've been interested in learning how Phytoceramides can benefit my skin so I thought I would give Bodishape's formulation a try. It's been gentle on my stomach so far and I haven't noticed any side effects. I've already noticed a considerable change in my skin- it's absolutely glowing. I'm also glad that this supplement contains natural ingredients that I can feel confident ingesting. Thanks for the great product.,5
"I got so tired of looking at my scaly legs that I began looking at products that could help bring some moisture back in an easy way. Olay Body Wash is a good solution.  After one week of washing with it I can tell that my skin is looking better. And the body was is pleasant to use.  It has a light pleasant smell, the bottle is easy to open, the content pours out easily.  The three pack is a pretty economical way to buy this product.  The bottle is 23.6 oz and is 10 inches tall.  I am attaching a photo of the bottle next to the ruler.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  ""Online Price Alert"".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on ""online price alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.Overall, I am pleased with the product and recommend it.",5
"I have been using the Clarisonic for a few years now with great results but, after it took really nasty spill down the stairs while I was packing for a business trip I was in search of a cheaper option. I heard great things about the Olay Pro X so I gave it a shot. It DOES NOT compare to the Clarisonic on any level!CHARGING - The clarisonic comes with a neat charging dock that just magnetically snaps on. The Olay Pro requires batteriesWATERPROOF - The Clarisonic is waterproof... the Olay Pro is NOT, it is water resistant. This basically means that the Olay can accidently get a little wet but, has to be dried off immediately. Seems really odd that they wouldn't make a device that is supposed to get wet, waterproof. I leave my Clarisonic in the shower and never had a problem. If water sits in the batteries in the Olay then the batteries corrodeTIMING - The Clarisonic automatically turns off(you can turn it back on) at the end of the recommended cleansing time so you don't over cleanse your face. Olay Pro does notCLEANSING - Clarisonic "" has 300 movements per second to gently, yet thoroughly remove 6X more makeup and 2X more dirt and oil than cleansing with your hands alone"" The Olay Pro only rotates in a circle, no vibration. The bristles are also coarse and irritating to my skin. The Clarisonic gives you a better clean feeling. There is a reason dermatologists, estheticians and spas use the Clarisonic and not the OlayVERSATILITY - The Mia has several different options for cleansing brushesThe Mia is about $119 and I have seen them on sale for about $80. I recommend you give the Mia a shot. If you feel it's not worth the price it is 100% refundable through Amazon. In my opinion, don't skimp when it comes to skin care. The Mia is by far a better product.",2
"I have read other reviews about the product stinging.  And yes, the first time I used this there was a stinging sensation. However, I had just had acrylics taken off and my nails had been filed and almost ruined my nail bed.  The second time I used this a few weeks later there was no burning sensation and it has definitely made my nails stronger!",4
I love the small end for individual designs and the large one for full nail designs.  It has a metal scraper but I do not see it scratching my plates at all! worth the 5 dollars no problem!,5
"This should be the only soap everyone in the world should use. I've been through so many products, I can't even begin to describe my disappointment. I just figured I was the problem. But then I saw the results of this soap on my best friend over the course of 3 months, and decided to try it. I've decided to wait 3 months myself to see if it works.And it does! It tones the skin, makes it smoother,  and best of all, it does fight acne.I decided to try it as a body soap and my boyfriend started commenting on my skin's smoothness and glow after the first week. I tried it as a shampoo and my hair has gotten so much thicker, and so much stronger.I know it's been working because I stopped using it for one night and my skin broke out again. It's best used twice a day, and for even better results, use it with a mud masque twice or thrice a week. It works miracles, trust me.",5
"I'm a shampoo and conditioner junkie and I like to try different products from different companies. I was very surprised on how great this conditioner works on my hair. My hair is thick, curly, frizzy and sometimes unruly. Since I have been using this on a constant basis I have seen massive improvement on my hair. My hair is easy to comb, no tangles, little to no frizz, smells great, my hair is smooth and soft. I love how the keratin seal the hair cuticles from the outside leaving my hair soft and shiny.  The conditioner is not to heavy and works up a nice lather. After I blow dry my hair and style it, it looks so shiny and healthy. The best thing about this conditioner is that all hair type can use it and achieve beautiful hair. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody who is looking for healthy and shiny hair at an affortable price.",5
Very pretty & lot's of different shapes. Is kind of thick but still okay if you are going to stack other smaller ones on top of it.,5
"I was debating on whether or not to invest in one of these and I  am glad I did.  I love shellac manicures, but they are so expensive and it is not always easy to get an appointment when I want.  The dryer came super quickly, but there really isn't much in the way of directions.  Thanks much to previous poster advising that you can open the bottom of the dryer to remove the film and insert the bulbs.  I would just like to add that to open the dryer on the bottom you have to push in the tabs for it to open.  It is also a bit larger then I expected, but it will accommodate both hands or feet without any problems.  They dryer works great.  I used it to give myself a shellac manicure and it did a great job of curing the nails.  The timer runs from 90 to 300 seconds and there is also a fan button if you wish to use it.  I am very pleased with this product.",5
This product is awesome. I had trouble with the Shellac peeling off after a week or so. I used this primer after prep and I am thoroughly impressed. The Shellac stays on two weeks with no peeling or chips. This was the missing link to the process. Super fast shipping and this is now a must have item. I will continue to order.,5
"I normally use bath and shower products from Crabtree & Evelyn and The Body Shop. This body wash isn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.The scent is mild. I would have preferred a stronger papaya smell. The scent pretty much rinses off in the shower.I like the pump bottle, and I also like the consistency of the product. There's not much lather, but that's not a huge selling point for me.Frankly, I didn't notice that it did much moisturizing. I have very dry skin, especially this time of the year, and I don't think the body wash helped much.All in all, it's a pleasant enough product that I will use until it's empty. However, I don't plan on replacing my usual body washes for it.",4
"So soft and the quality is amazing. They are just like my other ecotools brushes. Not fakes. The angled eyeliner brush is thin which is great for putting on gel eyeliner,",5
"I see several other people have experienced similar stinging as I did. I must be highly sensitive to one or more of the chemicals used in these Restoraderm products, because most reviewers love the lotion and I didn't see any other reviewers mention the type of issue I experienced with the body wash.During a recent outbreak I decided to try Restoraderm Body Wash, and when I applied it to my face and torso I noticed a bit of tingling, not quite stinging, it was just strange. I've previously used body washes by Aveeno, Alba, Nature's gate and Yes To Carrots, with no ill effects. After drying off I applied Restoraderm Skin Moisturizer (which I'd also never used before) to my hands and inside of left elbow. After about 7 minutes my hands began to get irritated and burn, and then my inner left elbow began to itch and burn. They continued to worsen, and after 15 minutes I washed off every area where I'd applied the lotion. There was almost immediate relief and the stinging dissipated. I applied one of my other lotions and there was no such stinging. The next day I repeated the process with the Restoraderm body wash and lotion, and had the same problems.The manufacturer's phone number isn't listed anywhere on the bottles, nor on cetaphil.com, so I had to search for a phone number. I called Galderma (the mfgr) and they put me in touch with a nurse who took a report of my experience; She gave no indication as to what may have caused the stinging. Since then I've only used  Aveeno Skin Relief and Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil body washes, and have used Aveeno, Yes To Carrots, Neutrogena and Eucerin lotions, and have had no adverse effects whatsoever. I received a packet of papers from Galdeena in which they wanted me to give them more information, including a list of the medications I take, but I'm not giving them my personal or medical information so I threw them away. They also sent a check to reimburse me for the body wash and the lotion.",1
"It is light, you don't feel your hair all greasy. What I don't like is the fact that is a 3 pack. At times I just need one, because it lasts for over 4 or 5 months.",4
the shape is just pretty the heart is just lovely! and the colors are pretty for every day use and it comes with everything you need!,5
"I have straight, silky, frizzy, normal to oily hair. I am always trying new products because my hair seems to respond better when I alternate products and I keep finding new favorites. This unfortunately, was not one of them.I tried this treatment mask out after using Clear Damage & Color Repairing Shampoo. I have been using this shampoo for awhile now and love it. My hair is normal to oily and I was a little worried that the Shea in this treatment mask would make my hair oily. It did the complete opposite: it made it feel so incredibly dry and stiff. My hair was actually ""crunchy"" as it was drying. It did improve a little as it dried (although this may have been because I wouldn't stop running my fingers through my hair because it felt so gross). I do admit that it gave my hair a little bit of extra volume, but it wasn't worth the sacrifice of the feel of my hair. I couldn't wait to wash my hair again later the same day (something I normally don't do) and it took about 2 washes to feel back to normal.This treatment may work well for some people, but it did not work with my straight, silky Caucasian hair. I can not recommend this product.",2
"This is a pleasant lotion. It goes on smooth, smells  of lemon and herbs, and contains organic ingredients and is 100% natural and synthetic free, its also made in the USA.My first impression of it is that it looks sort of generic. Nothing really exciting in the bottle or the label, unless its the impressive list of ingredients. If I saw this in the store, I probably would pass it over, just for sheer plainness of the packaging.  I also don't think it smells like creamsicle at all. More like.. Lemongrass. I think saying it is scented like artifical orange is way misleading.Overall, this smells okay, goes on smooth and moisturizes, I liked it but didn't love it.",4
"I've never been disappointed with the lip liner, it has good staying power with lipstick and always looks nice. Not dry like other liners.",5
My wife loves it. she states it stays on and applies well. she is very happy ever since she bought this item and does not like the feel of the others she has tried.,5
I needed some new files and I wanted something that wouldn't wear out in a week.  These are amazing!  They work really well and they're much more durable than emery boards.,5
"I just received this yesterday and have used it twice already!  I styled my 5-year olds hair with it this morning as well as my own and I love this tool!  It gives natural looking, wavy textured hair!  And, it holds!  I will have to wash my hair to get the curls out, that's how good it stays put!  It's a little awkward to get used to at first, but the heatproof glove really helps with using the tool!  It's money well spent, that's for sure!  I will be wearing my hair wavy/curly a lot more often thanks to the Remington T-studio Curling Wand! :)",4
"I have used Sauve hair care products for years and have never been disappointed. This shampoo was no exception. It has a clean, soft smell, lathers up well and leaves hair clean. A+++ in my book.",5
"First, this product got shipping quite quickly.  I placed the order on Friday afternoon, and received it on Monday.  Amazing.Secondly, it smells like a dark chocolate bar.  Delicious.  It looked weird when I opened it, I thought maybe it had molded and formed little colonies, but its just the way it is.  It wasn't mold, just the regular shape.  The product itself is super hard, I am using this to make deodorant, so I ended up scraping it out with a metal spoon to add to my mixture.  You could probably microwave it, but I do not own a microwave.  The product will melt on your skin when rubbed in.Good purchase, good price, would buy again.",5
"This is another one of those good products created by InstaNatural. For a while, I started getting worried about receiving so many different skin care products, but this one was welcome for a try.This Youth Express Eye Gel works well when applied around the eyes. It did a remarkable job in tightening the loose skin around my eyes, but did very little for the dark circles there. According to one skin expert I spoke with; I have a natural dark tone around the eyes, and no product manufactured will have any effect there.When applying InstaNatural&#8217;s Youth Express Eye Gel, I noticed the fresh smell of cucumber. Low and behold it is one of the ingredients. Of course, cucumber has been used for years to tighten skin around the eyes, and it is a welcome ingredient for this easy to apply skin product.Overall the product worked well for me, but it pales in comparison to other InstaNatural skin care products.",4
"Probably one of the BEST purchases I have EVER bought on Amazon. I LOVE this straightener. I have thick hair.....THICK. It takes me normally like an HOUR to straighten my hair, I can actually get my hair done in like 30 minutes! It does not burn my hair, and it's the fastest straightener I have EVER seen get hot and ready in a minute. AWESOME product! BTW - the buttons never get in the way of my hand.....",5
I bought these to take on vacations when I travel as I didn't want to bring my full set of hair products so I wanted a mini dryer and curing iron and this is perfect for the days that I don't want to leave my hair wet and curly I can now blow dry it out and still curl it for the more polish nigh out when I want it.love them.,5
"I bought this mirror based on positive feedbacks..well,now I can write my own feedback, and its negative-I did not like the mirror at all-I am not even sure that it s made from glass, not clear to see and changing from one to another is a chore. I will return it to the store and get something more stable. Besides, it was a poor quality and too big to attach to the wall mirror.",2
"I have been a big fan of Burt's Bees lemon butter cuticle cream for years, and was very happy to find this little hand healing kit.The beeswax and banana hand creme is super creamy & highly scented, but the scent dissipates pretty quickly once you start massaging it into your hands.  It leaves a slightly greasy feel on your hands, but that's Ok with me.I follow up and application of the hand creme with massaging the cuticle balm into my nails.  This also has a pretty strong scent to it, but it is a little nicer than the banana, it is more natural smelling (even though both products are nearly 100% natural)Burt's Bees products are the only ones that have been able to heal my very dry hands and fingers.",5
Bought a similar brush from a name brand at target for $17. My sister wanted one as well but didn't want to spend that much on a makeup brush. I bought this for her. It's quality matched my much more expensive brush. Great purchase,5
"I love this product.  It heats up and goes on very warm, and does a good job keeping my complexion clear. It is blue in color and thick in consistency.",5
"I'm not sure exactly what this does, but I do like my skin better in the morning after I've used this the night before.  Been using Olay products almost 40 years.  Started with basic Oil of Olay, but now I'm using the lotion for daytime with SPF.A dermatologist told me long ago not to spend a lot of money on fancy creams and lotions.  It was a waste.  He recommended Albolene for cleansing.  I started using Olay on my own.  I have great skin, especially for my age.  And I don't spend an arm and a leg.",5
I want this item... Im adding this to my wish list for x-mas. I love the cosmetics so I need to carry them in style.,5
"This lotion leaves your skin super soft and amazingly moisturized. It has a thick consistency; however, it goes on very light and DOES NOT clog your skin and leave a thick coat like some lotions do. I believe it does firm and smooths the skin's texture...have purchased again and again and again...",5
"So I tried this, I mean I had my wife try this because nothing is working.  Oddly she is 40 years old and still gets pimples...which as a woman drives her crazy. Anyway the term ""rapid"" for this Clearasil product means 4 hours your pimples are less puffy, read, and visible.  I had my wife try this at night before bed 2 nights in a row, did she wake with less (noticeable) pimples...the answer is...wait for it...no.  But she is not giving up hope as she is willing to try this application for a whole week to see if her skin needs to acclimate to this cream.The good news is with 10% benzoyl peroxide, it did not burn her skin.+++Update 4/18/2013+++++Well 10 days later and the wife's skin really hasn't changed for the better.  So as I said perhaps good for some but not for all.",3
"I guess the argan oil ingredient is the key to making this product work so well.  I think it works better than other products I've used to make my hair stand down without looking slick.  The fragrance is ok - I don't really like or dislike it, although it's probably a little too feminine for a typical guy yet nobody said anything to me about it.There are other products with argan oil that sell for a lot more per ounce, and they probably have a similar amount of argan oil in them.  However, I found an even cheaper alternative - hemp oil.  Hemp oil can be purchased pretty cheaply and so far it has also worked well on my hair just to keep it down without making it look slick.",5
"I really wanted a styling tool that would not damage my hair as much as a traditional curling iron, and would give me some easy loose curls for everyday use.  I saw on tv a few different stylists using a wand type of curler, and decided to give it a try.  I really like the results of using this wand.  I have longer hair about 6 inches past my shoulders and am of asian descent, so my hair is very straight naturally.  This tool works great to give me loose flowing wavy curls, for an everyday look.  In the past I had purchased a babybliss curling iron and was very pleased.  Babybliss is Conair's &#34;elite&#34; line of styling tools.  Basically, I have found that they are often similar products rebranded, but some of the babybliss items really do seem to be much higher end with more quality of materials.  Either way, this particular product was a good value and did what it should with minimal damage to my hair.Always before heat styling I use Morracanoil to protect my hair.  I found for the best results, after washing my hair, add morracanoil I let it air dry to about half of its wetness or I blow dry on low heat with my head upside down until half wet.  Then add a little bit of styling product and then curl using the wand.  I get nice loose flowing hair that I can run my hands through and will stay with volume and curls throughout the day.",5
"I have one of those really nice wall mounted, lighted, magnifying mirrors in the bathroom now....Pros and cons to this decision, obviously!  Every pore in your face looks like our local, poorly maintained county roads around here, but it DOES afford you the opportunity to really get a good look at your skin!At 50, my biggest complaint is the lack of elasticity, ever increasing pore size, wrinkles and dryness.I also have VERY sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful what I use AND my skin has always been very, very dry and getting worse with the years.I debated for weeks on this product line - putting it in my cart, taking it out, putting it back in...Finally pulled the trigger and thought I've spent more than this on high quality products before and had only minimal results.Also, because of the dryness, I have to use WAY more product than the average person.I got the serum and the eye cream at the same time so was able to start this routine with both products.  Actually, they were nice enough to send samples of the face cream with the orders, so I started with all three at once.I never expected to see such a dramatic and immediate difference -- with the first use!  I cannot say that about any of the other multitudes of creams and serums I've spent big $$$ on!After cleansing and toning, I applied the serum first.  WOW!  One application of a small amount and my skin  felt and looked amazing - even before I applied the eye cream and  face cream!I've used this for just a short time, but the magnifying mirror don't lie, baby!The reduction in the size of my pores is probably the most dramatic result so far AND the texture on my skin is SSSOOOO much better!I can't wait to see what happens after extended use with actual results like these.  I just ordered the face cream since I'm about out of the samples they sent.I realize the cost on this is up there, but really not that much more than many of the high end brands BUT I really can use less of these products so it's a wash for me.I'm hooked!  When you've had problem skin all your life, it's exciting to find something that actually works and does what it says it will do.So glad I found this line!!!",5
"I had purchase a small tube of this a couple yrs back at &#34;Whole Foods&#34;. The 2oz tube was much more expensive THERE than this 4oz.!! I used it on & off then just forgot about it. After moving, I found the tube amount my things & decided to try it again. I am in my early 40's ( though I never admit it!)  & let's just say I'm noticing the affects of AGE on my body , lol. My &#34;monthly&#34; is all whacked out, it's either very heavy & lasts for 7-8 days, or spotty for just a few days! I get twice some months, oh what a joy.... ;(  So, figuring these symptoms, I thought maybe using this cream may help? Since we lose estrogen as we age, why not replace it, maybe it will reverse some of the issues of LOW estrogen! Well, I started using what I had left of my 2oz tube. Within about 2weeks I notice a weird feeling in my breast. Not only were they a lot more sensitive , as they were in my 20's, but they were..uummm... Bigger?? They had a feeling of fullness, I remembered them feeling like this in my teens & thru 20's just before I'd get my &#34;monthly&#34;. But I had not had that happen in a LONG time, especially after having my daughter 10 yrs ago. I had a full D cup, when I couldn't breast feed her, they quickly DEFLATED! I cried for only a few months, .. Now left with still a D cup yet instead of a FULL, I was now a LONG!! ;(  My only recourse has been the PUSH ( way) UP bra. I sleep in them! Well, anyway, this cream somehow was giving me a bit of my lost fullness back. Don't know how, why, don't care.. I quickly bought this 4oz tube off Amazon at a much cheaper price, as I have almost always found with everything- Go Amazon!  So,I put this on my...ummm.. Well, Breasts! Why put it on my arm or leg & wait for it to work it's way to the area I want it it affect?!  So alittle tweaking on my part w/directions- I use it 2x a day ( if I remember!) & apply it directly on my breasts. If it keeps doing what it's doing ( sensitive &full) I'll buy STOCK in the company!  Yea, I recommend it... ;)",5
Definitely makes concealing acne blemishes and any other issue much easier. The handle fits comfortably in your fingers and the brush is made of soft fibers.,5
"Since Covergirl did away with the mascara in the dark gray bottle, I had to try something new.  I have used the old formula and the old brush for years and years.  The old brush looks very similar to this one, with the little pointy rubber nubs, but it's about half the size.I have very long, fine lashes, so I need volume.  This was very gummy and sticky.  I hated that the brush is SO FAT.  It doesn't allow for controlled, detailed application and it gets all over my eyelids.  Because it's gummy and sticky, it just smears when I try to wipe it off.  It makes a mess, and I hated that part.It takes a few uses before the mascara gets to a nice consistency.  I did like the consistency and it did stick onto my eyelashes a really well and made them appear thicker.  I tried using my old brush, but the mouth of this bottle is much larger, and it wouldn't wipe the excess off the old brush.  So I am stuck using two brushes:  The one it came with to try and apply it, and then my old brush to de-tangle and get the mascara all the way from the root to the tip of the lashes.  The brush it comes with is so fat, I can't apply it to the tips of my lashes because they bend back and touch my eyelid and I end up getting it all over my eyelid.  Plus it just 'pushes' on the lashes, the individual rubber nubs don't get in between the lashes to separate and apply between the lashes like the old brush.Still searching for the perfect brush/mascara combination.....sigh.",3
"I did appreciate having something that is marketed for the scalp as well as the hair.  My scalp feels dry and itchy at times, probably from swimming so much.  This is a treatment that is used once per day for seven days, to condition hair that is badly damaged.I did use this as instructed, using an entire tube every day for seven days, then rinsing and lightly shampooing.  I found that these gave my hair new life and body and shine.  My hair came back to life.  This is a bit heavy, and is only for people like me with damaged, dry, unruly hair that needs serious help.  I found that using this every day for seven days, the full tube each time, soaked my hair with conditioners.  If you try this, I recommend using it as the instructions say.  It is very effective.  I feel it is an intensive treatment regimen that does work wonders if used as directed.",4
"New Lysol Touch of Foam Antibacterial Hand Wash is not what one might expect! It is obvious that Lysol put a great deal of thought into researching the latest item in its product line, and I am excited that BzzAgent gave me an opportunity to try it first by providing me with a free full-sized sample.When I thought ""Lysol"" I thought ""bleach;"" however, the Creamy Vanilla Orchid scent has no underlying odor of bleach, which can be unpleasant. While the perfume is decidedly feminine, it is not so much so that it deterred my fianc&eacute; from trying or liking it. Other available scents include Rose & Cherry in Bloom and Wild Berry Bliss. Each scent has antimicrobial properties built in to protect the pump and resist odor-causing bacteria. (Additionally, I have never seen a purple-colored soap before, so I can envision this product fitting in very well with certain decor themes.)With ""bleach"" on my mind, I also anticipated having very dry skin after I used the Hand Wash. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while it kills 99.9% of germs on contact and offers 10x more germ protection than the leading competitor, its moisture-enriched micro-bubbles leave my hands feeling soft and comfortable after every wash. The soap was not greasy, as I expected; on the contrary, it foamed so richly that I could see the non-drip lather that allowed me to turn my palm over without the foam falling off!New Lysol Touch of Foam Antibacterial Hand Wash is certainly not what I expected! Because it is soft on skin, while still being hard on germs, I am still in awe that this product is not from the shelves of a price-inflated bath and body retailer!",4
"Insta Natural 100% Pure Argan Oil from Morocco is the perfect product for skin and hair. It absorbs into the skin so quickly and leaves it silky smooth, with no oily or sticky residue. My skin has the dryness, wrinkles, and brown spots that come with a very long life that has been well lived, and it is also super sensitive. Finding something that alleviates the dryness and doesn't irritate has been a life-long quest. And the quest is over: I found argan oil.Insta Natural Argan Oil comes in a beautiful dark blue glass bottle (always buy argan oil in dark colored glass to prevent degradation) and with a dropper in the top. I find that half a dropper of oil is all I need to cover face and neck, and it's an ideal moisturizer alone or under makeup. It's also a marvel for hands and cuticles that have the ""dishpan"" look.Organic, cruelty free, preservative and fragrance free...and something must be said about its unique aroma. It's an aroma that becomes more appealing with time. I have grown to absolutely love it. Insta Natural's oil is a bargain at any price, and this 4 oz. bottle will last a long time, with each drop of treasured oil absorbed and appreciated.",5
I have coarse curly hair that I straighten.  This oil makes it feel so soft and smooth.  I also love the smell.,5
"I was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing. Eucerin and Cetaphil. Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both. I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin, the thing about Cetaphil (specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former. It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. I bought this to give her a sample of as well. She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across. I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera. At this price for two jars, it's a steal and depending on how liberal you use it, but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person. Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE.",5
"I'm not sure what the poor-review whiners are complaining about except for maybe their lack of basic know-how of putting on make-up, which is obviously a user error and has nothing to do with this product.Yes, this is a cream.  It's not a powder.  However, if you use a course make-up brush (and not a fine brush) the you'll be able to apply this product with ease.  You shouldn't use your finger...not a brilliant plan.  A course brush is usually very cheap and one that you don't care about ruining because the color will set within the bristles and you won't be able to easily use other colors with the same brush.  It almost has the consistency of a cheap paint brush you'd buy at a craft store.  That's what you should use with this product.I love this purple.  I'm very picky about purple eyeshadow.  This one is awesome because it has a hint of indigo in it.  It's absolutely stunning and perfect for daytime as well as evening application.  And no, it doesn't last 24 hours.  Anyone stupid enough to think any make-up will last 24 hours except for permanent markers or paint is a fool for thinking this way.  Plus, who the hell wants make-up to last 24 hours.  Hello?!  You have to take a shower sometime!This is a very pretty eyeshadow and definitely a unique color that is hard to find in other products.  Chanel used to carry a purple like this one in a powder eyeshadow and I can't find it anymore.  This is the closest I've come to that same Chanel purple.",5
"The bangs get messy really easily and it's hard to comb them out so they're straight and neat. The hair is not as curly as the picture, but I can fix that by recurling it. The color is a more grayish shade compared to the auburn hair in the picture. It feels like real hair, but the bangs are a little shiny for my taste. If you want a good wig, this is a pretty decent deal! (:",4
I have used several different brands of hyaluronic acid gel.  This is the worst!  It's very thin.  It feels like you've put water on your skin.  I tried reading the ingredients.  The printing was so small I had to get a magnifying glass to read them.  Hyaluronic Acid is the 4th ingredient.  There's too much of other ingredients to get the best from this mixture.  Good hyaluronic acid will make your skin feel tight right after you put it on.  This did not.  My skin feels incredibly soft after using &#34;good&#34; hyaluronic acid.  This one didn't make it feel that way.  I will not be buying this.  There are much better brands out there.,2
I absolutely love this nourishing moisturizing conditioner. It smells so good and has tons of slip. This conditioner is second to none. I ordered this on a whim and realized that it's one of the best choices for my African American textured hair. My hair was very bouncy and noticeably healthy looking. I am now going to order the shampoo. I'm so glad I made this purchase.,5
"this rolling makeup case is so amazing! its great obviously to take on the go. when you're on location, or when you just leave for a long trips. its a must have for suree!",5
I love Dominican Magic hair products! They leave your hair soft and manageable. I have the leave in conditioner and it makes my hair soft. Also smells good! Use the whole line to achieve maximum results! You won't be sorry!,5
This product really reduces acne over night.  I recommend this especially for teens.  This takes care of acne without drying out their skin.,5
"I had to shop Amazon for a favorite lip color. I love this product but they must have discontinued it as I cannot find it anywhere in my local stores.  The Naturally Nude is just the right shade if you need a little bit of a darker lip color without looking to garrish. The anit-aging serum doesn't hurt either, gives my lips a boost.",4
"I wear this when I am home or for a quick trip out. If I'm longer, I use it after another 'matte' foundation.",4
"THE RED SHATTER WAS THE FIRST POLISH I USED AFTER RECEIVING MY ORDER. IT HAS PERFORMED LIKE OPI SHATTER SHOULD AND HAS HELD UP WELL ON MY TOES, THANKYOU.",5
"These cute bags are wonderful! The hard outer case is perfect for protecting your items, I love the study handle and feet on the bottom that protects the case. This case is perfect as a carry-on bag to keep personal and valuable items close at hand. The optional shoulder strap is also a plus for hands-free carrying.",5
I bought these for a girls summer camp. The girls had a blast with them. They are exactly as described.,5
"they are lovely, the box is lovely, the colors are awesome, and i can use it all day, never slide",5
"I purchased this because I'm in Afghanistan and I still love to paint my nails. This is absolutely salon quality, I love it, using it once a week as a base coat and a top coat. It leaves my nails very glossy!",5
"I'm an African-American natural with 4a/4b hair. Like many of the other reviewers, I agree that this product is thick and the smell can be overwhelming. However, I use it as a sealant ONLY and so far nothing has compared to it...a phenomenal staple in my product line-up! I do not recommend this product as a daily hairdress or for any other uses other than sealing and maybe dry spots around edges or temple.",5
My experience was a bit rocky at first. I actually ordered these because I fell in love with Fast Track. When I got something in the mail it was only 3 bottles of polish with a note that says I got refunded for Fast Track as it was out of stock. Heart broken I quickly got over it because the rest of the collection is amazing. They look great in the bottles and when you put them on your nails they that much better. And they apply very nicely There was a bit of trouble with emails but in the end I was able to talk to someone about not getting the rest of the bottles. She was really nice and very apologetic. I got the bottles shortly after She said they sent. Even though this wasn't an idea experience with shipping I would definitely order from them again. So nice and understanding.,4
"I read all the complaints???? about this amazing product. Thinking, they are all using too much, or not applying it evenly. My curls are rocking and rolling and my 17 year old son with natural curls has stolen mine....so, here I am buying one for each of us. (((SMILES)))Do not know what the ""old"" CATWALK was like, or after browsing even found anything sub standard.If you rub it in your palms and then squeeze and scrunch your hair EVENLY, you WILL have ROCKING curls without the crunch of other stylers.My hair is shoulder length and I use exactly one single pump, and that is all I need. If your hair is longer, use one pump, scrunch and then if you really have missed the back of your head, use a tiny bit more....less is more, in my opinion.My hair salon sells it and the bottle is exactly the same. Saving a bundle purchasing it on AMAZON.",5
"Its OK, I like it, don't love love love it, but its thick and moisturizing the outcome though it hasn't changed my face or wrinkles much.  A lot of nightcremes will tighten and moisturize........this only moisturizes.",3
"I have used this product for about two months.The product does what it claims to do; it cleans your skin well. I haven't experienced any abnormally great results claimed by some Clarisonic users but my skin does feel cleaner after use. Honestly, some of the results people say they see are probably placebo effects because there is no scientific explanation for a lot of the ridiculous ""results"" so I'd read some of 5 star reviews with a grain of salt. I feel that people just want to over-justify spending >$100 on a face exfoliating cleansing system.Battery life is great. I can go almost a month without having to recharge it. The head is relatively sturdy and since I don't wear much make up, I won't be replacing it as often as it is recommended. The design and color options are fantastic!If it was cheaper, I'd give it 5 stars. I would recommend it just because your skin is too important to not clean thoroughly.",4
"First off, this whole line is a bit lighter than the pics and the bottom of the containers once on your eyes. That being said, it's a great &#34;tattoo&#34; eyeshadow! It stays put even when you rub your eyes. I love it!",5
"I have been using this bronzing powder for years and just now got around to reviewing it. It has a wonderful, subtle sheen, so it doesn't look flat and pasty, but also not too shiny. It's a beautiful brown-toned bronze, not orange (and my skin picks up orange very easily). I can't imagine using a different bronzer. This is the lighter version of the Nars bronzers, which is perfect for my fair/light skin. For darker skin, you would want the Casino color.",5
"I really like this cream, I would probably order this again, I also bought other products of oil of oly for other areas.",4
"with the rave going on the internet about this foundation, it was a must try. i like it. i intend using till it finishes but will move on to a new foundation. i would recommend it to anybody to give it a try because you might love it.",4
"I love this pencil and the color pay off is great. I use this to brighten up my eyeshadow colors, eyeliner, and sometimes as a base. This is a must have and it's really great.",5
"We live in a community with both very hard water and very strong winds. Combined, the two make for some terrible skin problems. In the colder months, I often find my hands and elbows to be irritated from being overly dry. My mom has long encouraged me to moisturize using straight Vaseline petroleum jelly, but I find that rather gross and icky feeling, no matter how effective it is. This Vaseline Total Moisture Body Lotion is just as good as petroleum jelly without the ick factor. The lotion is not overly thick, but does feel rather luxurious going on. It blends easily so that in the mere time it takes me to walk from the bathroom to the living room (of a fairly small house) the lotion is thoroughly absorbed into my skin and I don't have to wipe my hands on a paper towel to feel like their clean.In addition to the moisturizing properties of this lotion, I also enjoy the smell. The Cocoa butter scent is definitely there, but it's a fairly light scent as these things go. I don't smell like a bottle of suntan lotion, but I do smell pretty. The package size on this lotion is also rather generous. So, while it'll be quite a while before I need to restock, I will be doing it with the Vaseline Total Moisture in the Cool Radiant scent.",5
I've been using Jane Iredale for a long time and in times of financial hardships it's great to be able to find this on Amazon with a company that offers it at a good price and sends it within the ordered time. Good experience with a good product!,5
"I have mixed feelings about the idea of BB cream for the body.  On the one hand, summer is coming and I will start wearing clothes that show my arms and legs and a product that makes them look better has to be a good thing.It is the tinted part that I'm not so sure about.  At the beginning of the season I'll be pasty white (or at least as pasty white as someone with a medium dark Scandinavian complexion gets).  But this product doesn't give that much color when it is blended in -- it is very sheer.  And, though it doesn't show up on my darker winter clothes, I worry about stains on light and white colors.For me, I prefer a good untinted body cream and a self-tanning product if I need a little more color at the beginning of the season.This product has a fragrance but if it is not too close to my face, it doesn't bother me.",3
"I have yet to find an eye makeup remover wipe that actually works halfway decently, and these are no different. I tried these onMaybelline New York Eye Studio Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner, Blackest Blackand a waterproof mascara (I forget what brand) and it was pretty useless (see my uploaded photo). And I wiped and wiped and wiped and then folded it in half and specifically rubbed right on the remaining eyeliner and specifically grabbed my eyelashes through the pad...and ugh...I still had black eyes. They also feel VERY dry, which I would think makes it harder for them to work. And you'd need to use at least one per eye (both sides)--if not two--so a 30pk would only last you 1-2 weeks. I would not recommend these.",1
"I was pleased as this was sulfur soap which helps with my acne, but this particular brand has a very pungent fragrance. Since this is advertised as an acne treatment, and most acne people have skin and allergy problems to start with, the fragrance is totally unnecessary.",2
"My teenage son uses a lot of the AXE products, but he does have sensitive skin. When I got this face wash, he tried it right away, and said he loves it. He said that it has a very mild coconut scent, but it does leave his face feeling very clean. He actually used the phrase squeaky clean. He said that after using this foaming face wash, he doesn't want to go back to regular soap because it doesn't make his skin feel as clean as this does. So I will continue to buy this for him.",5
"The wife is trying out this Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst:  I found the lotion very nice.  It was not greasy on the skin, but soaked right in and left the skin feeling soft, moist-looking, and supple.  It has a light, fresh, pleasant fragrance with notes of spice and citrus that lasts practically all day.  I chose this lotion because of the vitamin contents(vit.B5 & vit.E), wondering if the Vitamin E that is purported to help damaged skin, helping with the healing process, would actually work. Is the jury still out on this concept?  I did notice that the lotion became sticky, almost waxy during the day - had to wash it off my palms before preparing meals.  Perhaps this was the STRATYS 3, suspended on my top layer of skin.  Overall, it is an acceptable moisturizing body lotion.  The bottle shape is comfortable, will not slip out of your hand.",4
"This flat iron is salon quality. So far, it straightens my natural kinky (4b/c texture) dead straight after a blow out. It's very sleek ans heats up quickly. It doesn't tug or plug my hair and after two or three passes my hair is tamed without that burnt, fried smell. Would highly recommend.",5
"The cologne arrived promptly, as promised!  The fragrance is not what I expected!  I will gift it to my granddaughter as I prefer a more sedate and traditional fragrance!  I will stick w/my Liz Taylor's Passion, that's my fav and, so far, remains so!",3
"This is a great blackhead remover, it's a lot like an old Revlon model I had a long time ago that they quit making. I find this style to be more effective than the type with the loop on the end. It lifts whiteheads and blackheads easily and helps blemishes heal faster.",5
"I ordered this &#34; for my &#34;tween&#34; grandaughter.  The colors are very vibrant, perfect for her age group.  She loves them and has a different color on each time I see her.  My only reservation is that they are not made in the US but seem to be ok, no skin or nail problems.",4
"My skin is really sensitive and I have to be extremely careful what I use on my face. This machine is great. I have only had it for about 2 weeks, my skin feels so cleaner and the skin's appearance has improved. It gives your skin a healthy glow.",5
"I was eager to try the new facial cleansers.  First off, they smell great, although it worries me what they had to do to get that smell.  I used it for the first time after being out all day.  I felt like I had to put a lot of effort into getting my makeup off.  After using this product, my face did not feel clean and I felt that I needed another product to complete the task.  This happened several times.I also find it confusing that you are told to use this product on your lashes and around your eyes, when it comes with a warning not to get it in your eyes?For these reasons, I don't feel comfortable with the product.  I would not purchase them.Jodie Marino Nachison, spouse",2
"I purchased this stamping set including the plates and I must say I am in love with it! I always get compliments on my manicure since I'm always changing colors and designs. The stamper is easy to use, but it does take some practice to make the perfect design, but DON'T give up, it took me awhile but now I got the hang of it. The scraper does the job well when it comes to taking off the excess nail polish off the plate and the holder holds my plate snuggly. I'm highly impressed. Don't hesitate on this purchase ladies and gentlemen!",5
I LOVE this eyeliner. It goes on so smoothly and has the best color payoff of any eyeliner I have ever used.  You can smudge it at first but once it drys it's not budging. Def a beauty product I will actually buy again.,5
works much better than other brands for stamping nail art. It's much thicker.,5
"Betty Dain Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, Boudoir, 4.32 Ounce:I have VERY thick long hair and this shower cap works great for me. It covers all of my hair; the band fits snugly to contain my hair and prevent water leaks around the edges. And it is comfortable to wear.",5
"Easier to use than cotton balls, these cotton squares seem to work well removing nail polish and make-up. I also use themn to clean keyboards and cameras.",4
"These wipes are great, but the definitely exfoliate so the key is not to rub the way you are used to having to rub with a normal face wipe. You have to be gentle. They do a great job for my wife as a makeup remover and are a nice way to quickly clean up at the end of the day for me. I like them because they don't have a scent and don't leave a lot of residue. I first started using them right as the cold weather was starting to dry me out. No more flakes and my face looks great (I do use a light moisturizer -Clinique Men's Lotion w/ SPF). I also like that these wipes are larger than most. You get more bang out of each one. I think they would even be good for camping, they're effective enough for that kind of grime. Do be careful not to wipe too hard, though, you will feel the difference.",5
"This is CND's new product, one week duration.  Nice not worrying about if nails or dry or not and chipping polish.",4
"My skin is aging, I have some brown spots and lines. I don't expect miracles, but do want improvement in my skin.This Rapid Tone Night Moisturizer has an accelerated Retinol SA which is a unique combination of Retinol SA, Glucose Complex and Hyaluronic Acid brought together, along with Vitamin C. This is a very unusual formula and to find retinol SA and Hyaluronic acid together with vitamin C is unheard of. These formulas work to help provide increased clarity and brighter skin.The info from Neutrogena tells us we'd will see results in one week. I didn't see much difference for at least a month. I did find this product did help to nourish and hydrate my skin. This is a light moisturizer, and if you have dry skin it may not be enough for you. The scent is clean and light. Heavily scented moisturizers really offend my senses, and this scent is just right.With the retinol and hyaluronic acid you might expect red and irritated skin. It may flake and that might be expected for the first couple of days to a week. It you continue to notice irritation,stop using it, it may be the combination of both ingredients that affect you. Try another brand and use judiciously. I have used retinol SA and hyaluronic acid products, so this product is perfect for me. With consistent use, I noticed improved smoother overall tone, diminished redness, and diminished look of fine lines. There is a more even tone and some fading of brown spots. The consistency of the night moisturizer is a little light for me, but it does seem to be effective. It may be the heavier night creams I have been using are not as effective.I would recommend using this product for at least a month before making any judgements about the effectiveness. This is very affordable for the amount and quality of ingredients, you can't go wrong.Recommended. prisrob 03-13-14",4
"I was using a Murad salicylic acid cleanser before this for a while, which was okay but it didn't do much to clear the minor breakouts I had. I decided to give this a try since it was a lot cheaper than Murad. It didn't take long to notice good results, and my face was finally starting to clear up. After about a month of using it, my face is pretty much free of blemishes. I'll still get a few occasionally ranging from minor to large and painful ones, however it's usually if I skip washing my face at night. I've gotten a lot of compliments about my clear complexion.However, the only downside is that it can be fairly irritating to my face, specially if I use a little too much. My skin will be somewhat red and have a slight burning sensation after I wash my face. Which I wasn't too shocked to experience, I do have pretty sensitive skin. I'm thinking about alternating using this cleanser with a more gentle cleanser. Bottom line, if you have mild-moderate acne and your skin isn't too sensitive, this product will most likely work for you. Definitely can't beat the price",4
they are so shiny and totally reusable! they give my nails a very dramatic look and I love it!!! you just have to keep an eye on where you put your hands cause I have a huge habit of sticking mine in my pockets and they will fall off if snagged.,5

"My hair curls very easy, at the lowest setting did nothing.. Actually no settings but the highest one worked. Made very loose curls and took long time holding to achieve them, my hair smelled like it was burning(which it was). My curls were gone in a matter of 2 hours. What a shame, I wanted big beautiful curls. I will keep using what works for me, the chi flat iron to make smaller curls, which last me 3 days. Returning this item.",1
"My stylist told me about this dryer as my hair is so fine and gets damaged by the dryer. This dryer makes a big difference and is worth the price. My hair is shiney and healthy now. Yes, it is a bit heavy but it dries your hair so fast you will not mind. Hold it like stylists do on the body, you can as it will not burn you.",5
"It feels like heaven on your hair, that's the only way I can describe it. I put it on right after I wash my hair and I swear it makes all the difference. It doesn't weight down my waves, it smells amazing and it makes my hair feel soft/look shiny. The only obvious con is the price T_T. Also, the bottle lasts a long time if you just use one or two pumps per use! (it depends on how often you wash your hair as well..I wash mine twice a week). If you're hesistant about the price, I get it. But all I have to say is that this very worth it and you won't regret it!",5
This is a beautiful blue and green glitter with a few specks of silver and pink mixed in too.  I got full coverage in three thin coats and it made for an awesome accent nail.  It also looks good as a topper with only one thin coat.,5
"this is my second bottle! i loved it since the first time i got it, my skin feels so fresh and clean after i use it. gonna keep buying it for sure!",5
"Can't really argue with all the reviews here.  Primer potion is truly an amazing eye primer by Urban Decay.  It is definitely a must in every girl's cosmetic bag.  Word of caution however, this primer tends to dry eye lids a bit. So in the winter I always use eye cream before applying the primer.  And in the summer this base is absolutely indispensable.  In the sweltering heat my lids get really oily and without this magical primer I could say ""bye, bye"" to a decent eye makeup.Some say that it's a lot of money to spend for primer. However trust me this small tube will last a very long time. Very little of this stuff goes a long way.  I really just use tiny amount that I apply with the applicator on my lid and spread with the tip of my finger.  Granted this tube is not very convenient in terms of getting out every last drop.  However to remedy this all you need to do is watch a few videos on youtube that describe how to properly cut up the package and save every last drop of this amazing primer. 100% recommend this product!",5
"I bought this to combat dry skin that I've been plagued with the last 6 months. I have hormonal skin and it goes from oily to dry for no apparent reason. I'm normally super oily in the spring and summer but not so much this year, in fact my skin is dry and flakey. I've been using this about 2 weeks now about twice a week and I like it. I can't say that the moisture affect stays long term but I definitely see the difference the morning after. I was also concerned as a dark african american that it would have an adverse fading affect on my skin (which I do not want), but it did not. My skin is also super smooth and silky afterwards. I'm hoping with sustained use the moisture will last longer.",4
I am very pleased with the product. It does exactly what it claims to do!  Defines curls and amplifies them.,5
"this product is amazing, it is all natural and a MUST for my skin care routine, although it is listed for anti aging and for dry skin, I have combo oily with occasional breakouts and my skin is super sensitive , i use it before applying my moisturizer or zit cream, i will be ordering again soon, the seller is awesome, i got exactly what i ordered",5
"I do really like this lipstick, I think it is overpriced, though. I wanted to try the brand without paying the exorbitant shipping at the Lime Crime website. While I like it, it's not worth the money I spent on it, but that's okay.",5
"I've used Maybelline Mascara most of my life, but a friend recommended this product and I was happy to find it on the Vine list.  I've used it for several weeks now and I'm a convert.  The fine-bristled brush separates each lash for easy coating with the product.  I've gotten compliments for my lashes since I began using Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara.  It washes off easily and doesn't burn my eyes.",5
Feels fantastic on my eyes.  I can see a difference in eyes not looking as tired as they did before I started using this cream.,5

"I have been using this for about a month now...I purchased it on a whim after seeing it as a suggested item...I'm 31, I have normal, olive toned skin with sun damage and early signs of aging...that I'm dying to erase!!

"Considering the two peels per sticker that you have to do and how easily they tear at the cuticle line if you have to do any trimming/touching up there, these are a big headache in my book.  Granted, they have some funky patterns, but that's the only advantage I can see.  I used these several times thinking I'd be able to improve my speed and deftness, but it just didn't happen for me.",1
"I've used the Kiss My Face products before, but, when I saw the 'value size' and the price, I grabbed it.Then I read some of the reviews.  Dries hair?  I was very anxious because I color my hair because of the white (not grey!) growing in.  The color process that I use is excellent, bought here on Amazon.  It left my hair soft and silky, much better than a box color.However, I was terrified of using this shampoo.  I finally took the jump, and my hair is clean, soft, silky, thick, curly, manageable.  It's still a bit frizzy, which comes naturally with curly hair, but it's always had a tendency to be frizzy.  I use a small bit of coconut oil and smooth it over my hair.  No more frizzies.As to the need to use more because it doesn't lather, it's not supposed to lather like other shampoos.  The main ingredient that makes shampoo lather is sodium laurel sulfate, which is very drying, and it's almost impossible to get all the 'bubbles' rinsed from your hair.  I don't pump the shampoo into my hands; rather, I pump it directly on my scalp - a small one of each side, two for the top, three for the back.  I've found this is a much better way to get the shampoo to the scalp, where you need it.  I work that into my scalp, and I can feel the shampoo in my hair.  If you massage your scalp when you hair is went, it feels much differently than when you massage the shampoo into your scalp.  The shampoo will dissipate rather quickly, but it thoroughly cleans your entire hair.Everyone has different hair, and what works for one, may not work for someone else.  I tried a When shampoo, and it was awful for my hair.Any questions, feel free to ask.",5
I bought this dappen dish along with a short little nail brush - and the two together have me doing my own french tip manicures at home for a fraction of the price. You must use glass with pure acetone or you risk a melted puddle of plastic - acetone is STRONG stuff.,5
"Since I cannot tan naturally, and I also don't want the harmful effects of tanning, I am always looking for a great self-tanner.  Honestly, this has some major pros and cons.  Pros - it goes on incredibly easy using the provided glove.  It doesn't streak and I also loved how you can clearly see where you've applied it.  Cons - it doesn't last long.  And yes, I know all the things you are to avoid once you've applied it - no skin oil, no lotion that contains lanolin or oil.  After getting out of the shower, don't rub dry...etc., etc.  Even so, I feel like the color lasted only 24-48 hours.  Will I keep buying this - yes because I feel like the ease of application and the natural color I get outweighs the short staying power.  I will continue to seek out ways to keep this from fading so quickly.",3
"I bought this because I read Disney characters/ princesses uses this as a finishing spray. I was skeptical, but it works great. It has an refreshing mint smell and I don't notice any shine on my face in pictures of me using this. Highly recommend for anyone that will be outside in humid weather and doesn't want an oily face in pictures.",5
"I have been using leave-in products for many years now, instead of blow drying my hair to make it manageable, or straightening it.This is the absolute best of the bunch. I can go to sleep with my messy, moist hair, after I've spritzed it a little with this product, and wake up with gorgeous, shiny, silky smooth straight hair.This is absolutely amazing.",5
I don't know what else to say about it except that it does exactly what it claims to do. So cute and compact too. Love.,5
"This was my first adventure in chemical peels, after years and years of acne treatments.  I've been around the block in terms of acne treatment!  My skin was dull, flaky, and wrinkly.  I was very nervous to try this peel, and left it on for a few minutes.  There was no peeling or redness the next day, though my skin was slightly sensitive at first.  My skin texture improved immediately, and my pores look better.  There was no real improvement in number/frequency of breakouts, but my overall texture has improved.  I've since used it many times, once every five days or so.  The results get better after each use.  I also use oil free acne wash, a benzoil peroxide mask and moisturizers with sunscreen.  This is a great peel, don't be afraid!  I just used a cotton ball to put it on, no need for a fancy brush.",5
"Packaged nice , they even tape the top so to prevent it from coming open during shipping. Correct size,trust me this will last a very long time as when used you never need much. Use this along with your fav nail polish color to make for doing your acrylic nails.",5
"I have originally tried a sample of this product and it was amazing!!! So I went ahead and bought the full bottle (though it seems tiny! I hoped it would be bigger - But i know it will last a while)I hate putting anything on my face other than a bit of toner and moisturizer so I was a bit skeptical, but I was going out to an amusement park for the whole day and needed to cover up my face! Needless to say I was very surprised that it went on silky smooth and stayed on my face all day giving protection from the sun. My face did not get oily or red, like it does with any other sunscreen. so I was SOLD!!!Its important to mention too, that I'm very VERY fair skinned and I was concerned that the tint may be too dark, but it just gave me a little glow and looked great!",5
didnt get the blue bow so im kinda upset since the blue bow is the main reason i bought the sticks anyway the sticks r great and deserve 5stars,5
"A nice product, goes on even and smooth. Blends well with my other makeup. I don't use this brush, I have my own that I use for blush, I don't like the really short brushes.",4
this color was perfect for me..its nice and creamy and covers very well..you can barely see my dark circles I have under my eyes. I love this product and will be buying from them again!,5
I love this conditioner! I couldn't find it on the shelf and was very relieved to find it in Amazon. It smells like cake icing. It is the only conditioner that truly feels like it goes into my hair. I've used it for years.,5
"I am hooked on this stuff. Tried it first time via a sample pack at Sephora, and am now a committed fan. It gives my long, coarse hair just the right amount of extra moisture and sheen after washing, without weighing it down like heavy silicone serums. Lovely smell as well. It also sprays in a fine, easy to disperse mist, vs other hair oil products I have tried, which spray in a goopy stream. Would highly recommend.",5
"i just recently colored my hair red, so i cant wash my hair often. i was recommended this product and i am so glad she told me about it! i just shake it spray it style it and go. i love it. i saw other reviews saying they dont think this works, something about packaging? mine works just fine. every time i use it i get product. and my bottle is even slightly dented on the bottom. im ordering more of these as soon as i get paid!",5
I didn't find this to be as good as other products for my skin anyway. I may work for others.,3
I asked my boyfriend to try these and he liked the result and said it was comparable toNivea M-SC-1007 Sensitive Face Wash by Nivea for Men - 5 oz Face Wash.  It didn't make his skin break out and he tried both the hydrate and sensitive washes.,4
I didnt buy it for putting color in my hair i actually got it so i can moisturize my hair easier and it works amazingly its easy to use and no mess im soo happy with it i highly recomend it,5
"very tiny but pretty. probably wont order this again, but a great first timer starter or student would benefit. ;)",3
"This product works better than most drug store-type shampoos, but I think I'm spoiled with Alterna products. Would definitely use if I had to do without Alterna.",2
"I like to use SPF30 during the summer months and this moisturizer fits the bill.  It feels great under makeup, has no perfume-y odor, and is a great price point. It is no frills,but does the job!  For the winter months, I would suggest layering this with another moisturizer if you have dry skin.  Overall, great product and I haven't burned yet!",5
"I generally like Philosophy products, but this stuff is not worth it. It does feel great going on, and provides great moisturization under makeup or at night before bed. However, it smells so awful that I finally threw it away and went back to good old Cera Ve PM. Given how expensive this stuff is, one should not have to make such compromises. My husband wondered why I smelled weird. Yeah, its that bad.",2
I like how shiny it makes my nails look.  Even when you use it over nail art or make a tiny mistake it makes your nails look really shiny.  It was just what I wanted.,5
"I am allergic to tree nuts, coconuts and a lot of environmental stuff. Used this for a year and it made my eczema so bad it gave me new patches of it. I would itch constantly and never thought to look at this soap as the cause because I was like hey, this is olive oil! Wrong. It made my face look so skinny and my skin was always dry. It's like it sucked the moisture out of my body even though I would put tons of body lotion on my skin. I stopped using it early this year and switched to Cetaphil soap and my eczema healed up and I was looking lively again and not aneroxic. But I am allergic to coconuts, so I started to have asthma. So I go back to this olive oil soap, and immediately I started itching, and my throat started to close. Had to take the nebulizer and benadryl. I don't know what's in this soap that causing me these problems but I know I'm not allergic to olive oil, I eat olives and I am fine. Please Kiss My Face, do something about this. Make this more moisturizing so that people like me can have something to use. I currently now shower with water and a wash cloth. Also after recently shampooing my hair with this bar, my hair started to fall out. That is after the first time I shampooed with this bar. Weeks later, everytime I pull on my hair, I pull large amounts in my hand. Not a good shampoo for coily natural hair folks. ;(",1
"As far as a facial cleanser, it works as advertised. I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I had absolutely no problems using this product.As for the anti-aging gimic, other than exfoliating (which does make my skin look better), I don't think anyone should expect to see dramatic age-reducing results any time soon.This cleanser kind of reminds me of Noxema cream, but without the smell, which is nice.",4
My dermatologist recommended this.  It protects from the sun and helps combat acne.  I love how light weight it is.  I recommend it.,5
"The mask is refreshing and fun to peel off but I wouldn't say it'll do anything for your acne. If you're looking to clear out your pores, get a tough charcoal mask, if you're looking for something fun, get this.",3
"Amazoners suggested this stuff. I've been using it all over the world and so far no bad sunburns. It works through my activity, sweating, and other stuff.The one thing is that it's thick. Very thick. Otherwise all good.",4
"I really like this claw clip, especially because it is wingless.  I had a couple that broke, but I returned them and Amazon replaced them without any hassle. The look is lovely in my hair too.",5
"I've used Dream Matte Mousse foundation ever since it came out so I am a huge fan! I wish they had prime shipping for the actual foundation, but I will just use this one as that instead of concealer! I hope they never get rid of this product!",5
"Ordered this product because I wanted a shadow palette for stage makeup. I needed something bright I could pile on. The box came unopened, unbroken.The shadows are fairly pigmented, extremely blendable and very wearable. They were still vibrant after 8 hours dancing.This product, for me, was a great purchase. It arrived two days after my order was placed.",5
"I'm providing this review as a participant of the Salon Guys Market Research Program.  The shipment arrived on time and in good condition.In my opinion, this is not a good product to purchase.  The bristles are flimsy and do not easily pull through the hair.  The first use of the brush there was a lot of hair breakage that ended up in the brush.The packaging of the product is lacking in so many ways; the manufacturer name is not listed on the box, there are no instructions for use, and there is no verbiage as to the benefits of using this detangle brush.  What is apparent is the label on the bottom that simply says &#34;Made in China&#34; and those words became my focus, not the brush itself.No sale.",1
"Love it!  Great product. Just a small amount applied to face and neck each day as part of my daily skin care routine and I'm younger, brighter and more rested looking. I saw a difference as soon as first day of use. I recommended to several family members and friends. I recommend to you too!  Very fast shipping, professional seller. Great to buy from. Thanks!!",5
"I love that this cleanser smells nice and it works very well, just like Paula Begoun writes in her review of this product. It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned (it's hard to wash off). I don't even have to use eye makeup remover afterwards! My skin sort of normal but it can get dry. So after I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels a bit dry and I have to put some moisturizer on.....with Biore that I wrote review for before I didn't have to do that but Biore doesn't wash off my silly mascara very well :) choices choices. I think if you have skin on the oily side, this may work very well for you.Other than being a bit drying, it also takes a lot if this stuff to work. With some cleansers it takes 1 pump.....it takes 3-4 of this. Doesn't foam easily. I don't think I'd get this one again yet I'd give it 4 stars still.",4
Talk about getting something worth your buck!  I think this wins as a fantastic deep moisturizing conditioner.  I just got around using it for my wash week and let me say my hair feels amazingly soft and replenished like it's marketed.  It has great slip and detangling is a dream. And the frizz?  What frizz?  None!However since my hair is medium-thick in some areas I had to use more and now I'm out on the first time using it.  If they make a big one I'll probably go buy it because this really helps getting back to feeling and looking great.,5
I love all the colors that I ordered this is my signature color. My daughter is 4 and she is getting into wearing polish on her toes. These colors are perfect for her. There not too dark and they fit the both of us perfectly.,5
I like to use Argan Oil for my hair due to the frizz I get. It's very minor so I just need a little bit and rub it in my hands then run my hands through my hair. You can easily make your hair look oily so I would be very careful not to apply too much. There is a slight smell kind of like olive oil but it's not terrible. A quick spritz of a nice smelling hair spray or body mist will take that away. I think the huge size of the bottle for the price is amazing. A ton of companies have been putting Argan Oil in hair oils and body lotions. It's no surprise that this oil has many benefits to your body. I think getting the oil straight from the source is best because you cab just add it to your other favorite products if they don't contain it. I totally recommend this argan oil for your daily beauty regiment.,5
"Ordered this b/c wanted my lipsticks to be easier to pick out, had them in a cute leather bag b4 but always hated how I had to look thru so many b4 I found the one I wanted to use for the day. NOW, Im so happy I got this holder. LOVE IT! and have 4 extra slots left (guess I need to go shopping, lol) It looks great on my counter and it is well made, better than expected. Very happy with this purchase.",5
"I love this. It has the tropical smell and the tone enhancers. Lathers nicely, leaves my skin soft. I have noticed a slight evening of my skin tone, esp where no sun touches.great product",5
"I love fimo canes they are very easy to use once you get the hang of it, however there are too many images that i would not use, and i would have loved it to have a lot more bows, it only has a blue one",4
"This white creamy shampoo does not have much of a scent at all. It's more like the fragrance of a generic bar soap. It lathers well  and rinses fast. I experience something odd  when drying my hair. The towel seemed to glide over my head as if my hair was slippery. It doesn't feel slippery to the touch though.  After my hair dries it lays flat, which I like. It is very manageable and stays where it is combed. This is a good shampoo  to use when you want your hair to look it's best.",5
"Mata Hari is a wonderful pinkish shade that copliments my complexion much better than the fan favorite, Orgasm did. I have dark brown hair and eyes, and a medium-light complexion. I wanted to love Orgasm, but I didn't feel the peachy shade did anything for me. I was scared to try Mata Hari as it looked too bright in the photo, but in person, it is truly fantastic shade. NARS blushes are highly pigmented, so a little bit with the right application is all you need.",5
"I've had the brush for 2 weeks.  This is a product that does what it advertises.  I had a very big pore from an incredibly evil blackhead on my nose that is shrinking daily.  The bumps (not pimples exactly, just these little bumps I could never get rid of) on my chin are about 75% gone and what I have left is much smaller than before.  I've always taken good care of my skin so I didn't expect amazing results because I've always thought that the people that see radical changes didn't do much before they picked up whatever product they're raving about.I can say I've seen big improvements in the last 2 weeks.  I've used it for 10 days, twice a day and about 4 days only once in the evenings.  Make sure you let it charge fully before you use it.I use the sensitive brush and I haven't had any irritation to speak of.  It feels like I'm getting a facial every day.  Absorption of my moisturizer seems to have improved because I'm using less.I can't say enough about the brush.  Get it.7/30- UPDATE- I now use the brush once a day and have continued to see fantastic results.  My skin is very clear, soft, my pores are way smaller than they were.  I'm using a cleanser other than the clarisonic one and getting great results with it as well.  My niece has been using it too and has seen great improvement with her acne.  Clarisonic is a great product.",5
"This works really well. It is not time-consuming, it's easy, and it works sooo great. It leaves your hair really soft and silky and hydrated than it ever would be. It is a little pricey, but on Amazon it is way cheaper than in Target, and the product seems to be authentic.ONE THING. It smell so, so strong. Looking at the outside of this product, it seems so natural and mild. But the scent it so strong i can smell it even when the jar is closed... Now, I am a very sensitive girl when it comes to scents, but the smell is strong even for someone not as sensitive as I am.It smells like a lot of chemicals.. not natural at all, not fresh, and it's kind of weird. Totally unpleasant. It smells like it tried TOO hard to smell good and then failed.I'm so glad i bought 8.5 oz instead of 16 oz, because that would have been a lot of money wasted.I wanted to love this so much, but turns out that I don't.",3
Love this. Easy instructions. Easy to use for starters. Wonderful product. I am very please with it! Recommended for everyone who wants to start doing gel nails.,5
"""I have several of these pony tails from another company. Nice weight and length was a bit longer than shown but can always be trimmed. The color was too dark and ashy for my more light golden blonde hair. Not the sellers fault, but maybe this is not the way to purchase a hairpiece (unless you know the color will be a perfect match)""",4
has never been this soft until after using this produch with the conditioner. It's wonderful and it kind of makes my hair smell like donuts when I'm in the shower. lol love it!,5
I use this under my makeup or with no makeup at all.  It is creamy but not sticky or shiny.  It doesn't sting my eyes Just remember to shake before using especially the first time.,5
"The main difference between the Dove+ Anti Dandruff Fortifying shampoo & the Dove+ Fortifying Shampoo is the addition of the anti-dandruff ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) in the anti-dandruff shampoo.  This is a standard ingredient/strength added to dandruff shampoos.There are a few differences in inactive ingredients, but not a significant amount:Fortifying Only: contains Glycol Distearate, Tetrasodium EDTA, & Calcium Glycerophosphate while the anti-dandruff shampoo does not.Anti-Dandruff Only: contains Dimethiconol, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Butylene Glycol, & Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, while the fortifying shampoo does not.Both shampoos lathered well & rinsed out easily.  Male household members were not impressed with the so-called fortifying ability claims of either shampoo (they really saw no difference).  The male teenager did not like the fragrance and declared it an ""old man's"" shampoo.  The ""old man"" thought it was ok, but he isn't picky.  However, ""old man"" did say that he saw no difference in the ""fortifying"" ability of the two shampoos as compared to any other regular shampoo (he generally uses a Suave formula).So, shampoo is fine.  Not for teenagers because of the fragrance.  Good for anti-dandruff.",3
"Effective at removing moles.  Just be careful at placing product directly on growth mole, etc.  Will peel surrounding skin if not careful.",5
"I have fine hair but a lot of it and I punish it with blow drying and styling tools.  Clear Scalp Nourishing Mask has restored some of the softness and shine but hasn't weighed my hair down the way some other deep conditioners have done in the past.  My hair still had volume but the shine and softness was much improved after only three uses.  I really like the scent, too; not too strong but very pleasantly fresh.  The improved texture lasted through a few washes (I only use this once/week).",4
I was not using any special shampoos for my grey hair and noticed it was turning dull and yellowish brown and I found out about this shampoo. I purchased it and was tickled with the results. the hair that has already dulled has brightened a bit and the gray hair has turned into a bright silver. I am very tickled with this product used with the conditioner my hair feels very soft and is very manageable.,5
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream does a very fine job of moisturizing my skin.  It is easy to use, requires very little product to get results, but remained ""sticky"" feeling throughout the day.  Personally, I would use this more as a night moisturizer and use something different for daytime.",3
This mud makes my skin feel great. and It cost a lot less than going to the spa and saves me lots of money.,5
"I have slightly sensitive skin and Neutrogena T-Gel is awesome. I no longer get frustrating itching some while later on during the day.It is worth noting that you do need to make sure you thoroughly wash the shampoo out, and this can be tricky especially if the shower is weak, or you live in a hard water area. Make sure you spend a little longer rinsing!",5
"Great. Seems to be keeping my hair a nice color (not brassy), and I'm close to needing another highlight done (2 months).",5
"I have tested the Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray through the Vine Program.  This was an eight ounce bottle with a spray nozzle on top.  I wanted to try this as it said heat protected to protect my hair while playing golf in the heat of the summer.  I wear a visor while playing golf and thought this would help protect my hair.  It was suppose to shield the hair from damage of heat styling and add shine to your hair.  It said to use their shampoo and conditioner first but I did not have that product.  This was suppose to protect from all heat such as dryers, heat appliances, hot rollers and curling irons and designed to transform your hair with a smooth style that last for 48 hours.  This product is infused with keratine that leaves hair sleek and shiny.The directions said to spray liberally onto your damp hair then towel dry the hair and comb through.  I  found the nozzle was hard to use, it was hard to get the sprayer to work.  It also suggested to blow dry your hair while pointing the dryer downward to make the hair smooth.  This worked as I have straight hair and it is thick so drying the hair in this fashion made my hair smooth and straight.  I may have used too much of the spray solution as my hair looked dry by the end of the day.  I will be using this again when our summer weather gets here so see if it has the protection that it says it has.  Fairly easy to use once I managed to work the sprayer.Letta Meinen",3
these are just perfect your photo shoots and much more... want a professional look this is perfect! i got tons of there eye shadow and never had issues nothing beat Shany Cosmetics Perfect for your skin any type !,5
"My first baby was born in October 2012.  I used this every morning during my pregnancy.  It has a fresh scent and goes on easily.  I'm a very petite person and was scared to death of stretchmarks.  I know genetics play a big role, but I wasn't going to take any chances.  I also used Palmers every night after my bath.  I have NO stretchmarks:)  I am due with baby #2 this spring and I am following the same routine as last time.  I tell everyone about this little secret:)",5
"I have not given this item three stars because there is any defect in it, but because I had assumed it was a large shampoo comb. My disappointment came from the size of the package and even more disappointed once I removed this comb from the package. If you're expecting a large shower shampoo comb this is not what you're looking for. This seems to appear to be better suited for short hair or a young child's hair. Not suitable for thick curls as from the looks of it , it would not last very long. Again nothing wrong with the product itself, it's just not a large shower comb.",3
"This is one of the best colognes I have ever smelt, and the price can't be beat.  I read great reviews and blindly purchased this for my brother for Christmas.  When it came in, I had to open it up and have myself a good smell.  It's so fantastic!  It's not overly musky or pungent as some men colognes can be.  It's a very sexy, subtle scent.  I almost want to give this cologne to my boyfriend instead of my brother.  I will highly recommend this cologne to any man who wants to smell more than awesome.  I think I'll have to get some for my boyfriend later.  Christian Audigier is the best cologne I've ever smelt.  Love, love, love it!!!!!",5
i only used it once and stopped because it made my hair fall off like crazy. it doesnt smell too horrible and it comes off easily when you wash hair but it didn't suit me,1
This is a great matte top coat.  It creates a flawless finish to make any nail polish into a matte look.,5
"Yesterday my husband said to me, ""Honey, tonight you're goin' to get ""AXE'd""!""  And I chuckled and replied--because I knew exactly what he meant by that promise, ""Well, that's cool!""In all seriousness though, he had already cracked the lids on this AXE Chilled face wash, the Chilled shave gel, and the Chilled hydrating/after-shave gel and was looking forward to an exhilarating experience.  I was too:  This ""Chilled"" fragrance does not come across like a good many of the AXE fragrances. The ""Chilled"" is a major step away from the sweet and cloying smell of most of the other AXE products we had sampled in the past.  The fragrances each of us wear are important to both of us:  If either of us don't like a fragrance, it doesn't get worn.  We both agree:  ""Chilled"" is a keeper.  I think the fragrance will appeal to all age groups.  The refreshing and cooling effect will be great in the summertime, and I can just picture smiles and sighs of contentment using it on hot summer nights while preparing to head out for some fun.Regarding the face wash in particular:  My husband is not used to using a face wash:  Whatever bath gel is there on the shower shelf, that is what he would put on his face.  So, now, in getting this face gel for him, I've started something:  He says it feels so good and was so refreshing and his skin feels so nice that he wants to keep using it.  ""Can I use it every day?"", he asks me.  ""Well, sure you can!  Twice a day!  As often as you wash your face, you crazy guy!  Use this one up and I'll get you another one!""",5
"I am growing my eyebrows at the moment and this little jar makes it easier not to go crazy seeing all the mess going on while  waiting for them to grow and shape. It does look natural - I got the fair, but  think I should have went a shade up.  my hair and brows are medium blonde.",5
"I personally love body washes, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It has a fresh grapefruit scent that will make you feel very fresh and clean.  I will say that I think that is very comparable to more expensive body washes.  It lathers up well, and a little goes a long way.I would definitely try more of these Caress Body Washes.",5
"We recently moved into a home with a large, but angular tub. I love the tub, but while it was large enough for soaking, the nearly straight back made it not as much fun to lounge. At the same time, I have been disappointed over the years with air pillows, which seem to quickly spring leaks.So when I was offered the opportunity to receive a complimentary test model, I thought, ""why not?""It arrived yesterday, and I set it into the tub to test later. So I found it interesting that when I checked on my six year old granddaughter, she had it set up at her heighth and was lounging away. She declared it ""very comfortable."" later, when I had my bath, I adjusted it higher, and enjoyed a nice lounge, till the water cooled off.It is easy to adjust, easy to clean, and approved by both grandma and granddaughter.Edited -It is now more than a year later. Last week my granddaughter was being rough in the tub and managed to tear out one of the suction cups. What made me take notice was that even though the suction cup came out, the material did NOT tear and I was able to get it back in.To me, this is the sign of a well-made product that has already outlasted all of the blow up ones I have ever bought, still going strong.",5
"I need about 3 of these just for one eye.  I don't use a ton of mascara or eyeliner either.  This also burns and I need to make sure I am near the sink to wash my eyes after each swipe of the pad.  Even after a using 3 of these for one eye and coming out of the shower, I still look like a raccoon which means this didn't do a good job of taking off the eye make up.  Useless!",1
"I didn't find this to be particularly moisturizing or clean rinsing, which would seem to be the reasons Dove would like me to buy this product.  I don't care much for the odor, yes a personal preference.  I've purchased a few other Dove men's products at the closeout discontinued big lot store, and this doesn't seem to be any better than those, and those were about half the price.  I if wanted to buy more, I'd just wait for it to appear there.",3
Hard to get used to applying with a tube (messy) to false eyelashes and getting the proper timing between application to lashes and placing above eyelash so it stick quickly. Application might work with practice and more steady fingers BUT it would be less messy if not in a tube and instead applied with a brush.,3
"This stuff is AMAZING!! I am using it for my dry skin and it is awesome. The smell is heavenly , my skin looks beautiful and I am completely satisfied with this product. The very first time I put it on my legs , my husband took notice. So happy with this purchase. I need more more more!!!",5
"I have used the bottle of Foxbrim Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum for around two weeks now. I have been using other Vitamin C Serums for a short while and I am finding that Vitamin C serums are a go-to  face care product to incorporate into my daily routine.Foxbrim's serum is working like a charm to produce a glow to my face and the pores seem smaller and the skin tighter (that is a good thing). Let's just say, this is good stuff. I have enjoyed using it and can recommend it",5

"Love the price for this eyeshadow palate and the fact that you get 10 shades, however I did find that the pigmentation wasn't that great and there was quite a bit of fallout on my cheeks after application. I did use an eyelid primer and Mac's fix plus to make the colors brighter and that seemed to help. Not bad for a $10 palate but probably won't purchase again for myself or as a gift.",3
"This is an effective body wash that doesn't have an overpowering scent and leaves skin nice, smooth, and silky.  Most importantly, it doesn't leave my skin dry and itchy.  Nevertheless, everyone's skin reacts differently to different soaps and bodywashes. My family and I usually prefer organic soaps bought OTC at the local pharmacy but this bodywash worked alright and is worth a try.",4
"I am in love with this Shea butter , it is not sticky or oily . It goes on smooth and a little goes a long way . It smells so amazing and feels amazing on my body I use it as my daily moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling soft . I would recommend this shea butter . Thank you",5
"I bought this for highlighting powder and I am so happy with it's performance. Picks and holds powder well and with the tapered end you can get into smaller, direct areas, as well as wider areas of your face. Perfect for what I wanted, no loose brush hairs and I use it daily. I'm very happy with this!",4
"This set is not only great for travel,  I originally ordered this set to try out the four products it contains.  I was so impressed by the results that I later ordered the regular size of all four products.",5
My favorite is the chanel stamp it looks so classy and was easy and clear to stamp without a problem.,5
I ordered some earlier this year and I loved it. I was using on on my face and arms. It helped get rid of the bumps I get on my arms (keratosis pilaris) better than anything else. When I went to buy more I was being cheap and bought a different brand. That was a mistake. Didn't work at all. I am not back to using Watts Beauty and it works just like before! I am in love once again! No more cheapskate! I will only buy this brand from now on.,5
"I just started to try wearing false eyelashes. These took a LONG time to arrive. The eyelashes and glue arrived much quicker so I went to YouTube to learn how to apply. When these arrived I thought it would make the process of applying lashes somewhat easier. I thought wrong. When I tried to use these I ended up with black glue on my eyelids. I probably just need more practice. For me the applicator didn't just automatically make it easier to apply the lashes, yet.",3
"I am definitely not pregnant but figured this product would be good for my skin.  I like it okay, but not crazy about it.  It took much rubbing to get it into the skin.  I like the sunscreen part as I am in the sun quite a bit this time of the year.  It didn't make my skin feel any better and I don't think I would pay the price asked for it.  Just okay...nothing extra.",3
"I have used Fekkai Glossing products but stopped buying them due to their high cost and my lowered income.  When offered the Fekkai Full Blown Volume Shampoo 8 Fl Oz to try, I knew it was a good match for my hair.  Initially, I loved the scent and I still adore it.  Having thinning and fine hair, for best appearance, I benefit from a shampoo that is not weighty.  This shampoo is just what the doctor ordered and my haircut schedule will occur at longer intervals.  The shampoo is truly perfect for my hair.",4
"It works well for medium designs, but if you use the extra large plates, you will need a larger stamper.",4
I would definitely order this glue again.,5
I wanted the natural ones but i got white. Oh well it does the job and people allways compliment me on how my nails look once i finish designing them. So these work pretty well.,4
"I'm updating my review from before because months later I tried this again since I still had it in my cabinet.  Apparently, the first time I used this I didn't really need the keratin treatment part.  Now that I actually do, I find that yes, it does work.  However,  I do still feel like it dulls my hair highlight color job.  (I have my hair highlighted with color not the usual highlighting stuff that can be so damaging to my hair and turn it white since I'm a natural blonde.)  I use the shampoo, conditioner (this) and the leave in spray.  Maybe I'm over-doing it especially since this says it's a deep conditioner, but again, now that I really need it, I don't think the deep conditioning part is over-doing it. (Why do I suddenly need it?  Well, my usual hairdresser was not available last time, and though they swore up and down that the formula for highlighting my hair was the same, uh, I can attest that it was not.  Something damaging occurred as a result this time.  sigh)So, yes, I think this keratin alters my color to a certain extent, but the benefits of how it improves the quality and actual condition of my hair makes me continue to use this about every other hair wash.  (Though maybe all keratin treatment products would alter the hair color??? I just don't know.)So, my advice is to learn about what keratin does to hair and why and when it's really needed.  There's a big push for it these days.  If you really need it, this product would be worth a try.  However, not everybody really needs a keratin treatment.  Sometimes just a good conditioner and leave-in spray or finishing oil will do.Old review:  I used this and the shampoo with a little of the spray before drying.  It left my hair drier than before, and with a change to my recent color job.  Not drastic, but enough to notice since the color was just done a few days ago.  Dulled/ muted the color/highlights.  I like the original products though.  This keratin line is not for me.",4
"This product did wonder for my acne.I started getting acne again about 5 years ago and as an adult, this is really embarassing and I hatted it.I tried so many products and many just dried out but didn't really help.I first started using this product as a mask 2 times a week, just as suggested by the label.But since my skin is quite used to acid and retinols, I started experimenting using it every other night over my forehead, where I have most of my stuborn breakouts. I put on a very think layer and leave it in. The next morning my skin feels great. I have seen fewer white and black heads and definitely less pimples.Beside this product, I also use the Peter Thomas Roth acne gel.You do have to be careful of NOT over drying your skin, thus the proper moisterizing of your skin is super important.For that, I use the Vitaville argan oil, which has amazing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. A few drops on my hands, rub, and dab on the entire face. AFTER that I use this sulfur ointment and my skin does NOT get dried out.Once a week I also use a fruit peel, which helps to get rid of dead skin, which is important so that all the products really can penetrate into the skin and not just sit on the surface.Yes, this product smell, but hey, it has 10% sulfur in it, that's why it's effective for black heads and pimples. For that reason I only this this product at night time. Yes, the smell does linger a bit for more than 1 day. But what the heck, rather glowing skin and a bit smell then full face of pimples, which I used to have and it drove me crazy!",5
"Toni&Guy; was a new-to-me brand before I decided to try out the plumping whip. My hair is cut into an above-the-shoulders A-line, and its texture is baby fine, although I have quite a bit of hair. One of my biggest frustrations is never getting as much volume as I would like when it's just me styling my hair. I've tried powders, sprays, and other products that have a similar texture to Toni&Guy; plumping whip.The consistency of the plumping whip reminds me of cheap conditioners that I used to purchase from the grocery store before upgrading to Matrix (purchased from Ulta Beauty). Before adding in the plumping whip, I let my hair air dry for about fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit confusing as to how much product to use; they suggest a walnut-sized amount, but does that mean with the shell on or without? Trial and error with the plumping whip allows me to recommend that if you do try out this product for yourself that less is better. If you have a short hair style, then a dime size amount should work just fine. If you have longer hair, you may want to double or triple the dime size, depending on your length, texture, etc. The point is that you'll find out what works best for you after a couple of uses&#8212;but start out small and go from there.My hair took much longer to dry with the volume plumping whip, and felt sort of sticky to me once it was &#34;dry.&#34; Trying to straighten out my light, natural waves with a flat iron after using the plumping whip proved frustrating. I could not get the strands of hair shaped into my desired form, and the after effect was greasy looking, even though I'd just washed my hair.The mornings after using the plumping whip, my hair looks even worse, especially around the crown. I never want to leave the house&#8212;even for the gym&#8212;if my hair looks like it hasn't been washed in a few days. I also lose whatever shape I managed to do the day before the following morning.I gave Toni&Guy; a fair shot, but it's just not right for my hair type. Oh, and as far as volume goes? The plumping whip does nothing for me in that respect. It's a bit too heavy for my hair despite being lightweight itself, and makes my hair lay just as flat as it would without it, though possibly even flatter.",1
"Awesome price, nice sturdy product. I have average sized hands and fingers and there is more than enough room in the wells for them. I've been filling them with straight acetone to remove my gel manicures and they have held up perfectly; no discoloration or deterioration of the plastic. The curve is nice and is comfortable to keep your fingers in the wells for a long time without feeling cramped.",5
"This is a very nicely smelling and gentle shaving gel. It is very smooth and easy to apply. However, I was hoping that it would be thicker and cling to my face a bit more. Once I apply it to my face it feels more like a thin foam than a thick gel. It still gets the work done, but I don't think it's as efficient as some other proper gels that I've used. As for the hydrating part, I haven't noticed much of a difference between this gel and other ones that I've used that are supposedly not as hydrating.Overall, a good product that gets the job done, but I don't think it's anything special.",4
"I bought this after seeing several nail designs on Sephora using the matte/glossy combination.  This is easy to use and there are some great tutorials online, through Sephora and YouTube.  Check them out and you will find some very sophisticated designs that are demure for the office but still artistic.",5
Another great item from Insta Natural.  I really like how this argan oil soaks in and doesn't leave a greasy film!  It helps with frizziness and flyaways! If you have issues with those hair problems or just need a little extra conditioning to your hair this would be the product for you!,5
"I like Clean & Clear but I've never noticed any big changes from using this line. The cleanser is nice and tingly (a little, not much) and feels good but it's not anything terribly special. I have used it consistently only for a period of time and then stopped. I wanted to do the review and give it an honest rating and I'm afraid it didn't do what I was hoping it would do for me....",3
"I was waiting for the MASH plates to come back in-stock but it never did. I was thinking on just buying the Konad brand but really did not want to since they are $7 each. Right when I was going to place the order for Konad I came across these plates. It only had 1 review so I just placed it in my cart and waited to see other people feedback. Once it reached 3 (5*) reviews I placed the order. It took 6 days for the item to get to me. I did my Gelish gel nails last night and tried different designs from different plates. They all worked and came out great. Most of the plates are the same designs as the Konad brand. Ones that I was about to purchase for $7 each. I am so glad I waited. I did also purchase the Konad double sided stamper. I have a knock off stamper and does not perform as well as the Konad, its a must have. Also, I used regular nail polish for the plate designs. I actually tried two different brands and both worked great.",5
I have been buying Elta MD products for a while now; they are the ONLY ONES that dont leave my skin feeling greasy or oily; i can put my makup on right after using it;  it is not sticky at all and it offers great protection;  Love it.,5
"Cheaper at corner drug store by a couple of bucks, but that is my problem.I actually am not that thrilled with the product.  It doesn't seem to do anything.  The other similar products that I've used work much better/faster so that there is a noticeable difference after a week or so of use.  This doesn't seem to do anything.  It does get bonus points for smelling pretty good though and it is cheaper than the products that worked for me.  Would not buy again.",2
This thing doesn't work at all. It doesn't hold my hair tight enough. It just falls out. And I have very thick hair.,1
This eyeliner doesn't smear! It is waterproof too. It is easy to apply...it has a nice fine tip. No complaints.,5
I thought they would be a more dense sponge but they are not. They are very thinh and not very dense at all. The work ok. Just not what I expected.,3
"I ordered the 5 set dotting pens and the Metal alloy heart nail designs and realized later that they shorted my order , only the dotters came , I ordered so much stuff and it all came @ once and overlooked  the shortage,then waited for it and the nail designs never arrived ..will keep you posted on how that was handled",1
i love my false lashes but i hated doing them with tweezers. this product is great and very help ful,5
"This works, but if I stop using it my bacne comes back again =/It smells great and if you keep using it, it actually will work!",4
"I've been using Jergens Natural Glow tanning lotion off and on for the last few years. I love the versatility of it. If I know I have an event coming up or am going to be wearing my swimsuit for something I plan to start using my lotion a few days ahead of time so I have a nice, subtle tan by the time I want it. With one application I may have a very slight tan, but with 2+ days of application it's much more noticeable. I also apply it twice a day if I'm trying hard to get a tan. I used to go to tanning beds when I was in my late teens, early 20's, but now I worry about the long term health effects, so this is my substitution. I've also done some airbrush spray tanning, which I think is awesome, it gives a very nice, heavier tan, but is much uglier when it comes off and is much more expensive. It's uneven and splotchy after 5-7 days, wearing off pretty fast in higher friction areas (inner thighs, in between breasts, ect). So that makes me prefer the Jergens for the majority of my tanning needs. Here's a few bullets on what I like and don't like about this lotion:The good:-Effective: It works well and the color looks natural, not orange or fake.-Usually no lines or uneven spots: This is the advantage to using a lotion that just tans a little bit with each application.  If you miss a spot one time or do it uneven, it isn't obvious  at all and usually the next time around you'll cover that spot and everything will look great.-Safe: I haven't read any studies or any literature that questions  the safety of products such as this. That is a huge bonus to me!-Inexpensive: at $7-8 a bottle this is much cheaper than spray tanning. One bottle lasts me roughly 15 applications over my whole body (totally an estimate, I've never counted).The bad:-Odor: It has a very obvious tanning smell to it. Every tanning product I've used (even the spray tan) has this type of odor to it. I'm guessing it's vey hard to make a lotion that doesn't or else someone would have by now. It's just one of those things that you have to accept when you use it. It's not as bad of an odor as some other brands I've tried, especially the store brands.-Careful with your whites: I have white sheets and now am stuck with a darker, tan area where I sleep and my arms and legs rub against the sheets.-Progressive aspect: You can't really pick this up at the store and hope that within a few hours you'll have sun kissed skin. Plan ahead or get spray tanned.Overall, I don't hesitate to recommend this method of tanning to people who enjoy bronzed skin, but don't want the long term health effects that come along with tanning booths. I've been  enjoying this lotion for a few years and definitely plan on continuing using it.",5
You are basically paying a dollar a brush!! All these brushes work perfectly. It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality! It works great when apply your makeup.,4
"Love this and will reccomend. The first thing I noticed was how good it smells, like a grapefruit,citrus.My skin was much softer and the tone was ""sunkissed"" like the bottle says. There isnt streaking.Its nice if your keeping a tan or want a boost without a deeper tan. I use this almost daily and on occasion I use banana boat and use this to extend it. Great stuff,I'd look for a sale.",5
"This is a nice large bottle of Glycolic face wash. I love the pump dispenser, I keep it in my shower with my Clarisonic brush. The brush pushes the Glycolic deeper into the skin. I had a few black heads I was fighting and they are gone. My skin is clearer and brighter.",5
"Like every Axe product for men I have experienced - and how many products that involve self-care for men are actually out there? - this one is exactly what I have come to expect: well-performing, a tad overly-fragranced, and definitely reasonably priced. Ideal for an evening in an Eastern-European nightclub!",3
Product works great!  After about 2-3 weeks I started to get compliments from everybody!  I love it!  It is worth the money spent!,5
"I initially purchased this to use on my 8 year old daughter's hair.  Her hair is extremely long (goes to the waistband of her pants), and I wanted something that I could quickly use in the morning and have her hair be wavy, as hot rolling or using one of the many curling irons we have ends up taking too long and frustrating both her and me while doing her hair.  Her hair is soft and fine, but she has a LOT of hair.  Her hair is naturally wavy, but with the weight and length of her hair, the waves don't come out and stay unless it's really humid.It took about the same amount of time as it does when I use my Chi on her, the result was beautiful waves that stayed pretty well in her hair without using any hair product to keep it wavy.  It earns an A+ for her hair.I have shoulder length hair with a fair amount of natural curl that I normally blow dry and straighten because it mainly only curls on the bottom of my hair, resulting in a hairstyle that looks like it's been hot rolled.  It's pretty, but it gets boring to me to have the same style all the time.  My hair, like my daughter's, is soft and fine, but it's not as thick as her hair.  I decided to try this on my hair to see how it would do, and I LOVE it.  It takes the same amount of time as it would for me to use my Chi, but LESS time for styling it, and it looks fabulous.  I use hairspray after I ""fix"" it, and it stays the way I fixed it until I brush or wash it.  I've also brushed it and re-sprayed it and had nearly the same hair style, just with a little more ""floof"" to it.Drawbacks?  None.  It heats up fast, does a great job, and when I'm finished with it, I turn it off and slide it into my Vera Bradley curling iron cover.",5
easy to apply looks good on  stays on all day has a ice mat finish and I over all like this product,4
"Tried this on a whim, love the light scent, spray lightly though if you have fine hair and spray the recommended distance from your hair. I sprayed it too close and it made my hair slightly oily, not the product's fault, it was my error in application. It does give a really nice golden sheen, and I mean a true golden sheen, like there is really gold in your hair, not just a colorless gloss. The seller also shipped super fast, I had my product within days.",5
"I've been using this for a long time. My normal M/O is to apply it later in the afternoon when I'm losing my morning-fresh makeup look and need just what the product implies: a lift! It's feels cool and nice to apply. Just dab a few spots under your eyes (where dark circles may live) and then ""pat"" the product until it blends in. This definitely perks up your look. I always order a new tube before I run out, wouldn't want to be without.",5
This product is very nice and and easy to use. The product I purchased was very pretty and I would recommend this product to my friends because of the cheap prices and on time shipping.,5
"While I like the smell the leave in can tend to leave your hair with a slightly greasy look. Overall not a terrible product, but not sure I would purchase it again.",4
"I have been using this product as instructed for between three and four weeks. So far, no new hair, but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer. On the plus side, I've experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes, dyes and topical medications. It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply.",4
"This smells like a coconut & pineapple drink. If you like that, you will like this. Its an awkward bottle to put in the shower though. It is a nice smell for a bubble bath too. I'm not sure if it actually extends your tan as a body wash, but it doesn't hurt it.",5
"it's really strong. I really enjoyed using it, but i'm starting to not like the idea of how the roller ball is in contact with so many pimples.I'm going to start using tea tree with qtips after this.",5
"Bought this for our virgin island vacation and it felt nice, was moisturing as an after sun lotion but I wasn't craztpy about the fragrance. It is kind of tropical but I tend to prefer the Hawaiian tropic sunscreen fragrance- this one is overly pungent sweet.",3
"As far as the pricing, I really can't complain, because the similar brush case by itself is sold for $40 on Amazon, so for $25, I got the nice purple case with all the brushes.Whats good about it:37 nail brushes, (which you can use some for the eyeliner gel or lips too ), brush qualities are good, the kolinsky brushes are the best, I wasn't expecting to have those in the box, since their picture wasn't on the website. I don't know how to use these brushes, since I have no idea about them, I do DIY nails at home for myself and my sisters, but I never thought you can have 37 brushes. 5 of them of course are for marbleizing, which are obvious to separate, but the rest are not as easy. Now my possibilities are endless. Since I don't know what their uses, so I just pick them based on their size and brush angel. For the design I'm using all the smalls ones, and for polishing I use the big ones, I know its pretty obvious but, there isn't any other way to figure this out, I also searched yotube and found out about some, but there are some crazy style brushes in here that I really need to ask a nail technician.Whats not good:The brushes are Black, and the case is purple, it would have been better if both were same colors. I know its not a big deal, but the company says in back of the box, please submit any useful feedback which can help you use our product easier. So this is why, I want to mention even smallest problems. The case came with no extra box, it was just a case with shrink wrap, I have more expectation from this brand now, I spend half of my bonus check on them, and I'm thrilled with their quality and service and variety of products, but now I expect a better packaging, all the items I bought from them came ina  color box, (which is perfect when you give these as a gift) except this brush set, which came in a  blank box, and wrapped. The logo and item # was on the box and everything, but no color box.",5
"This lipstick is great with applying, its very moisturizing. Only reason it was not five stars is because it came off extremely fast. Within 3 hours most of the color was gone and that was without eating. But the color is amazing!",4
When I ordered this product I thought I would be using it all the time. Since I got it I have used it only twice. There is not enough spots to hold brushes and the spots are too wide and either too shallow or too long. Not a good product at all,2
I suffer from a mild eczema problem on hands and chest.  These products have helped clear up my skin and its better than I've seen in years.  Very grateful.,5
"The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series 1 Inch Touch Control Digital Straightener works considerably well considering the price range. The features that are appealing are many! One that I certainly appreciate is that the cord swivels preventing all those unwanted kinks of a cord wrapping up on itself when you are trying to style your hair. There's almost nothing more annoying than that, let me tell you! There is no off and on switch, the straightener is on as soon as you plug it in. Considering I can be scatterbrained on occasion, a feature that is highly favored to me is  the auto off after use! I'm certain this particular feature will ease the minds of many wondering if they've left their straighter plugged in. You & I can worry no more with this one!The digital aspect is pretty neat. You simply slide your finger up and down a scale to set the the heat temperature that you desire. There's no numbers so you'll kind of need to figure out your preference on your own though do note that the highest temperature is 400 F. After I found what worked best for my hair, I used the the locking feature to keep my preferred preferences and it remembers them for later use too! My hair is long, thick, and wavy and I found this straighter to work well on my hair. It gets hot quickly so I am able to style and be on my way in a matter of a few minutes!I will note that I did pinch myself a couple of time while using it. Mainly I was holding the straighter a bit low and pinched my hand on the lower area where you would squeeze the straightener to glide down the hair to flatten. I haven't bumped or unlocked the digital heating settings that I put in at all when using. I wanted to make sure to mention this comes in one of those pain to open plastic packages and there's no storage pouch to put the straightner in when not in use. There is however a 2 year warranty to be happy about!",4
"Just what I was looking for, I love it. On this spray bottle they have where you can adjust how you want your product to spray out the bottle (I love that) Overall great product! I recommend this!",5
"I have dry hands, cuticles, and nails. I purchased this product along with the Essie cuticle oil. I put this top coat on and my nails haven't split and actually feel stronger. Not to mention, the shine is still in tact, even after a week of wear!",5
"The only negative thing I have to say is that the color is different to what is pictured on the product listing. The color is actually more pink than purple (although you can definitely see the purple in the color). In the picture, the color looks like a deep purple, whereas in person the color is more of a deep pink, as one reviewer already mentioned. It's almost like a dark Barbie pink. I almost took a star off for this, but that is more of an issue with the product listing than the actual product. The actual color is a beautiful color, but I wanted the deep purple color in the picture.EDIT: Since posting this review, I have become unhappy with the quality of this polish. This polish is below average in that arena. It dries very, very quickly (10-15 mins) and leaves a nice, smooth finish, but it chips very easily, which I did not expect from a well-known brand like OPI. This polish starts chipping badly the day after application if no top or base coat is used. I have never experienced this with any of the other polishes I have used, even with cheaper polishes that you can purchase from stores like CVS. Even though I typically apply a top and base coat, which would make the polish last longer, I don't like that a bottle of polish for which I paid nearly $6 chips so badly the day after application that it looks like I've been wearing it for two weeks. I will not be purchasing this brand again simply because I can buy polish for cheaper than $6 of equal or better quality - at least as it relates to the chipping issue. I would advise using a very good top coat if you do decide to purchase this polish.",2
"I have fine hair that's been fairly fried by coloring and blow drying. I heard that Macadamia oil might help my hair, and it has. I've been a 100% Macadamia oil product for several months, but it is quite expensive. So I thought I'd try this product, which contains macadamia oil as well as other ingredients. I don't follow the directions (which talk about separating hair into sections)--I just spray it all over after washing my hair and then comb it through. I don't think my hair feels quite as healthy as when I was using the 100% oil product, but for the price, this works very well.",4
"OK, I was a Ped-Egg promoter.  A user for over five years, I told everyone I knew about how wonderful the Ped Egg was.The last time I bought replacement blades I thought they were a little dull but found one that worked for a while. It got to the point I would get a rough scrap with the blade and went looking for replacement blades.  I read the all the reviews about dull replacement blades and then the reviews on the Revlon Pedi-Expert.I figured since the price was about the same I'd give it a try.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  I will never go back.  I did not even need to sand and buff after using the Pedi-Expert.  My heels the side of my feet are so smooth and free of loose dry skin a condition I never recall while using the Ped-Egg.  Compared to the Pedi-Expert using the Ped-Egg is like using a woodworkers rasp.I never thought I'd give it up, but I find myself saying good-bye to my Peg-Egg.Love the Revlon AND you get a very good pair of clippers and a nail file!BONUS",5
This stuff must be real coconut because everytime i want to use it i cant get any out the bottle until i boil water and let it sit in the pot or i put it in my laila soft bonnet dryer so that it will soften up. i only been using it a few weeks now so if i see any significant hair growth or change i will update my review. It does smell great though!,4
My kids love the smell of this conditioner but after using it for a couple of months their hairdresser said their hair was very dry.  Now we alternate between this an another shampoo.  The price is great for the quantity...especially on subscribe and save.,3
"Great product, tingles on your face when you use it and it doesn't take much to cover your face so it is a great deal as well.",5
This primer is nothing more than vinegar in a bottle.  it has the strongest vinegar smell and my acrylic started to lift the next day!  It was honestly better when I didn't use a primer at all!  It was cheap but defiantly DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  The only reason it gets one star is because the shipping was extremely fast.,1
My wife has been using this product for awhile and it does a great job of cleaning the hair. It feels really good after using it. It seems to work about the same as other moderate level shampoos.  It is not salon quality but it is not the cheapest either. It does have a good scent. I couldn't really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil. So if you are looking for a moderate priced shampoo that works you may try this one as Suave put out a decent product as usual with this one.,4
"This gel didn't keep my sons hair styled for long, and yet if I used more product, it left gummy white flakes that were visible in his hair. I'm a second-grade teacher and I see kids hair all day long who use gels like this. I'm always seeing little white specks that trigger a second look to be sure it isn't lice.Short-lasting hold + potential for white flakes + strong smell = doesn't work for us.",2
"meh.... used it religiously for a month (brushing my hair every night for 10 minutes, weekly facials. meh... you go further with buying hyaluronic acid for $12, and ditching the machine.",3
"I love this product, the color is amazing. The application brush works great and is a wonderful addition to the shadow. I plan on buying more eyeshadow from this seller in the future. I highly recommend this item and this seller.",5
"This Gelish Basix kit is a must for those who are starting out with gel nails.  It has everything we need to get started minus the gel polish in the color of our choice and the UV machine to cure it.Included are the following:* pH Bond* Foundation* Top It Off* Nail Surface Cleanse* Nourish* Artificial Nail RemoverThe bottles are very small.  Two of them are opaque, so I don't know how much I have left after doing my nails twice.  I think I have enough of each left for at least one or two more nail applications and then I may need to start replacing as needed.Instructions are on the bottle and the box, but the font is so small, it's very difficult to read.  I don't know if I do everything by the book, but here is what I do and it works for me:1) pH Bond -- 2 minutes UV light2) Foundation -- 2 minutes UV light3) gel color of your choice -- 2 minutes UV light (repeat for total of 3 coats)4) Top It Off -- 3 minutes UV light5) wipe off with Nail Surface Cleanse -- no UV light6) Nourish the cuticles and surrounding skin -- no UV lightTips: Apply everything in thin coats, and don't get polish on your cuticles or it will lift and peel.Voila.Use the artificial nail remover to remove the polish when done.  I recommend a very absorbent cotton, like the type used in disposable powder puffs.  Cut them down to size, soak them in the artificial nail remover, put them on the nails and wrap with foil.  In a few minutes, you will see it start to crackle.  At that point, the polish is easy to remove.This kit is very complete.  I'm glad I bought it and not each and every bottle individually.  It's easy to use.  Just wish the instructions were easier to read.",4
"My daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and she loves it, and it seems to be doing a great job on her skin, but I have no idea if it's really any better than one of the $30 ones.  That said, it's attractive, sits in the shower, and is getting used twice a day because she loves it so much, so I guess maybe it is worth it!",4
These holder are great they come in a set of two and I use a lot of OPI polish and don't have a problem fitting these in like some reviewers mentioned .What I really like is these keep my polishes from tipping over I would say these would fit just about any polish out there except for Butter London polish being square shape. would recommend these .,5
"Absolutely the best eye cream on the market!!! You have to try it to believe it... I know it may not work for all but it is amazing to me!!! You will not be disappointed!!! I know that the sellers might have said it would last a year but that is only if you use it once a week....Once you try it, you will be using it daily.....",5
Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner - for Dry or Damaged Hair - for Men and women this product has such a awesome pretty smell.  I used it tonight and my hair was soft and shiny. I would say this company get a A++++ from me they ship very fast and if you have any questions they are fast to answer  them.  Thank you for giving me the chance to review.,5
"About two years ago during a pregnancy, I started dealing with very dry skin. I tried product after product and asked two doctors about it. They gave me random samples but nothing seemed to hydrate my skin. FINALLY I have found a system that works! I love it!! I have always loved the Burt's Bees line and this just adds to the list of things that I love!! My fine lines are plumped up and less noticeable and the flakes are almost non-existent now.Immediately I fell in love with the cleanser. The smell woke up my senses and it went on very smoothly. I like that it is rich and hydrating, yet washes off cleanly without a greasy film.I would recommend using the whole system together to combat dryness.I was given this product as a gift through BzzAgent and was asked to share my honest & unbiased opinion.",5
"I found all three recommended ways to use it worked.1. On damp hair, then dried with a hair dryer2. On dry hair, then brushed3. On ends to make them less frizzyYou only need a little spray, unless you want a greasy look to your hair. It can be used instead of serum to keep hair from flying away and getting frizzy. It says it lasts for 48 hours and I verified that not only was my hair still shiny after that time, but the fragrance was evident.It's difficult to described the Fragrance - but it's foodie rather than flowery, smelling a bit like a cinnamon bun or pumpkin pie with fruity overtones. The smell is quite strong. I prefer flowery, strong French perfumes to fruity smells, however it's not unpleasant. I suspect if you had a strong perfume or deodorant that it might clash with the scent - so for some people an unscented version might be nice. As I get used to the smell it seems more pleasant. Sniff a sample if you can before you buy if you don't like strong smells.  So I'll give it a 4 instead of a 5 for the smell.The first four ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane (a silicone to stop the hair breaking), dimethicone (also known as polydimethylsiloxane, a silicone oil that makes hair slippery), lauryl alcohol (an emollient to smooth and soothe) and Fragrance.  The 5 exotic oils are from argan (a desert plant from Morocco),  safflower, olive, sesame and jojoba plants or seeds. A final ingredient is panthenol that binds to hair and seals it.The liquid is a slightly orange-tinged, clear oil. It feels gentle on the skin. My hair tends to frizz and fly away, so I like the Keragloss Oil as it tames my mane.",4
Great for cream and liquid foundation. Watched the video to make sure I used it correctly. Feelsgood on myface. I havevery sensitiveskin.,5
"I just did an extensive bathroom remodel so considered hardwiring a lighted magnifying mirror into the wall by my make up table. In fact I bought one and returned it because I didn't like the limitations on moving it up, down or to other locations & if I changed vanity stools the height might be wrong.  After much searching I decided to spend the money for this one and I love it!  5x is a good power for me and the light is excellent. I did not realize that it can be raised until I read the Q&A on this site so that will make it all the better.  My only wish is that it had a non-magnified mirror on the other side because it means having an extra hand mirror if you want to check the back of your head but this mirror is so great for make up, tweezing etc. that it is worth it. The best deal I know a lot of is at Bed Bath & Beyond because you can use a 20% off coupon.",5
"Great and easy to use curling iron.  My only complaint, and its a small one, is that there are no other temperature settings.  Otherwise, it is a great and efficient product.  It curls instantly and thank goodness for the glove it comes with.  You won't be disappointed.",4
"I've known this mascara forever and it never disappointed me. The lasting is really great, the lashes gain an excellent shape e dark color. My friends even think i'm wearing fake lashes.",5
"This is my favorite shampoo of all time.  It's the Rolls Royce of hair products in my opinion.  Leaves hair soft and shiny without extra weight and it smells INCREDIBLE.  Love this line and more importantly, addicted to this shampoo and conditioner ... until they come out with something better.  (I doubt that's possible!)",5
Loved for the price,5
"My wife and oldest daughter (14) have Clarisonics and the Olay system and love them (Clarisonic more than the Olay).  Our youngest (7) wanted her own. That's where the Revlon worked for us.First off, anyone purchasing this understands, simply by the price, they are not getting a high-end Clarisonic.  So, if your expectations are reasonable, I do not think you will be too dissapointed.  The product was fairly easy to remove from packasing and comes with batteries and sufficicent documentation.  Revlon also provides a good selection of attachments and a storage case, which worked very well for our youngest.The product build leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.  The build quality is less than OK in my opinion and the product uses very thin plastic.  Also, the unit is not water proof and does not even seem water resistant and thus should not be used in bath or shower.  While it clearly replicates the ergonomic design of the Clarisonic, on a MUCH smaller scale, we found the unit underpowered for adult use.  However, it was not underpowered for our 7 year old. Also, due to the much smaller size and weight comparfed to the Clarisonic, our youngest is able to hold it easily and she uses it frequently.Arguably, this product should be marketed for use by children. There are better options out there for adults in the same price range such as the Olay system (less attachments though).  Though I normally hate to bring price into a review, I believe at $25, the price is simply too high for what you are getting in contrast to other products.",3
I like this flat iron its sturdy and comes with a sample light weight oil and has the ability to dial up or down the temp. Gives great shine and it lasts for days.,5
"This stuff is amazing. I put it on before bed and after waking up, and it leaves my skin so moisterized! I have trouble with dry patches and after using this even those are gone. Its excellent under makeup, and doesnt make my skin oily. New favorite lotion!",5
My first time using these and they work like a charm. You have to be patient and careful when taking them out. I used the biggest one to give myself an updo for a ball I went to and everyone thought I went to the salon to get my hair done :),5
"I can't count all the ways I love this L'Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System Cleansing Conditioner!!!  I'd been struggling with the way shampoos continually left my hair like straw, no matter what type of conditioner I used after I shampooed--I was really becoming desperate, since I had been trying to let my hair grow down passed my shoulders, yet the terrible condition of the ends kept me continually trimming them off, due to dryness--I'd tried lots of popular brands of shampoo, too, including one I thought was 'the bomb', it was so popular--but, it was no better than any of the other shampoos I'd ever tried over the years--I was completely disappointed in them ALL!----when I first spotted this product here on Amazon.com, I read through all the reviews I could, and I was surprised at what others had to say about these types of non-shampoo conditioners!--I wondered if it would actually help my poor hair, so that I didn't need to resort to cutting it short in self-defense!--but, it not containing ANY shampoo made me cringe, because I couldn't understand how it could not only condition my hair, but also clean it!--but, out of desperation, I decided to trust those who'd raved about it, and I bought two bottles of it, plus a L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner to go along with it, just in case my hair still needed it----now, I can safely say that I have never been more pleased with any hair cleaning product I've ever used in my entire life!--and, this cleans exactly as they say it will, too!--I've also been using the L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner after I've rinsed out the Cleansing Conditioner, but I'm now finding that I can use less and less of the leave-in conditioner, since the Cleansing Conditioner is doing such a superior job at cleaning, and softening my hair all by itself!--not to mention the increased body it's given my now-thinning hair thanks to my advancing age[I'm 64]--to me, it's been such a blessing to have found this L'Oreal Cleansing Conditioner, and I can't recommend it highly enough.",5
"I tried these strips for the first time last week and they are pretty brilliant. Very easy to use/apply. What people may not know is these are NOT stickers. They are essentially pre pressed nail polished that's sealed. So when you put the strip on, it's really nail polish. It moves and molds and stretches. I love the concept and the styles but what I DO NOT love is the smell. You know how nail polish smells? Well these strips smell just like that. But forever. The smell NEVER goes away. I did my nails 6 days ago and I can smell the nail polish fumes alms it as fresh as the first application. And I smell it all day. I wash my hands often and that doesn't help. Next they do not last as long as the box/package says. I kinda expected that though. Like how nail polish will say chip free? Yeah, no. Lol. Currently as a stay at home mom not doing any dirty hands in work like a mechanic it something, I have 4 of 10 nails in tack. I'm going to give these another try because the designs blow regular nail polish out the water. And for a special event, this are super affordable and quick.",3
"I just use this product on my hair cause today is my hair day. And I did a pre-poo and use the shampoo and it left my hair a little hard I didn't like it. Even with the pre-poo my hair wasn't loving it. Usually My jhair response good with a sulfate free shampoo but with this one it hated it. I'm going to give it to my mother too see how is works for her. I will not repurchase this product.Will I recommend this to anyone no, but I think you should make your own mind up. Because it didn't work for me, it may work for you.",1
I have spent a small fortune on detangling brushes over the years.  Between my long hair and my daughter's long hair - we definitely have a need.  My daughter is the priority - brushing a little girl's hair is always a struggle.  Their scalps are so sensitive and snarls are quite problematic.  I was skeptical when I opened this brush because the bristles are very flexible - not the usual stiff bristles we have on other detangling brushes.  But I can tell you it works perfectly.  We mostly use it directly out of the shower and that is definitely where this brush shines.  No matter what it effortlessly glides through my daughter's hair.,5
"Like most women, I want to have smooth legs.  Also like most women, I hate shaving every day.  Getting a super close shave is important to me, and I hoped these razors would not disappoint.  One of the touted benefits to this razor is the built in lubrication.  Yes, there is lubrication, lots of it.  I shaved my right leg with shaving gel, and my leg felt very ""slick"" afterward, and I had to rinse my leg at least twice after shaving to get the ""slick"" feeling off. Once I realized how much lubrication was in the razor, I shaved my left leg without any shaving cream, and the results were still good.  As for the excess lubrication, I wouldn't consider this a major issue for me, because I was still in the shower, and it was no big deal to rub/rinse my legs off.  I can see where a guy may have a problem with the extra ""slick"" feeling on his face.I have used this razor every other day for two weeks, and the blades are still as sharp as ever.  I do take the added step of drying off the blades after every use, which helps keep them sharper longer.  The lubrication is still present, but not as abundant as when the razor was brand new.  The only complaint I have is that the top part of the razor, (the part that flips back to expose the ""trimmer"" part) will sometimes flip back while I am using it.  This inconvenience hasn't caused me to cut myself, but it is annoying, so I deducted a star.  My husband has used one of the other razors from the pack and he reports the same thing.Overall, so far this has been a quality razor that gives me the extra close shave I am looking for.  I will buy more of these in the future.",4
I like the serum and it does help to make my face more youthfull!,5
"Love this wash!  Does a great job preventing future breakouts and treating current ones.  I use it daily and the results have been outstanding!  If you suffer from body breakouts, you definitely need to purchase this product!!!",5
This works well - leaves my hair feeling clean and without a lot of build up.  I'm not sure how much it works on split ends - that mostly comes from the conditioner. But I've found that these Suave products really work best when paired up correctly.  The scent is nicea nd not overpowering.,4
"I've got somewhat thick, curly Caucasian hair -- and I am always on the lookout for hair products to keep the frizz and flyways in check.  I thought this was so-so.  Honestly, I prefer conditioner that is a little little thicker, richer, heavier than this.  I don't think it has the conditioning power of a hot oil treatment, for example.  It certainly didn't leave my hair greasy, but it didn't really keep it as controlled as I would have liked.  After using it as a rinse-out conditioner a couple times, I tried rubbing a bit of the conditioner into my dry hair before styling -- I thought it was more effective that way, and it preserved the wonderful, baby powder scent.This was okay, but I doubt I will use again, as I don't think it's heavy-duty enough for my thick hair.",3
"I have dyed my hair for years and am always trying different shampoos. My hair is straight and on the fine side and I wash it every day. I liked this shampoo. It lathers well (even in our hard water) and left my hair feeling nice. I didn't need any conditioner and it didn't dry out my hair or weigh it down.I think it has a strong scent - not totally unpleasant, but if you're sensitive to scents, it may bother you.I do wish Amazon didn't ship this in a padded envelope. Somehow the shampoo bottle opened and while the bottle was wrapped in plastic, I lost about 1/3 of the shampoo. Shipping this in a box would have prevented this problem.",4
I really like this wig. It is on the smaller side and so it looks a little shorter on me than in the picture. It's not falling apart and the base of the wig is nice and snug with an adjustable elastic strap. It also includes a cap to wear underneath. The color is slightly brighter than the pictures as well. It's fairly comfortable and stays in place. I would recommend this product and may return to purchase more. I would recommend this product to others. I gave this wig 4 out of 5 stars because it is on the small side. I payed $8.69 and free S&H when I purchased this item.,4
"The item arrived on time as promised, packaged well in perfect condition. The quality of the oil is exceptional and was used immediately. I am extremely happy with this product line and will continue to purchase them as needed.",5
"I own Scunci octopus clips and DCNL Octopus clips.There are several significant differences.1) The DCNL Hair clip sold by Sally Beauty SupplyDCNL Tortoise Octopus Hair Cliphas a firmer spring than the Scunci Hair ClipsScunci No-slip Grip Octopus Clip, 8.5 Cm, Colors may vary.  If you have long or heavy hair (I do), the DCNL clip will hold your hair more securely than the Scunci.2)Also, the DCNL clip has tine tips that angle back in towards the clip (away from your head) making it much more comfortable against the scalp. The scunci clips do angle in, but not as much and still poke my scalp.3)The Scunci also have non-slip rubber pads mounted in them that catch a few hairs (in the gaps between the rubber pads and the plastic tines) and pull them out. i lose a few hairs everytime I use the scunci clips.Though they both look the same on the surface, these three qualities make the DCNL well worth the extra $3. After I found the DCNL clips, I tossed my Scunci clips.Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful!",2
After that minimal steam. Cool mist worked ok. I agee with previous review. Towel and a pot of steaming water for me.,1
I like this product a lot! My skin gets oily during the day and it helps me to remove the oil in a second without touching any make up!It sits in my purse as the emergency kit!,5
"I am have african textured hair 4b/c and i have been natural for about 3 years. I have not been able to get a wash and go look with any other product than the eco styler gels (i have used white, pink and olive oil like them all but pink made my scalp itch)i tried Kinky curly and although my hair did curl to my shock it dried horribly very gooey and sticky and white and i still had a lot of shrinkage. I tried the eco early on and although i saw some curl when it dried there was no definition or curl pattern. Finally i saw something on You Tube I think it was African Export and she was saying for our hair type you have to pile it on and actually apply like a relaxer. I NEVER would have though to do that. I would have thought that would be way, way to much gel. Well it works! my edges have not laid this smooth since i had a relaxer and my hair has living breathing curls. I cannot believe it, i just keep looking at my hair going, whose head of hair is that. My curls clump together and it dried beautifully, I use shea butter underneath (when i dont my hair is a bit dry) and it does turn white but i find if i rub out the excess when it dries its just fine. My advice try it and if you have very tightly coiled and dry hair dont be afraid to be heavy handed with the product you can always scale back later if you apply to much but the only way you will know what your hair can do is if you go for it.",5
"this product does everything it says,,, I was skeptical at first , but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly fast and I love the smell and lather of this product. EC",5
"Gets very hot, so wearing the glove is essential.  Does not burn hair, though, and does the job well.",4
"I've been using this product in concert with theClear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounceand have been having a pretty good experience. The conditioner is a bit thick, but easy to work into my long, thick hair. It has a light floral scent that doesn't linger, so it works for men as well as women. The conditioner rinses well and, while it's not revolutionizing my hair, it is certainly helping to keep the flyaways and frizzies at bay.I generally try to vary my shampoo and conditioning products from time to time so that I don't get too much buildup in my hair, and this is one product that will be joining the rotation.",4
Have tried four of the Vaseline moisturizer products and this is my favorite. This makes my skin feel great and has a very mild scent that I like. I am not crazy about moisturizers that have a strong scent and was critical of another Vaseline moisturizer (the Men fast absorbing) because of that but I really like this. This has an even milder scent than the Vaseline Cocoa Radiant moisturizer and the Vaseline Total Moisture moisturizer and feels even better on the skin.I have dry skin. This feels great when it goes on and then even better after it is rubbed into my skin. Even though it is not listed as a product that is quickly absorbed into the skin I found it to be absorbed  quickly. It has very little greasiness.I am a strong believer in aloe and I think this helps my dry skin. My elbows can get very dry at times and this really has helped with that problem. My hands can also get nicked up a bit after doing yard work and this helps them feel better.This really works well and I am impressed. It is my favorite of the Vaseline Total Moisture products.,5
I do my own nails and these are perfect. Sizes to fit fingers and toes. Just like the ones at the salon.,5
"I'd been eyeing this product waiting for our Cetaphil to run out. We finally bought this product and I'm not a fan of it .On the skin it left our 11 month old daughter's legs very ashy and this hadn't happened since we stopped using Johnson and Johnson. She and I battle with eczema on and off and it did not help or feel gentle. Instead, our skin was dried out a bit.It seems pretty good on the hair, though, leaves it soft and shiny.We will be going back to Cetaphil to use to clean our skin with and use the Aquaphor Baby as a shampoo for her.",2
Its not a kiddie blue (if that makes sense) this is a very sexy & sophisticated blue. I've brought this color to the nail salon when getting my nails done & I have gotten many compliments from young & old alike. Its very pretty & very feminine.,5
"This powder is a little more shimmery than I was expecting, so I've been using it as more of a highlighter than an all-over face powder as originally planned.  However! I do love it.  I highly recommend the blush, but who am I kidding, I own both and will probably purchase backups before they fade into the land of amazing, discontinued PF products.",4
"These are tiny pads and I feel their makeup remover wiped work much better than these pads.  I have used half of the pack and feel that most of the time, a pad does not remove as much as it should (and it is kind of rough on the eye area, which is very sensitive!)",2
"I am an African-American woman with natural 4a hair. I first bought this product during the beginning of my natural know hair care journey. I didn't much about hair back then, so I didn't realize how drying it was. It stripped my hair and made it feel unhealthy. It almost made my hair feel as though there was relaxer in it again. The ingredients are terrible in my opinion and I highly recommend that anyone with hair similar to mine to avoid it. This might work better for people with naturally straight hair, but I'm not sure. I will never use it again. I still have a little bit of it left. It was kind of expensive, so I might use it to shave my legs with.",1
"I used Clearasil when I was a teenager and loved it for the clean, fresh smell and the way my skin felt after washing it.  Now that I have pre-teen children, I just knew they needed it too.  I was surprised to see that salicylic acid had been added and that there was a new formula.  I have used it several times but don't expect to see major changes in my skin b/c I don't get breakouts or have acne at my age.  The kids have used it and remarked that they've noticed a cleaner feel in their skin.",4
"If you have any open wounds (from pimples, etc), application of this cream will sting a bit. You will also notice that this night cream doesn't exactly smell good. That's probably why it's a ""night cream."" But, does it do anything to you skin? Yes. Just a few days into applying it, I've started to notice my skin feeling like a baby's.",4
"I recently ordered the Laura Mercier tightline cake, but instead of ordering her more expensive brush, bought this one instead since I had read that it's a great dupe.  It works fantastically for tightlining your eyes!  The flat bristles enable you to get the product right into your lashline on both the top and bottom of you eye, and it places the perfect amount of product on your eyes.  This is the fourth Sigma brush I've purchased, and they've all been fantastic quality!",5
"I was using cotton to separate my big toe from the toe next to it to prevent them overlapping.  These little gel spacers are so much more comfortable.  I did not realize they come 2 in a package, and ordered 2 packages, so I have a couple of extras--and I can probably find some kind of use for them.  I ordered the large size, but they do seem a bit bulky, so I will order the small size to see if they fit a bit less obtrusively.",5
"OMG is all I can say about this! Who would of ever guessed how smooth and soft this would make your face, I got this not to long ago and after the 1st use my face was super smooth, just like a babies butt Lol. It gets off all the dry dead skin off your face and I can't believe what a difference my makeup looks like on my face, smooth, flawless and glowing! I use just a tiny bit everyday with my cleanser and bam there you have it! This is a must have!",5
I Love Rose Scent but....I had to literally throw this away!The scent .... was so STRONG...it gave me a headache!I have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!,1
I haven't owned a hair dryer in 14 years but wanted to get it to help condition my hair....also when people come over to stay they often need one....right price and works great.,5
This was the size I needed for my mothers short hair. The product worked as well as I hoped and I'm happy with them.,5
"I've been using my Divine Age Guardian Cream morning and night for the last few weeks and have been impressed! My skin has not been dry at all (even while using heavy acne-fighting products) and my skin looks brighter and feels softer and smoother than it has in awhile!This time of year my sun spots usually start to pop out more, especially on my forehead because I'm in the sun a whole bunch, but while using this awesome cream, my sun spots have been very minimal and if anything, have faded a bit, even though I always get more nasty sun spots in the summer!",5
I like the fact that it self levels right before your eye's. It's was pretty tricky the first time I applied it. But I got better over time and understanding of the product. And please disregard the 1 star rating by someone who has yet to even use this product.FYIIf you're looking to buy the dark pink builder it's really not noticeable on your nail. So your probably be better off with the clear or light pink builder.,5
"I have waist length 1B hair, undyed, unprocessed. I use no hair dryers or heat devices. That would seem to make this product particularly not for me. However, it adds a finishing touch to my hair that is better than anything I have used. I used this product with the Motions cleanser and leave in conditioner.Using only a drop or two (one pump is plenty) my hair transforms to sleek and shiny. I first used this at a recent high school reunion; people constantly came up to me and touched my hair, commenting on how good it looked. I've never been that person and it was very gratifying. I can't emphasize enough how little you need....I have a lot of hair and one pump is more than enough.This is a tremendous product for a lovely professional looking polish to your hair!",5
I am very skeptical when it comes to hair products. I have unusual hair that is very fine but have a lot of it. It's also curly in most spots. So it's easier to just straighten my hair than try to let it go naturally curly. But this Just For Me Hair Milk Curl Smoother actually helps enhance my curls so I don't have to straighten all the time. Love it! It's lightweight and soft but so manageable. Great product!,5
"I love their products.  They found my curls after years of thinking they were gone.  I don't use the dryer everytime I wash my hair, but when I use it, it never ruins the curls or turns them into frizz the way my onld difuser did.  I LOVE IT!",5
"I received this product as a sample with a Skin79 BB cream pack that I bought from Katie the Babe.  I am normally super picky with cleansers because my skin is super super sensitive and often perfumed soap and cleanser break me out in a mild allergy rash, but I was out of my normal cleanser and my face felt icky after a long day at work and 101 degree Texas weather.  I must say I was extremely impressed with this cleanser it was very gentle on my skin, extremely effective and I love the way it smells really clean.  I followed it up with my hypoallergenic lotion and my skin feels better than it ever has.  I have a hard time finding something I like this much. I have true combination skin it's dry and flaky on my chin, between my eyes, and on both sides of my nose but my cheeks and forehead are very oily and acne prone.  I have a feeling this cleanser would do wonders for my skin with extended use and I love it as much as the other Skin79 products I have tried.  This is also a very versatile cleanser as I think it would work well for any age or skin type and even though it has a heavy fragrance it seems very mild.  I love it!!",5
"This soap is smooth, suds well and does not leave a residue.  Teamed up with the bleach cream, it makes you feel great.",5
"Considering the price, these are great brushes. I don't have any problems with bristles coming off. The case is very nice with a double clear protective screen to encase the brushes. The only downside of this set is a lack of a smudge brush.",4
This thing ( adapter doesn't work after 2nd use ) if I squeeze it and hold it works. I would like to contact seller and exchange it for new adapter so I can use this drill . I love this machine And like I said I just need new adapter.  Please contact me .i Dont know how to contact you. Thanks,1
A nice product.  I used this a few hours after shaving and it return my face to the moment just after shaving and using a post-shave balm.This is a lotion but it doesn't have that greasy feeling to it.I also like that the scent is very faint and has a distinctively masculine smell. (We all know that Dove products are primarily catered to older women)I like this product a lot.,5
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE ORIGINAL HEMPTZ LOTION AS WELL AS CITRUS AND A COUPLE OTHERS. BUT FOR ME NOTHING BEATS THE ORIGINAL SCENT AS WELL AS THE SOFTNESS IT BRINGS MY SKIN.",5
"I was skeptical about using this product because in my opinion L'Oreal although their products are awesome, they are heavily perfumed. I have super sensitive skin and senses and I can't use things that are really perfumy. I am going to try this because I am getting older and my dermatologist says it is time to start preventive maintenance. At 36, I do not have wrinkles yet but I do have age spots. The discoloration is from all the time in the sun in my past, hopefully this product will help with that.",3
Love the end results of using this brush...my skin feels soft and smooth.,5
"Rimmel lash accelerator is just fine is you want a basic, black mascara.  However, I did not find that it accelerated my lash growth at all, or even made them look longer when I was wearing it.  L'Oreal Voluminous False Fiber Lashes is better for temporary lengthening.",2
"I have very thick hair and a lot of it. Every hair elastic I buy will either break with time, or snap the first time I attempt to use it. I needed something a lot more stretchable and durable. So far, these elastics have worked. Pleasantly surprised. They don't seem very durable but time will tell. I will keep searching for the perfect elastic and rate it a 5 star product..Hopefully it exists.",4
"Seche Vite is a necessity! Doesn't matter how cheap, thin, or thick, your nail polish is, it will go on smoothly and dry within 5 minutes. And sometimes I just use it on my natural nails because it makes them smooth and protected. I've tried other top coats and this one works wonders, staying on for days and fighting to protect your nails from the world. Buy buy buy!",5
"Nexcare's Acne Absorbing Covers have been a handy item to have stocked in my medicine cabinet for those bad face days. While I didn't expect miracles, these little circular disks actually worked as they said they would on certain types of zits. The only ones they don't appear to work on are those pesky under the skin-types, which I figured might be the case, but overall I'm impressed. I applied one cover to a new, rather smallish, and only slightly pink pimple on my cheek, and not twelve hours later I could already see where it had turned white. When I took it off I couldn't believe the amount of oil/pus it had absorbed, it was really rather gross to be honest, and I hadn't even kept it on for the max forty-eight hours. So yeah, I think I'll keep using these for particular blemishes and will buy more if the price is right. I also like that I don't feel them on my face and they don't irritate my sometimes sensitive skin. These clear disks come in two sizes and are rather thick, so even though it says they can be covered in make-up, the edges will definitely show through. I'd recommend wearing them when you're in the comfort of your own home, as they're not the most inconspicuous, unless it's in a spot that isn't so visible.Pros:- two different sizes and a total of thirty-six in the box- mostly works as purported- comfortable- non-irritating for sensitive skin- keeps from touching/picking- can visibly see it's working- drug-freeCons:- fairly thick so they're not as invisible as I'd like- doesn't work for all types of blemishes",4
I only use non aluminum deodorants and am constantly looking for something better.  This works better than Toms but is still just a deodorant not an antiperspirant.  It smells nice and goes on easily.  It is worth a try if you are trying to avoid aluminum.  The biggest con is the price.,4
"I was a little skeptical of this purchase at first, someone at work told me that it smelled great.  I purchased it, not knowing at all how it smelled, but it turned out to be one of the best purchases I have ever made.  If you haven't tried this one, your really should!",5
I actually had people asking me what I did to my skin. Even my mom was surprised and I gave her a cup of it.,5
"I have been using this 2x a day for about a week now and really like it. I don't have to use as much under eye concealer. It seems to take away the puffyness too. I can't wait to try a bunch of their other products, they look amazing.",5
"The men in my family strongly prefer 2 in 1 shampoos to messing with conditioner. This shampoo gets hair clean and conditions decently. It smells good too. The fragrance isn't overpowering, and a nice clean scent.Good value, it's inexpensive and gets the job done.",4
"Looks thrilling though!With white shiny swirlling ribbons of ""eye treatment"" that doesn't do anything but put micro-glitter under yours eyes for lighting effect.",2
"It's a small practice finger, about the size of a kid's. That's not a bad thing for me though, as it makes it easier to move around while I work on the nail art. Overall, it was just as I expected and wanted, so I'm satisfied. Nothing flashy though, as it's literally...a plastic finger.",3
"Received a month later, however, it was noted when purchased. I wasn't in no rush as it was a Christmas present and it came on time. Brushes are extremely soft. Love the feel of it and the variety of sizes. It also came in a pretty hot pink pouch. I only wish I would've ordered myself one too. Will recommend. Don't anticipate speedy delivery thou.",5
"WAYYYY to scared to use this device on my skin. After watching some videos on youtube on how to use this on your face, I realized that it is only meant for professionals. That said, it came well packed and seems medical grade. Would be perfect for a professional dermatologist's office.",5
I got a sample of this at Sephora.  I LOVED the smell.  I wanted something more mature but wasn't too strong or old grandma.  I LOVE This.  It smells amazing. It comes in a super cute heart shaped bottle with a cute crown at the top.  If you like the smell you should buy this.,5
"I have a natural red tone to my medium/dark blonde hair. I recently lightened it by just one shade and the red tones were made more pronounced. So, I bought this product hoping that it would neutralize this effect. I followed the directions properly and it actually darkened my hair color and I seem to have even more red tones to my hair. This was a total waste of my money and time. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would have given it 0 stars if I could.",1
"Honestly, I was actually hoping I wouldn't like this.  I already have too many Axe products -- various scents of anti-antiperspirants, shampoos, conditioner, 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioners, body washes, body scrubs, hair goos, you name it.  I am beginning to have more stuff in the bathroom than my wife ;-) I don't find the body washes and shampoos all that different, and I figured this might just be some ploy to repackage a similar formulation into a face wash.But, it's not.  Actually, I really do like it.  It is super concentrated.  A pea or bean sized amount is plenty to wash my face.  It is very gentle on my skin YET cleans it as well as the harsher body washes.  I even found it works well on ""delicate"" parts which can be irritated by harsher soaps.As for the packaging, I was a bit disappointed that 1/3 is filled with air.  Yes, just above the clear window of the bottle is where the contents stop.  But, no big. 5 oz is 5 oz.Regarding the scent, with a name like Chilled and menthol on the ingredients list, I was expecting a cheap overly minty/menthol smell.  Instead, it is definitely more herbal.  It contains a lot of plant extracts/botanicals.  The minty chill is barely noticeable to me.  I would almost describe it more of a salon kind of cucumber kind of smell.  It, therefore, feels and smells very luxurious.I have the dreaded ""combination"" skin with some oily, some dry, and some normal.  I felt this did a much better job at not making my face feel tight and dry (Winter cold air mind you) than the regular Axe body washes.So, looks like I will have another Axe product on the shelf...",5
"I have been using this for close to 10 years now. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. My fiancee LOVES this smell on me so much, he is always happy with purchasing me a new bottle when I run out! I just LOVE it! Fragrance is lightly layered with flowers and hint of chocolate.",5
"I used some expensive serum that worked very well but I decided to try some cheaper ones to see if they would work the same so I can save some money. Oil of Olay never did anything to my face but since it is an ""more expensive"" product of this brand so I expect it would be good. Used the whole bottle but nothing happened. Face felt greasy like usual, spots didn't fade away, skin texture has no improvement. In short, nothing happened but not the worst thing I have tried. So I give it a 3 star. I don't think I will buy it again. Will try another brands",3
"These dried flowers are to big for nail art use.  They should be smaller and more defined in design.  When you put them on they take up the entire nail and then get mushy, so it does not look right at all. I say it is not a good use of your money.",2
"The Thera Pearl Eye-ssential Mask mimics the idea of &#34;peas&#34; (frozen peas in a bag) that can be used for a headache or sore eyes, puffiness.  The mask can be used in hot or cold mode but for me, cold is always when I opt for.  I placed mine in the freezer for three hours and this was enough time to bring it to a nice cool freeze.  The mask never turned &#34;frozen&#34; and was pliable the entire time.  I found that it stayed cool for about 30 minutes before it began to lose it's coolness.The mask is comfortable and effective for tired eyes or an achey head.  The elastic strap can be removed via a snap.  You can decide whether you want to use the strap or not.I received my mask as a sample for review.",5
This was much darker than I expected from the tiny pictures. I think it will work best in the colder months.,3
"I am a long-time fan of Dove Sensitive Skin bar soap.  I am of Swiss/Irish heritage and have the combination of light skin, blond hair, and red beard--at least it was red until it mysteriously changed to white.  Any deodorant that is not hypoallergenic causes me discomfort, changing soaps when washing clothes makes me itch, too much sun causes sun poisoning, and poison ivy sends me straight to the emergency room.  So I tend to stay with articles of personal hygiene that work for me.One day I noticed Dove Body Wash for Sensitive Skin and decided to give it a try.  Couldn't be much different from Dove bar soap, right?  And thankfully it isn't.  It is a nice thick body wash that soaps up well and is easy to rinse off.  I also often use it on my hair instead of some expensive shampoo that does the same job at a much higher cost.  That's a trick I learned from using the bar soap one day when there was no shampoo in the shower.So this stuff works great for me.  Keep your eye on the price difference between the bar soap and this body wash.  Sometimes the body wash works out to be cheaper per ounce than the bar soap.",5
"Unfortunately, I found it to be too good to be true. I thought this would be able to replace my morning shower, but I still find that I need to shower to make sure my hair does not look oily. However, this product is great at styling and could be used to give the impression that you just gelled your hair after a shower.",4
This is a very nice organic foundation.  This foundation is very smooth and creamy and perfect for dry skin.  I wouldn't recommend this on oily skin.  My daughter has severe acne rosacea and sensitive skin and she had no problem wearing this foundation.  The problem is that for her it didn't have enough coverage for her very red acne rosacea.  My daughter doesn't have the patience nor does she like to build the foundation for coverage.  I would definitely give this foundation a try.,5
"I have very sensitive skin and never could wear makeup. That is until about 8 years ago when I discovered Bare Minerals. It goes on smooth and makes your skin look radiant. It is so good for your skin you can even go to bed without taking it off. I love using the pink/red shadows on the lips then going over it with their clear gloss, makes a very pulled together look.So glad I found this. If you are sensitive give it a try.",5
"In Japan, lotion MEANS toner and milk MEANS the equivalent of American lotion. That's why it's so watery. Excellent product though and the toner (i.e. lotion) also contains Hyaluronic Acid so it too will be moisturizing...",5
I have used this twice with very great results.  The directions were excellent and I have achieved the results that I desired.  Just follow the directions and it will go smoothly.,5
Didnt like this foundation to pale and oily for my skin I wouldn't recommend this product especially if you have oily skin.,2
"It kind of runs in my eyes and I can not tell a big difference. It's better than some cheap ones that I've tried, but Strivectin is still my favorite.",3
"I was given samples of this sunscreen by my dermatologist to use before and after a laser-like procedure that caused my face to be super sensitive. I liked it a lot, was very gentle, unlike the better known national brand sunscreens for the face that I tried when I ran out of Vanicream. Having read about how good zinc oxide based sunscreens are for you, I bought more and decided to use it on my neck, arms and legs while playing golf last week. I guess due to the perspiration, it ran onto my clothes and I have not been able to get it out after 2 washings. You also have to wash well with soap and water to get it off your skin. This is not to knock the product - it is outstanding.",3
"OK this product came lightning fast!!!!  2 days ship time and making me smile!!!I recieved this product and was so so so excited to use it that I jumped in the shower about 30 minutes later and gave it a whirl.We have horrible well water where I live and my hair is dead and dry and literally feels like grass. I have been looking for a conditioner to soften and strengthen my hair.This product worked very very nicely. It smells nice too, a soft clean scent. It said to put a dime size amount in hair and let set for two minutes. My hair is below my shoulders so i increased the amount to 2 dime size dollops and waited about 5 minutes before rinsing and WOW WOW WOW, my new favorite conditioner BY FAR. My hair combed right through for the first time in maybe a year since we moved in to the worst well water house this side of the Mississippi!!! It dried much softer than it has since then as well. The smell didn't linger in my hair(although it was pleasant) and left no heavy residue either. I give this product a 5 star rating and do recommend it to anyone looking to revive their long lost beautiful hair again. The silkiness level of my hair from Adovia Mineral Skin Care's- Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner, IS PHENOMENAL AND WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!",5
"I chose to try out this Clear Scalp & Hair scalp & hair oil to see if it would help with my flaky, dry scalp. I've always had dandruff and flaking issues, and have used other oils and creams in combination with dandruff shampoos in the past, with mixed results. I'm happy to report that this product seems to work pretty well. I use a decent sized amount (about the size of two quarters in your hand) and scrub it into my hair and scalp about 5 minutes before showering. I find that it really helps to loosen everything up to help the shampoo work more effectively.This is probably a product that's going to vary in effectiveness between different people and hair types. If you have thicker hair, you might find yourself needing to use more to see any benefit. Most people probably use this as a leave-in solution without washing it out right away - I personally can't see myself doing that because it is very greasy, and I don't use leave in oils or gels. Again, there are different uses and effectiveness for different people. At the low price, you can't really go wrong giving it a try. I'd recommend using a lesser amount first just to make sure your head isn't overly oily, and adjust as needed.",4
"Weird title, right? Lots of shampoos/conditioners have products that are intended to make your hair shiny and soft but will aggravate body acne. When you rinse off your hair all of those oils, waxes, and other baddies that make you locks look fabulous run down your back/body and clog up your pores. This line of products does a great job of keeping my chemically highlighted hair looking soft and manageable while not messing up my skin. Plus, it smells great too!",5
"I have been using this about once a week for the past couple of months.  I bought it to deal with a stubborn breakout on my upper chest that nothing would clear.  It didn't work overnight, but after a few applications, the skin is much clearer.  I also use it on my face.  It definitely helps to clear pores, but there are still some blackheads that won't go away.  It burns a lot for the first couple of minutes, but after that, I can easily tolerate it for ten or fifteen  minutes with no trouble and no ill effects.  My skin rarely peels afterward.  Occasionally I get slight peeling in the corners of my nose and mouth.  I haven't noticed any change in lines or wrinkles, but for dealing with acne or clogged pores, it is effective and worth a try.  Don't expect instant results, but with a little patience you will likely see signifi ant improvement.",4
If your thinking of getting these for wash cloths...DON'T.  If you want something thin and flimsy for a rag then go ahead and buy them.,1
I watched the infomercial and I thought I must try this to get that smooth silky hair. This product doesn't lather and doesn't remove oil from the hair enough. This would be a decent conditioner but not for a shampoo.,2
"Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding. I did tons of research and came up with a non-salon regimen that works for me. I use Hoofmaker Hand and Nail lotion, Nailtiques Plus 2, Zeva Crystal file, and Zeva Nail Brite. Finally, I use 2 different cuticle cream a few x's per day - Barielle cuticle cream. Barielle's cuticle cream dries nicely. All of this together has made a huge difference. I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice.",5
I love this lotion. It works great smekks good and makes my skin so soft. I noticed a difference in my tan the first time i used it. Ive used many different lotions but im going to stick with thus one.,5
It smells like a nursing home.  My mother uses it.  It smells horrible. I have to burn incense just to try to cover up the smell of it.,1
This is good quality make up but meant for younger skin as its got too much shininess to it. Fast service?,3
"My curly hair series dies detangle which makes styling easier the extra conditioning protects my locks from heat damage and knots. The scent is light and clean. I like using this product on wet, damp and dry stages.",3
The honey scent is very strong in this product. It has decent hold and helps with volume but I find myself with a headache if I wear too much because of the scent.,3
It's not much as i thought and the containers are so small this product will be gone before you know it.,3
"I like the  Toni and Guy Nourish shampoo and I think that this conditioner works well with it.The conditioner feels great. It spreads easily though the hair so you don't have to use too much. I leave it on a few minutes and rinse it out. The only downside is if you don't get it fully rinsed your hair will be quite sticky. But if you take a minute to rinse thoroughly, it leaves your hair soft and nice. My hair was easy to style. It wasn't weighed down at all.",4
"I ordered this eye cream for night use.  I'm in my early 30's and have noticed that my eye area has started to dry out.  The price of the cream is good for the amount of cream that you get, but it's very runny.  If I store the bottle on the lid as it is in the picture, when I remove the cap, the cream comes rushing out all over the place.  The cream does help to hydrate, but it's not hydrating enough for me.  I won't be reordering.",3
works alot better then the glue i was using. last pretty long and is super cost effective for us divas who need our lashes =],5
This hair spray mist doesn't leave your hair sticky and stiff.  What it does do is leaves your hair feeling soft.  Spray mist holds your style in place.  It doesn't have the aerosol smell that is so strong and over powering. It's good for the enviroment.  Will purchase the Giovanni Organic Styling Mist again and again.,5
"I have to admit I was initially amused when this product came onto the market. A ""manly"" shower loofah? Who would've thought of that? The folks at Axe. It all makes perfect sense now.The Axe ""Detailer"" Shower Tool has the looks of a car's radiator cap, and when you've got ""Tool"" in the name and the product looks like a car part, you have marketing genius at it's finest. It's actually more than just a novelty product for guys, though. It works fairly well in the shower and delivers on what it promises. It creates a good lather no matter what kind of shower gel you are using (not just Axe), and the scrubber side works well on rough elbows and feet.Overall, this nifty little product from Axe has the looks to appeal to men, and the results to warrant being kept as an every day shower tool.",4
"I've only had this a short while, so I'll be sure to update my review if anything changes after I've had this awhile.  So far, it works great!Be sure to peel off the protective sticker when you first get this; it's really thin, and I can see why a few reviewers missed it.  Once you fill it with water, it stays fogless, no matter how hot your shower is.I've already dropped it twice on my tile shower floor, and it hasn't cracked at all.Great buy!  I'm glad I picked this up.",5
"I really like the BH palettes - this one was a little smaller than I imagined, but still a decent size - the colors are very pigmented and last all day with primer.  I have only used it a few times, but I like it!",4
"I got this free to try. This can be used on your hair or skin and boy was this one good timing also.  Last week I used a deodorant I was very allergic too.  My underarms and the back of my arms broke out in a very dry and cracking rash.  I tried lotions and everything else I could think of, then this fantastic oil showed up.  I used it twice a day on my underarms and the back of my arms and after the first day could already tell a difference.  After about 3-4 days the dry spots were basically gone.  This was fantastic oil.  I am going to try on my legs next.  With the hot weather coming I am not going to have ashy legs this summer.",5
Good product for the price. Trick is to hold the dotting tool straight while dipping into polish. I like it.,5
"awesome, perfect case for nail stamping set. It is easy to carry and fit in almost any purse, at least that`s what my girlfriend told me. she really likes it.",5
"I bought this because of all the rave reviews... honestly its kindve average. The bristles are actually silicone so that was different. I compared this to my maybelline full n soft mascara... I dont think Im a fan of mascara, Ive sampled sheer cover mascara... I still have not found my mascara. The differeence I can see from the full n soft, is that with full n soft, after 2 layers, it starts to clump, but it looks natural, with just the 2... with this 2 layers is not enough, and as you keep putting on layers, they dont really clump, they looking fuller, but not longer... one day I will find my mascara, but this isnt it. Bonus it washes off real nice, no raccoon eyes after washing your face to clean up!",4
"this product does not smell. i ordered a different one once and it smelled like crap. very unhappy but this product i have purchased several times without any problems with smell. i use this on my ends of my hair and my entire face. great benefits to hair, nails and face",4
"When I first went natural, I spent a small fortune trying to find products that would do a myriad of different things for my dry, thirsty, unruly 3C hair(i.e. give my curls length, no frizz, shine, nice scent, not sticky, provide hold without stiffness, etc.). Well Africa's Best Kid's Organics Extra Virgin Olive Oil Plus Shea Butter Detangling Moisturizing Hair Lotion does it all AND is cheap to boot. Yes, it does a nice job of detangling on just washed & conditioned hair but there's another big plus. It's also perfect for both wet and dry braid outs. It keeps curls tamed but still gives my hair some freedom. It provides enough hold to keep my style in check without frizz and smells SO good. This lotion also ""plays nice"" with my other styling products (Vanilla Silk shine serum and Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) so that when I need more hold and extra shine it doesn't make a big mess. I also don't need to use it every day to get a nice style. When I braid my hair for the night at the end of Day 2, I lightly spritz a little water mixed with my favorite hair oil, put a tiny bit of the lotion on my ends, and my curls stretch out more and more as the days go by (3 days max without a wash or I'll lose my mind!). I just hope this stuff stays on the market forever. Seems like the minute I find a product I love, some big wig decides to fix what ain't broke and I'm back to square one. So while it's here give it a try. At this price, you've got nothing to lose.",5
"If you look in a 10x mirror after using this, you will find clear, clean pores.  This is the kind of Ponds that doesn't feel thick, and has a mild scent. I have great skin and have been using Pond's products for decades.",5
"I was in need of a new nail drill, so I came on amazon and looked through a lot of them and I found this one and knew it was exactly what I wanted.",5
"I've been using this product on my 2 year old since he was several months old.  He was allergic to everything before this product.  It works really well and doesn't cause the eczema type rashes all the others caused. It is great and lasts a long time, unlike the cheaper knock off's.",5
I bought this during Christmas at a Dept store and spent way to much. I was so happy to see that Amazon carried this fragrance and it was priced very nice!,5
"Beautiful Barbie pink color.3 coats needed to achieve true color. Compliments any skin color. No shimmer, just opaque cr&egrave;me pink.",5
"Razor technology has reached a very high plateau with even the cheapest razors doing a fine job of removing unwanted body hair. These razors are upscale fancy ones, with extra blades a comfy grip and built-in  lotion/moisturizer. I found they worked well and gave me a nice smooth shave. Would I purchase them? Yes, but the price would have to be good. I prefer razors that are long-lasting with less plastic to go in the landfill. So far, this razor has stayed sharp and continuously given me a good shave- however they have more plastic than other cheaper razors, and I would prefer less plastic packaging to go in the landfill.Overall, nice product, will continue to use to see how they hold up.",4
They use this in my salon and I had to get some.  Not only does it dry fast it is very shiny.  I use it every couple of days to keep my manicure/acrylic nails fresh looking.  You don't need to pay the exorbitant cost of gel nails ($30 for plain in my area every two weeks)  if you put this over your regular polish frequently.,5
Perfect...as described and delivered quicklyRecommended for all who love gel nails.  The benefits of covering your skin while using the UV light are obvious. and...it makes nail care so much easier!,5
"I've used this product twice before and decided to buy my own from Walgreens for $4.99. It's a good product, it doesn't really have a smell to it and for the size of the bottle it's a good prize to me. Just follow the directions I normally leave it on my face for 20-30 minutes or until it turns light green. It's a little hard to get off so I would recommend you rinse your face several times with warm water then wash your face with soap. My face felt a little dry afterwards so I applied Lubriderm lotion to it and my face felt smooth. I noticed instead of my pimples being raised they were flat once I took the mask off. If you have time I would suggest you use once or twice a week or every night before you go to sleep or wake up in the morning.",5
This is really loved as all the colors look so real. it is a hard plastic and it have long durability,5
"Many different colors that all have glitter! You will be shinning every day. This works great with the Shany UV light. The outcome is great and it stays on for weeks without chipping. The only thing that I noticed was it was difficult to remove the glitter, you have to really scrub it off.",4
"This is by far my favorite B&B scent (I hate their vanilla scents and their fruity scents, they're too darn sweet smelling!) But this lotion isn't too sweet smelling at all.  It smells like lavender but with a more sophisticated scent .... it's hard to explain. I recommend this product hands down!",5
"My only complaint is that I use the concentrator attachment regularly and the attachment snaps on really loosely, so the concentrator (the attachment that you use to narrow the heat concentration) rotates and changes angle multiple times when I'm trying to blow my hair dry. It's pretty annoying, but I'm learning to deal with it. Overall, it was really cost effective and it's small so it will be good for traveling, and it's pretty powerful too.",3
It really was thick and did not go on as I had hoped....color good consistency was not asI had hoped.,1
I love this oil. I have very dry skin and hair and this along with a little glycerin in a bottle of filtered water creates the perfect moisturizing mist. I have naturally dry curly hair and this creates that seal unlike any other oil I ever use. Great for eyebrow and eyelash treatments also if they are thin or thinning! Only need a little as castor oil is very thick and sticky. But this bottle has lasted me forever and I highly recommend it.,5
I love this product and everything about it. It was smaller than I had thought but its so cute that it is worth every penny; and I'm not just saying that becuase it also works great. I have tried one image on each plate and they came out very good.,5
"I love this stuff! I apply to damp hair and then brush, then braid. my hair. Leave in, it has made a HUGE difference in frizz, health, etc....LOVE THIS!",5
"This face wash has very short ingredient list. It is great for sensitive skin. It doesn't leave tight dry skin for sure. It takes a bit to wash it off, it has weird thick texture (hard to describe).To my surprise it actually did good job in removing my face make up (not so much eye make up), so two thumbs up for that.",4
"I use this product everyday.  I color my hair and it has gotten coarser and frizzier with age.  This product calms my hair down and makes it sooooo soft.  My hairdresser gave me the tip of applying it before I color (diy) to help condition my hair and make it easier to comb the color through.  It also makes it easier to get the color off the skin around the hair line.  A little goes a long way, so I don't have to feel guilty for indulging in this product!",5
This highlighter is great for darker skin tones since it has a gold sheen/undertone. Also perfect when used with browns or neutral shades of eye shadow.,5
"I really did not see any benefit from this product- while it was easy enough to use, the smell was not so great (not overwhelming either) and for the size, it was overpriced.",2
I liked this spray but it was different then what expected I used the st topez along with it so I got really go results but I feel this product by itself would not have been excellent,3
"As long as you cut the &#34;stringy&#34; ends off, they work just fine. They do not come with glue. Over all I am pleased.",4
"My hair has been dried, fried and frizzy lately, so I picked up a bottle of this at the drugstore. For extra conditioning, I slathered it on and tied my hair in a ponytail and gave it an hour to soak in. After I washed and conditioned my hair, I applied some of this and I have to say it feels awesome. I love the coconut scent, and my hair feels a lot healthier and less snarly and tangled, but it doesn't feel greasy or coated. Plus it's a decent price, too. I'm much happier with this than more expensive products I've bought in the past.",5
I wish I had read the reviews better.  This is not made for my hair type.  I was over moisturized and super greasy.,3
Not completely natural but it is healthier than other shower gels. This doesn't lather very well. The scent is light and sweet. I wouldn't repurchase this because there are better options out there.,4
"This product is far superior to the other brand which makes a similar product, and cheaper. Medicine Mama's product had a superior consistency (creamy and easily spreadable) and has less of a beeswax smell. This &#34;bee cream&#34; is amazing for dry feet, nighttime face moisturizer, and general deep moisturizer.  It's best used in winter or for VERY dry skin. I love that it also comes in a stick for use on-the-go. Love it!!",5
"I got this for my daughter, but I wish I'd kept it for myself.  My hair is very thick, very coarse, very frizzy, and a few inches below my shoulders.  It's dyed but about 50% gray naturally, and gray hair is even frizzier and harder to straighten.  I'd always used a 1&#34; straightener, which took forever.  The 2&#34; works so much better on my challenging hair, getting the job done in much less time, and it lasts a long time, too.  Also I love the temperature adjustments.  Most flat irons won't go above 390 degrees.  Make sure you use heat protector on your hair or it will definitely get fried!  And the automatic shut-off will be a live saver (perhaps literally), as I am known to forget to turn off my flat iron on a regular basis.In the past I have used a Chi and currently use the very pricy GHD which I bought only a year ago, but I'm thinking I will have to bite the bullet and get one of these Remingtons for myself.",5
All these colors are frosty shiny - see far away lip colors! Wow! As a cougar myself I don't know how many of us wear frosty glow in the dark colors of the 70's / 80's. I wear them at home - never out... it would seem like I was trying to be 17 again. Pretty colors tho....,3
"wrong color. Impossible to match with your hair. There is no universal color guide listed, like everyone know 1 is jet black, 2 is off black and so on...",1
"These bows are SO cute.  I received them earlier than I thought I would, and that was a major plus.  The bows are really similar to the Hello Kitty style bows.  There's a wide variety of colors and they are just so adorable.",5
"this is a great little wheel, fits in the palm of my hands, I have medium sized hands. great combination of colors. Easy to use and with the way the wheel works shouldn't spill too easily.",5
"This was such a great deal , and i know i will be purchasing other products in the near future",5
"I can't believe how amazing this is. I've tried several different lotions and creams and can't find the cure for my dry cracked hands. Not only does winter make me dry out rapidly but working at a restaurant I wash my hands hundreds of times a day and my hands hurt.I have a couple thinner lotions so they dry quicker and I make sure they're non scented but they burn for the first few mins! They help but nothing to brag about. I read a review by a man that had dry cracked hands. Worked with his hands a lot and washed a lot as well said in 2 applications  it fixed his problem.I figured why not?! I found this product in store but smaller. Kind of tired spending 7-15 bucks on something I don't use. Bought the tiny, in your purse kind. I've used it twice. LOVE IT!!My hands were rough,cracked, bleeding.. Just ow..There's no fragrance. It's light weight, dries quick, not expensive and works the best in the 7 I have.I can't brag this up enough!",5
Just makes ya want to wash your face! I use a buff puff and a small amount of scrub. Ever so gently wash my face and the result is just radient! You'll love it.,5
"Hyaluronic acid is known for it's effects on skin, and, to the best of my knowledge, this particular brand of hyaluronic acid serum is the best available.  Pump a small amount into your hand and smooth it on your clean face.  If you're like me, you'll see significant improvement in the quality of your skin in a couple of weeks.  Pore size is reduced, and fine lines are smoothed away.I love it, and I'm delighted to recommend it to others.  Not just for women, everyone who wants smoother, glowing skin can benefit from this acid.  Give it a try.Five Stars!",5
"I'm not sure it's possible to combine anti-aging with exfoliation, but this product does not do it very well.  It foams and washes my face, but does not really exfoliate that well.",3
I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that I do not love it! It really works!,5
"I loved the fact that this conditioner doesn't have parabens or dyes.  Also, the smell is rather subtle (I'm not a big fan of strongly perfumed conditioners) and the liquid is thin enough not to clog my shower dispenser, which is what happened when I used tubes of Dove Nourishing Oil Care Daily Treatment Conditioner (it was too thick).As other reviewers have said, the packaging is a little strange in that the opening of the bottle is on the bottom rather than the top.  However, this is ideal for not having to squeeze the bottle for conditioner - it's easier to pour out from the bottom though you have to be careful to wipe away the excess and keep the cap firmly closed, since it will keep dripping downwards.Unfortunately, this conditioner is not as effective as others that I've used that give your hair some weight and body. In fact, the product description itself implies this: &#34;For longer lasting volume use with Natural Infusion All Day Body Leave-In Foam&#34;. I don't like products that suggest you use other products to supplement it, esp. volume when most conditioners offer this.So, while I really wanted to like this product, I have to say it's best for people who have thick hair and want to have less frizz and smoothness. If you have smooth, straight hair like mine that tends to be limp without extra help, I suggest looking elsewhere.",3
"I love this product.  I really love all the Fekkai products, but given their outrageous prices...I can't justify buying them.  My only exception is this product.  Even though this is expensive also, I find that a little goes a long way so a tube of this product lasts a long time.  I have shoulder length hair and only need about a pea size amount each day.  This cream also smells amazing!  It leaves my hair soft and shiny and more easily styled.  This product is worth the money to me.",5
"Suave Kids 3 In 1 Shampoo Conditioner and Body Wash, Pineapple, 22.5 OunceI got this to keep for when my grandchildren visit me.It seems to work just fine.  I suppose if you wanted to buy each type of product individually you might do better.To me, it was important not to have three different bottles to store and keep track of.I like the product.Gunner  February, 2014",4
I have long hair down to my waist and its fine and frizzy. I don't like to use a lot of product in my hair. I only use leave in conditioner and hairspray. This Fekkai leave in conditioner is light and leaves my hair fresh smelling and smoothes out the frizziness. I only condition the ends because I don't like my hair weighted down.,5
very impressed with the quality of brushes so far.gives a really nice finish to foundation etc.does not shed! yay!,4
Like a lot of women who wear wigs I have short hair so Trying to pull my hair through the small hole was a pain in the butt. Then my hair would stick up out of it and it would take 20 mins just to get in on comfortable! Such a pain! Tossed it right in the trash after 3 uses!,2
"I do not have sensitive skin & generally am able to use all kinds of beauty products.This little hand-held sonic power cleanser is a pretty nice tool - it is waterproof, so can be used in the shower, it seemed to do a good job getting makeup off of my face, and it was not big or bulky.I have a little trouble getting around cheekbones because the unit doesn't bend with my face, and I wish the built-in soap were a little gentler (or if the manufacturer offered a sensitive skin replacement soap pad in addition to the 2 choices currently offered).However, for the price of the device, it does an effective job.  It is a good starter for a teenager.",4
"I love this stuff! I use it on my cuticles when they're looking dry, and after I've let the oil soak in for a night, my nails and cuticles look like I've just had a manicure! I put some in my hair when the ends are looking dry, sparingly right out of the shower, or in larger quantities as an overnight treatment. Really softens up dead ends and has hair feeling much softer and looking healthier and shinier. I even use this on my oily, acne prone skin. When it's feeling parched, I'll put it on overnight over my moisturizer, or during the winter I'll mix a drop in with my moisturizing gel and my skin feels incredibly soft and quenched. Unlike any other lotion I've used! Even oily skin can feel dry, if that makes sense, and this takes care of it without making me more oily or causing breakouts. There are probably a million other uses for this but these are mine and I love it! Have repurchased once and plan on repurchasing again when I run out!",5
"I bought the starter kit from Sally's last night and wow! It is by far the easiest way to get perfect spiral curls from root to tip. I've gotten compliments all day today.I have long (between my shoulder blades when straightened) natural hair (mostly 3A, my texture varies) and even as a wet set it still produced smooth bouncy curls. I did use a setting lotion and sat under the dryer a little before finally sleeping in them, which wasn't that bad.They're so much easier to use than traditional plastic rollers but it does take some practice, especially when working the odd spots on your head.The starter kit was long enough for my hair although a couple pieces poked out of the end a little. Wasn't an issue though, I just pulled down a little further from the root to accommodate or left it alone if it wasn't sticking out too much. The 40 rods plus 6 shorts in the kit are plenty if you plan well. I sectioned into fours and tried to be sure 10 was my max for each section. I may pick up another add-on pack just so I won't have to keep thinking about how many I have left.In terms of cons, you can't really tell when they're dry since the hair is inside the roller. So if you're doing a wet set, give yourself enough drying time.Secondly, OUCH! if you don't have the hook just right on your hair it will tangle in already curly hair, so if it gets off as you start to pull it hurts like the dickens! But that gets better with practice. Once you get the technique down, it's actually fun! The swoosh snap was like ""Yay! I got it!""Lastly, take care when pulling them out. The little rubber ends are what provides good grip and keeps the roller close to the root, BUT if you just grab and yank, especially when wet, it grabs and yanks your hair too. Learned that lesson after sacrificing a small lock of hair.BUT don't let that scare you. Just learning curves I won't have to repeat and were totally worth the results! LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM!",5
"I love lip stains!  I can use them in the morning and am pretty much good to go the rest of the day.  I was so excited to try these, but I was a bit disappointed.  First of all, they are drying.  I must use a moisturizing lipstick over the top which defeats the purpose.  They are touted as a balm, but I see nothing soothing about them. Minty?  Hmmmm.....not so much.  The brighter colors do a little better as a stain; the paler shades are extremely light.  I bought 5 in a bundle so I have used a variety of shades.  I won't purchase these again.",3
"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. It has a wonderful ingredient list! Has a strong scent, but I kind of like it. Cooling & tingling sensation make it feel like it's working. Easy to use and will last quite a while",5
Love this makeup.  Great to put in your purse.  Colors are nice especially for brown eyes.,5
"I love RevitaVie! I'm 54 and I felt like the skin on my face and neck were being nourished. I've never used a Vitamin C serum before, and this felt wonderful on my skin. It also has a very lovely scent! I'm looking forward to having younger looking skin. :) Thanks, summer59",5
"LAVO Volcanic Mud Mask has the clean, natural scent of eucalyptus and sage and a delightfully silky texture that feels very pleasant when applied to the skin.  It can be used on the whole face for a spa experience and also used more frequently to treat just trouble spots.The mask is a taupe color in the jar and dries much lighter to a fine powder that is easy to rinse away.  It cleans, conditions, and moisturizes the skin, leaving it feeling soft and fresh and temporarily reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles.I always feel so pampered when using a facial mask and the quality of this one adds to that sensual experience.Ingredients:  Diatomaceous Earth, Fullers Earth, Kaolin, Glycerin, Aloe Vera Gel, Zinc Oxide, Sodium Alginate, Allantoin, Guar Gum, Sage Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate.LAVO provided a sample for evaluation and review.",5
"loved!! the way it made my extensions feel and it smells amazing, however i didnt notice a difference on my hair",3
Comes with a nice hemp bag and the brushes are outstanding! I've used animal hair brushes and this are so much better.,5
I love this silicone mat to place my iron curling on it. It's quit ok fr me but the shipping price is a little bit too high .,5
"This makeup remover smells very strongly of unpleasant chemicals that gives you the feeling of a rash just by smelling it. It also doesn't get eyeliner off very well and you have to scrub which obviously irritates and reddens your skin. If you get it in your eye it doesn't sting, so that's good. Also, the box can be reused. Allover, 3 stars!",3
"I purchased this curling iron to replace my 2 1/2 year old Hot Tools curling iron that had stopped doing a good job at curling my hair.  Based on my experience with Hot Tools products, they only last a short time before they stop working as well as they did when new.  I recently purchased a Babyliss flat iron which I'm pretty satisfied with, so I figured I'd give this curling iron a try.  First of all, it feels cheap because it's so light.  It feels like a drugstore curling iron in my hands.  Secondly, it has a much shorter barrel than my Hot Tools iron, by at least an inch or so.  Thirdly, I find the top part of the barrel to be too small.  This is the place you put your fingers when curling your hair.  Therefore, I've burnt myself several times and I'm sure I will continue to do so until I get used to it.  And lastly, I seriously have doubts that it heats up to 450 degrees.  My flat iron gets that hot and you can see the steam and feel the heat on my head when using it.  It just doesn't seem like this curling iron reaches that high of a temp when I compare it to my flat iron and based on the curl results I'm getting.  While it does do a much better job curling my hair than my old curling iron did, the curls don't have lasting strength, which is what I was really looking for and expected from this iron since it gets so hot.  Mind you, I do have very thick, coarse hair.  So this iron may work better for someone with fine or thinner hair.So compared to the Hot Tools curling irons, I'd recommend this product.  But there has to be better working and designed curling irons out there.",3
I wore this on top of my Givenchy foundation and it gives me a tad more coverage than my loose powder,5
"This eyeliner is so great! I have always used liquid eyeliners with a rubber tip, so I was glad this one also had a rubber tip and not a brush. I love the shape of the bottle and it's cool that you can set it down if you need to without risk of spilling it when applying your eyeliner. It is nice, dark, rich black. Very liquid-y, makes a nice smooth line. Dries after applying. Didn't smudge. Natural ingredients! Love, love, love it!",5
"this stuff does work , but needs to be combined with multiple scrubs and constant moisturising.",4
I have this lotion in my kitchen near the sink. I love it because it moisturizes and disinfects. This lotion is not greasy but it definitely keeps my hands moisturized.,5
"For the past month, I've been doing research for hours on end trying to find a better relaxer for women of color. One that is good for color treated hair, conditions, strengthens, helps breakage, and DOESN'T BURN.Previously, I've used lye relaxers such as Motions & Clairol Texture Tones. Both of them burned like hell. So I switched to no-lye ORS Olive Oil for a year then Optimum Anti-Breakage for a year.  The Olive Oil was ok but after the first couple weeks, my hair would be dry/hard.  The Optimum burned my edges and I didn't see any progress in strengthen or stopping my breakage.My choices were between Mizani Butter Blend Sensitive Scalp and Affirm Fiberguard.  I chose Mizani because it was the only one I could find in my local beauty supply store.  I was a little skeptical with ordering it online plus the shipping costs are outrageous.  The relaxer already costs a little more than the ones in the box.  However, I am TOTALLY HAPPY with the Mizani.  I love the way it makes my hair feel soft & light.  It got my hair straighter than expected based on other reviews I've read.  And most importantly IT DIDN'T BURN.  This relaxer doesn't come with the little neutralizing shampoos & conditioners like the box perms.  But it's not a big deal.  Plus I don't think it's necessary to use the Mizani Pre-Treatment/Shampoos/Conditioners.  They're a little too pricey to me.  I used ORS Olive Oil neutralizing shampoo with another brand conditioner & it worked out perfect.  Mizani will be my new relaxer from now on...",5
"I've tried Burt's Bees skin care products before, and have never been a fan of anything but their lip balms.  However, their Natural Acne Solutions line is really great and--the important thing--actually works.  I started out with just the moisturizer, and was happy enough with it to try the cleanser.  A few things:1. It is really more of a liquid than a gel.  It lathers up nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dried out.2. It smells kind of like lemon dish-soap to me.  Can't say I particularly like or dislike the smell, but it's not a selling point.3. The container is kind of a pain, especially compared to the moisturizer, which is so nicely packaged.  I might try putting some cleanser in a foaming pump dispenser and see if that works any better.  It's difficult to use the same amount of product every time since it kind of just pours out (and you really don't need much).I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  It is more even, less red and blotchy, and less prone to bumps/acne (after about 3 months of using this cleanser and about 4 months using the moisturizer).  Don't think this is a magical serum that will make your face completely acne-free (although maybe for some people it will have that effect).  I do still get acne occasionally, but this product along with the moisturizer have definitely improved the overall appearance of my skin, which is more than I can say for most products out there.  Most importantly, it doesn't dry out my skin and doesn't have that harsh chemical-feel of many other products.  Definitely give it a try if you're looking for a gentle cleanser to take care of blemished skin--I've found that this works quite well for me.",4
gentle yet effective and it smells refreshing.  I wish I had more for each shower.  You should suds up and try it.,5
"Ohhhhhhhh gosh, I was waiting for a reasonable priced makeup tool to give me the flawless foundation result that I was praying for and my prayers have been answered. This product makes any liquid foundation look perfect on me it is like my skin but enhanced in a very natural way. I will buy it again and again and again.",5
"I had forgotten I had this &#34;primer&#34; - it's probably been close to a year since I last used it.I see lots of reviews thinking this primer is fairly useless because it gets watery & separated after you have it for a while.  Yes, it does eventually separate - yuck!  Just run warm water over the container, for about 1/2 min to 1 minute.  Then shake the bottle and voila!  NO MORE SEPARATION!  It's back to perfection.I think it's kind of odd that it's considered a primer tho.  I use it more as a highlighter for my mature skin.  (Maybe it is a good primer, but it's nothing like the other brands I've used, which are thicker and seem to lay a better canvas for foundation.)I do love this product tho!  I use it simply to brighten different areas of face.  Eyes, chin, top of cheek bones, etc.  I just pat this on with my fingers AFTER foundation (I use the Real Techniques sponge to apply foundation - I find it to be the absolute best method for applying different types of foundation!)I love this as a highlighter!  It's not sparkly at all.  And the &#34;separating&#34; is super easy and quick to fix.",5
It works great worth every penny i spent on it and it cleans very fast with using only a small amount of product,5
"this is a good spoolie, but the one you can get at target is just as good and cheaper.  would recommend if you can't get at target",3
"I love OPI polish and ""A Rose by Dawn"" is my favorite color.  I wear it year round for both my manicures and pedicures.  It goes with everything I wear and I get lots of compliments on it, especially on the pedis.I brush on two coats, goes on smoothly, and then I top it off withOPI Nail Polish, Top Coat, 0.5-Ounce.  It's a great combination and usually lasts close to two weeks (unless I'm swimming a lot or cleaning a lot, with my hands in water for extended periods without rubber gloves).",5
"I brush this all over my skin before I take a shower. It makes my skin so smooth. This bristles are pretty scratchy, though, so if you have sensitive skin you might want to get a brush that's a little softer.",5
"I had high expectations for this mascara but I am really not impressed. Does not give my eye lashes extra volume like it says on the packaging. Just ok mascara, I will not but this again as there are much better options out there for the same price.",3
"This is a stunning hair ornament!  It's not too blingy, and the colors of the stones should look good on any hair color.  I'm too chicken to depend on it to hold all my hair (there's a lot of it), but it's gorgeous stabbed through a chignon or a messy bun.  It has enough texture that it won't fall out.  I love the dangly pieces.  So elegant",5
"This product is wonderful. I have been buying it through Amazon for about 6 months and tried it solely based on it's good reviews. I blow dry my hair every night before I go to bed, which dries out my hair from the shaft to the ends and leaves it frizzy. I have fine (thin) hair and put about a half dollar sized amount in my palm and rub it around to crate a thin film on my palms. I slide my palms on the inside and outside of my hair starting at my ear length and work it down to the ends which is a couple of inches below my shoulders. Magic - no more frizz and my hair feels like their is no product in it and is brushable. Also a little bit like a detangler too.",5
This is a great color. You need to put on at least two coats for it not to be transparent but it's a great color purple!,5
I loved this headband. It matched with everything.  It looked a little small but it did manage to fit around my big head so I'd recommend for adults or kids!,5
"I am always in search of a good sunscreen-- I have pale, sensitive skin and I react to a lot of the chemicals in most standard brands.  I not only burn after a few minutes in the sun, I often get an itchy rash (not because of sunscreens- the rash occurs when I don't wear any sunscreen). I really need a product that protects my skin from the sun-- but I hate the &#34;ghost white&#34; appearance that so many natural products create. So I hold out hope when I hear of a &#34;natural&#34; product that might finally work for me.  And, while this product is not perfect, it is doesn't cause the sensitivity issues that other products I've tried (Neutrogena, Coppertone, Aveeno, etc.).Good: Soaks in rather quickly so initial greasy feel goes away.  Funky color (whitish/gray) also soaks in and disappears.  And I just use some face powder over it which brings back some color and decreases the shine (of course that tip probably works better for women).  Doesn't cause irritation, itching, etc.  Seems to be good for sensitive skin. Offers good sun protection.Not-so-good:  You have to shake it first-- and even then you get oily residue out of the tube. Funky smell-- I'm thinking it might be the green tea (which is not a smell I like) but something makes it smell like musty pine. The funky color (again, I'm thinking the green tea...) is a turn-off, but, as I mentioned, does seem to dissipate after applying. I also wish the spf were higher than 30-- personally I do better with a higher level of protection.I'm going to keep using it and I am generally pleased so far.",4
"Smells good, the color was right on, not sticky like I read in some reviews, for me anyways. But it doesnt stay on long at all which is not a big deal to me. But probably wont but again",3
"Some might say a conditioner is just a conditioner...all the same. I disagree as I have used some that are just awesome and make my hair feel thicker as well as tone down brassiness. That said, this conditioner did nothing for my blonde hair and after using 3/4 of a bottle, I didn't notice any ""repair"" to speak of.  Nondescript.",3
"The product shipped out to me so fast! It arrived almost three weeks ahead of what was estimated so that was a pleasant surprise. The lashes themselves bend very well and feel very nice and soft. Still haven't had a chance to wear them out but I'm excited as they're fairly natural but still give a little oomph to lashes. For 10 pairs of this quality the price was pretty awesome!Only downside was the shipping method used. They came in a water-resistant package with padding so that was good, but I'm assuming through customs it got a little beat up so the box was a little crushed/ The lashes themselves were unscathed so I don't see it as a big deal.",5
"I have good things to say about this and bad. The good is, that you get a lot for a reasonable price and it's fresh and will last a long time. I don't know how it would fare on a hot summer truck though. The bad is, I have normal skin (not too oily and not too dry and it's just not very moisturizing. It absorbs right away and doesn't stay greasy but after it's absorbed my skin still feels tight and dry. For instance I just used it as hand lotion but my hands are crying out for lotion. They still feel dry. I used to use pure Shea butter on my face at night but tried this instead and my face was dry the next morning unlike soft and moisturized like Shea butter. I will mix this with my moisturizers and won't buy again. If your skin is oily, it might be perfect. It is said its good for acne prone skin and a hair treatment but it will weigh hair down if not shampooed after. Putting some on the ends is o.k.",3
"Great foundation. I have oily skin, but I don't have any problems with this makeup and I don't use powder either.  This foundation is oil free. It lasts all day. It gives very good coverage.  I've tried Revlon Colorstay.  It lasts all day, too, but it's a heavier feeling formula. It doesn't blend into the skin as easily as this one. This foundation lives up to it's ""super blendable"" name. Since it blends so well, it gives a very natural and smooth look to my skin...not masklike.  When wearing, I've gotten comments; ""your skin is beautiful"", instead of your make up looks nice.The cute, little, glass bottle reminds of of an old fashioned milk jug.  A little goes a long way. As the manufacturer stated; use four dots of foundation...forehead, cheek, cheek, and chin.  Covering the open bottle with the finger tip and giving a tilt of the wrist, leaves the perfect size dot on the finger tip. I use a makeup brush to blend.  Using most days, a bottle lasts me almost 3 months.Another thing I really like about this foundation, it doesn't transfer easily and it doesn't drip off my face with normal sweat in hot weather,(or hot flash).  It leaves no foundation ring around the collar.  The foundation I'd worn for years was discontinued. It's not so easy finding a new one. I'm glad I stumbled across this Loreal True Match. I like it better than the old.UPDATE; I'm still fond of this makeup, but I have to tell you, I have found even better.  To my surprise, it's Maybelline ""Super Stay 24hr""  Yeah!  It's wonderful; perfect color and glides over your skin like satin and blends right in, extremely well.  It must be formulated with an included primer. Very natural looking with great coverage. It formulated to not sweat off.  Well, I put some on and worked out, until I was dripping in sweat. As soon as I was done, I ran to the mirror. This foundation didn't budge. Absolutely, no dripping or streaks. I'm sold.I'm a Massage Therapist. My treating room is warmer than normal, to accommodate my client's lack of clothing. When I do deep or vigorous work, in no time, I'm sweating like a pig, but I like to use makeup.  I definitely look better with it.  This Maybelline ""Super Stay 24hr"" has everything I want; good coverage, natural looking,  perfect color, great formula, great feel on my skin, and sweat proof, too!  It comes in a tall cylinder bottle, with a white and silver cap.  Try it, if you find a color you like for your skintone.  I'm almost exactly the color of a brown paper bag. The Caramel works perfectly for me.  It's a little more expensive...about 13.",5
"Well I thought the product would be much bigger cause the box picture just makes me thing its huge. Guess I should of known 2oz is not much. The smell of the product I like, it smells like a field of flowers. Now I haven't seen anything different with my skin I'm not sure if my skin was already soft or what but I still like the product.",4
"I use Caress Body Wash a lot and like it.  It lathers well and a little goes a long way.  It rinses off well and doesn't dry out my skin. I enjoyed this new scent as well.  It's not overly flowerly, but smells very clean and refreshing.  It is strong so if you are sensitive to scents you might not like this, but the scent doesn't last for long either so I have no problem with it.",5
"The first time I used this, I thought my skin was burning, but this was just caused by the 'mint' in the product. Don't worry, it wasn't burning off. Once I got over the initial shock and discomfort I realized that this mask is by far the best I have ever used. I tend to have very large pores and while it didn't 'shrink' them as such, I did notice that my skin was much firmer and plumper. It was also exceptionally smooth. Since that first time I have used it many many times, and now that I know what to expect with the 'tingling' sensation, it is very enjoyable and refreshing especially in summer.",5
these were a gift to my daughter for Christmas. she is having so much fun making different designs on her nails!,5
I love a nice lip liner with gloss look. And I tried to achieve that with this. But I think I picked the wrong color for my skin tone.,1
Not sure what there is about this formula that messed with my allergies.  I have been allergic to eating Macadamia nuts in the past but didn't really think topically applying an oil of them would make me sneeze?  Other than that I liked how the formula rinsed out easily and left my hair manageable (almost to the point I think I could have skipped a conditioner).  If you have a nut (or nut oil) allergy than proceed with caution.  Otherwise it is a great product.Edited:  Changed stars to 4.  The product did a great job..it isn't the product's fault I am allergic to Macadamia nuts.,4
"I will admit that at first I was a little disappointed with this set. The clear box had no compartments and the cosmetics are just displayed against a silver cardboard.  Then I realized this is an excellent beginners set.  I have a niece who's Birthday is in mid-August who is 14 and very interested in real makeup.  So, I gave this to her for her birthday.  She is thrilled and has asked sister and female cousins for makeup tips.  This set is excellent to start a young lady out with quality makeup, instead of bargain bin junk.  Linda W.",5
"The variety of colors and shapes are fantastic and help the creative process!  The case is so much better than many in the circular cases, so much easier to keep them separate and secure.  Shipping was quick and packaged well.",5
THIS IS A 100 STAR PRODUCT IT MAKES MY EYELINER EXPIRENCE EASIER AND LESS MESSY. I USUALLY STYLE WITH A CAY EYE LOOK I LOVE IT I CAN MAKE THICK AND THIN EYE LINER LOOKS. BLACEST BLACK IS THE BEST SINCE I LOOK HAVING THAT DRAMATIC LOOK. LOVE THIS EYELINER. THE BEST EYELINER IVE BEEN USING IT FOR ONE YEAR NOW.,5
"Fancy is one of my favorite celebrity scents, and this set was very economical. It would make a welcome gift for any Fancy-lover you know.",5
"I have been using this eyeliner for years, it's great.  I love being able to order it off of amazon for a great price and get fast shipping, no more trips to the store",5
"I've bought several Sigma eyeshadow brushes and this is my favourite. It's a basic brush for laying down shadow on the lid.  What I like about it compared to other versions is that it is fairly small, with relatively short bristles, which gives me more control.  Excellent quality and synthetic (cruelty free).  For crease brushes, on the other hand, I have found Hourglass has the best.  For blending out existing shadows and just blurring the lines between colours I really like the fluffy, largest headed brush in the Real Techniques Basic Eye set (it's the only one I really like in that set, but it's so good it's worth the money and I'm not a really big RT fan.)  All of these use synthetic hair.  Beware the white haired eye brushes, which are often goat hair.  If you have allergies to horses like me, any hair from hoofed animals is risky.",5
"This is a brighter pink than the picture indicates.  It is not a coral color, but rather a brighter pink color.  The application is a bit dusty and can go on heavy if you don't blow on the brush ahead of time.  If you're careful, it provides a lovely color.",5
"Works ok.  Too light weight, makes it hard to hold and use.  Awkward.  I will not be buying this again.  Just don't like the design.",2
"This stuff doesn't lather well at all and my scalp did not feel clean. To be fair, I've found that with other organic shampoos too. Their conditioner is very very good but skip the shampoo. The scent is nice.",1
This headband is very cute but mine fell apart the first day I up it on. I plan to re glue it myself or maybe sew it so that never comes apart again.,2
This is my second bottle. I felt some difference on my face. It's a little tighten now. It just that tends to dry my skin. But the price is excellent. I also add this to my other serums and creams I use in my beauty regime .,5
"I am a fan of clay masks because they make my skin feel soft, smooth, and &#34;detoxed.&#34;  The clay masks I have used in the past, however, were pre-formulated in a tube which seems to only work great for the first or second time that you use the tube.  Then, suddenly, the tube gets harder and harder to squeeze the product out; making your purchase both frustrating and a waste of money.  This is not the case with Best Bentonite Clay as use mix JUST WHAT YOU NEED AT THE TIME, and the rest of the powdered clay stays fresh for you to use in the future.  You mix the powdered clay with water and apply - simple as that. Don't be fooled by the size of the jar - this will last you a long, long time as you don't need much powder per mask.  It feels refreshing and great to use - feels like I'm treating myself to something special.  I definitely recommend this product.  The value is incredible if you compare this to the price of the pre-mixed Murad clay mask product - you will be glad that you bought Best Bentonite Clay instead!",5
"I personally think these are a wonderful asset to use in removing your shellac polish. I had very little problem using them, and had husband help me with my BaD hand. I highly recommend them, due to the less mess, and ease in getting off the polish. Just take some time, and really learn how to use them proper. All good things are worth the extra little few seconds to get the right effect. I think they are great for removing the shellac polish.",5
"I really like the way this smells.  It has tea tree oil in it, but it's not strong smelling.  I like tea tree oil in my shampoo because it really helps repel any lice and sometimes I am around kids that get it.  I've been putting a few drops in my shampoo for a long time and have never had a problem so far.  This shampoo has rich lather, and it feels very luxurious.  It cleans well.  It really only have problems with dandruff after I color my hair, and it has kept this from happening so I am pleased with that.  I would continue to use it the week after I color.  I didn't particularly notice any difference in fullness though, and it seemed to be a tad drying, so I probably would not use it every day on my long hair.  I do love the smell though - it's not sex specific - it doesn't smell 'like a man' or 'like a woman' - it's just a good natural clean smell.",4
"It says on the bottle to use in conjunction with the Hair Growth Oil.  Maybe it is just my head, but I do not have a naturally oily head.  I found, though, when I used both products together (sparingly) after my hair dried it was still oily.  It is still too early to detect growth and it is improving my texture I just wish since it says daily, I could actually use it daily without my hair being oily.  I am going to try to use even less than what I was using previously.  Still buy this product, though, just be careful with the amount you use because it is still a good product and it does work.",3
"The only soap I use for sensitive skin.  It has a pleasant smell and washes clean off your skin, no residue.  I've used this soap for 8 years now.",5
"There's not a whole lot to say, it works and I like it.I take off one star because the mini buffer, when is that ever useful?  My nails certainly aren't that small and it just sits in a corner collecting dust.",4
"I can't believe i have had this product for a year now, and didn't leave feedback until just now.I really love the Shrimply Divine color!!! (since i love pink lol) The color lasted long, You do have to put in a second coat ifyou don't want to see your natural nail. But it lasted long. I will buy again!",4
"I get more compliments on this color than any other I have worn. It is elegant, understated but a little bold. Clean and professional looking but not boring. I put a little &#34;Vegas Nights&#34; sparkle on top sometimes, and it is a classy, not gaudy look. Love it!",5
"I bought this for the stamper and It is a very good stamper, but I don't use the scraper because it is metal and will scratch my plates. I am glad I ordered it!",4
"UPDATE: JUNE 2012:.  Although the product has a 4 year warranty, it died after less than 1 1/2 years.It is used A LOT, almost every day by 1 to 3 of our daughters, so it is heavily used.  I contacted Rayovac, who told me to ship it back for a new replacement.  I shipped it to Rayovac/Spectrum Brands for about $7 on 6/4.  Spectrum received the returned item on 6/7. A new replacement was received on 6/18.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe Remington S9520 Hair Straightener, also known as the T Studio Pearl model, is a very nice quality product with a great price point.The ceramic plates are advertised as infused with real pearl.  I don't know how much, if any, difference this makes in performance, or how much pearl content the plates contain.  What I do know if at 2"" wide, the plates are a great width and will help you get through the straightening process a bit more quickly.  Also, the plates are nice and smooth so hair glides gently through.The unit heats up to a ""pro quality"" 450 degrees and gets there quickly.  Advertised at taking only 15 seconds to achieve this temperature, its readout did indicate 450 degrees in about 15 seconds.  While not entirely scientific, I did put it to the test by a high heat thermometer in the unit and turning on the S9520.  It did reach a true 450 degrees in about 30-60 seconds or so each time I tried it.  Perhaps not 15 seconds, but in that quarter of a minute it was well on its way.  I would say it is absolutely ready to use in 15-20 seconds, but if you expect a true 450 degrees, plan on more like a half minute to a minute - this should not be a big deal for anyone.  When it reaches the desired temperature, the unit beeps to alert you.  The temp settinsg are 1 bar for 300-340 degrees, 2 bars for 360-400, and 3 bars for 420 to 450 degrees.  The display is blue and is easy to read in light and dark.The controls are well placed and simple to use.  They include the power, the temperature and the temperature lock.  As far as adjusting the temperature, the unit defaults to 450 degrees so take note and lower the temperature if you want a lower setting.  There is also a ""turbo"" feature to allow you to kick up the temperature on the fly. The product appears to be of quality construction and includes a swivel cord, which is nice for avoiding twisting the cord or placing stress on it.  Naturally, you want to avoid wrapping the cord around the unit for storage, particularly because of  the heat involved.The unit also includes a 60 minute auto-shutoff to avoid accidents.  Please note, as with many products of this type which heat to a high temperature, the handle will feel warm, and may be hot the closer you get to the plates.If you travel a lot, this product handles 120 and 240 voltage.Overall, this product performs very well.  It does what it says and does it well.Remington backs this product with a four year warranty, which in my experience is not common for a small personal appliance.  Most warranties seem to be 1, maybe 2 years, and sometimes 90 days for cheap products.  The warranty comes through Spectrum Brands.  Don't be alarmed.  This is a Remington product.  Spectrum owns the Remington line, following Rayovac's acquisition of Remington Products in 2003 (Rayovac changed their name to Spectrum Brands in 2005).",4
Gorgeous color and attractive love these colors so much that the color much seems clear and distinct...This beautiful shadowsThank you,5
"I don't use this as my main primer but I do use it as a shadow base for eye shadows that I want to pop! This will also help with those eye shadows that tend to have a bit of fall out. The sticky base helps the shadow to stick better. I love it, for the price you pay you can't go wrong.",5
Love this brush and what a great deal! I switch between this and a beauty blender and both I have to say work amazing but I've been favoring this brush lately. Great for stippling and blending and it's really soft like those more expensive brushes.,5
"After using some Manic Panic red, the color only lasted a few days. As soon as I washed it I had half red half pink hair. After washing it and washing it with dish soap I finally had a gross shade of pink left in the root and blonde ends. I had a wedding to go to and my hair was just not in acceptable condition. So I ordered a bottle of SFX Atomic Pink. I didnt want to go for a super dramatic color so I SERIOUSLY diluted the dye with conditioner. I used only a little tiny squirt to achieve a very cute cotton candy pink. Its been a few months of washing and now it has faded to a super cute baby pink! This stuff STICKS!",5
"This product smells AH-MAZING.  It makes my hair a little bit thicker but it definitely isn't a miracle.  I like it and it cleans my hair.  So far it seems like the shampoo gives a lot of volume to my hair, without making my curls go limp or super frizzy.  The bottle is a good size and I would totally repurchase this.",4
"I was looking for a sensitive skin foaming face wash. This item is good for sensitive skin, however it doesn't foam very much and I didn't feel that it cleaned my face well. I wouldn't buy it again.",1
"This was a nice, bright white for my Gelish French Manicure.  A little easier to use than another white I had from Gelish.",4
I purchased one of these about a year ago in store and it has become my most used tool other than a nail file. I have a similar tool from another brand but find the scraper too rough for fingernails thus it has been resigned to my pedicure kit. The shape of the scraper on this is better suited to getting the tough bits released from the side of the nail where the cuticle curves up. So glad to see it on amazon now i can have one for my purse as well! Another plus is that its easy to sanitize so its safe to share if you have to.,5
I was impressed with how quickly this flat iron heated up but that's about it. I have thick wavy hair and it didn't do a very good job of straitening. I have another straightener that gets my hair perfectly straight right away (and it was cheaper than this one).,3
"These are SUPER fun!  The only hard part is finding a polish thick enough to go in the tiny crevices and get an image with just one coat.  I've done some pretty great mani / Pedi's with these, though.  Comes with some strange image options, but a lot of usable ones. Super glad I bought it.",4
"Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!",1
Drawing perfect lines on my clients have never been one of my stronger qualities.  Even less so when it comes to my own hands working on themselves.  These have made my polishing time much faster and the look is exceptional!  Not to mention the price was perfect.,5
I wore this and I could not believe how many people wanted to hug me and the commits they gave me you have to try this and lasts a long time too,5
"this is it, when its gone its gone, there is no roller it is like a one week supply for the money it should last longer.",1
This brush set is soft and easy to handle.  I decided to share a couple with my sixteen year old granddaughter and she is loving them.,5
"I saw my friend using this brand of false eyelashes which looked so natural on her so I wanted to give them a try. Personally they're too long for me so what I do is, I slip off a couple lashes and stick them individually to my lash line which looks so much more natural.",3
The product is of the highest quality and I loved trying it out.I am going to share this with my older family members as well because I like it so much. The cool texture and feel on my skin is very relaxing and it did not cause any skin reaction.,5
"The only reason why I took one star off is because it is a bit pricey in my opinion. However, it handles everything I look for: slip, botanicals, softness, shine, great smell, moisture. It handles my thick, dry hair with no problem. I have been on a run of trying other products but I think I might go back to this, because aside from the price, I have nothing to complain about. I really feel like I stepped out of the salon with this product.",4
"Yeah, fluffy. Texture and claims, both.It's fine. I'm a little on the drier side, so I'm not inclined to use this without a serum. By the same token, though it's not too moist feeling, I don't find myself thinking I'm dry.I feel like I'm going through my jar more quickly than I go through other things.It's an absolutely serviceable moisturizing cream that I would use again, but there's so many other things out there that have wowed me more.The name amuses me because years ago that's exactly the phrase I would use in explaining that I sold beauty products. I should have copyrighted before philosophy did.",3
"Very moisturizing.  I live in the desert and never thought I would find an effective daily moiturizer.  Well people, this works.",5
"So far I've used it every day and my skin is looking better, but I think I need to use it for a month or so to be sure.  I've taken before and after pix, and that will tell.",4
It really helps and I also really like the smell of it! I would suggest this to anyone who wants to keep their cuticles strong and smooth!,5
These black label lipsticks are awesome. So moisturizing and the pigment is so good! Dusty Rose is such a gorgeous color for me (I'm an NC 35/40). And it is so similar to Maybelline's Limited Edition Lipstick in Afternoon Tea (which is one of my faves that I ran out of)and Dusty Rose is the dupe for it which makes me so happy! Try these! They are great!,4
"I have very thin skin, especially under my eyes, so I found this formula a little too thick for using as an under-eye concealer.  I love it, however, for hiding bruises and discolorations on other areas of my face, arms and legs. I have a small area of discoloration on my shin that shows through my stockings and makes me very self conscious. I have tried numerous concealers on this area and never found one I liked until I tried Watts. It makes it completely disappear and does not come off until I use soap and water. An added benefit is that Watts' concealer is very gentle and doesn't irritate my skin :)",5
"This palette is awesome. It's super bright, and you can create and have so many different fun looks with it! 72 colors to pick from is pretty awesome!",5
"I am obsessed with this stuff! It really is dry to touch in 30 seconds, but I like to give it a full 2 or 3 minutes before doing anything. I never want to be without this topcoat.",5
"It keeps my hair &#34;down&#34; in front and up in the back. It is very tacky and must be used sparingly to avoid a gummed up feel to the hair, but the lay down power of this gel is outstanding. If it can keep my wild crazy hair slick, it is a perfect answer to frizzy edges.",5
"After showering with this body wash your skin feels like silk.  Truly has the moisturizing effect as mentioned.  Love it, plan on continuing using this body wash.",5
I've been using this for over a month and I see nothing different. I don't know if it's my complexion or just me. It may not be for black people. But I would not buy this not do I care for it. It's also sticky and the smell could be better.,2
This is an awesome color! I love the name too! Use this one with the silver additive. It is beautiful.,5
"Add a little color and style to your bathroom with GHD's lemon-yellow 1-inch professional styler. Teens will especially like this heating iron for either curling or flattening. The styler uses ceramic for even heating. This limited edition candy collection will be a hit with any young woman who prefers bright colors. The iron has a sleep mode for safety. When it hasn't been used for 30 minutes, it will automatically shut off.",5
The colors are great but the polish isn't very functional. Some require 3 or more coats to achieve an even look. The four I've tried chipped very quickly. There's a reason the price is so low.,3
I've been using Biore strips for years and recommended these for my son; I use the Ultra version and those tend to be a little too strong for him. We both can see a big difference in his pores when he uses these. I think we both really get about the same results because he's able to use these more often.Pleased with this product and highly recommended.,4
These brushes are very soft and high quality. Comes with a nice selection and a cute case. Good price too.,5
I love that this product buffs really good and leaves a soft finish like it should be :-) will buy again,5
"I wanted teal blue and this is exactly that.  I haven't worn this color yet because I think it would look better during warmer weather.  In the cold, I'm wearing a darker blue.  I like this color.  It's attractive.  I look forward to wearing it.As with other Gelish polishes, I'm sure the quality is great.",4
"I've been using this shampoo in conjunction with the youth renewal conditioner and have gotten excellent results from both in terms of enhancing color brightness and shine in my aging hair. It's a sad fact that the texture and color of hair degrade as you get older (I'm nearly 50) and I've really noticed the changes over the past 8 years or so. I didn't believe that shampoo or conditioner really made a difference, but they really do. While I'll never have the hair I had in my 20's, I can at least make it look better than it did while using Dove or other cheap shampoos and conditioners.The shampoo itself is pretty potent when you later it up. In fact, a little seems to go a long way. The only drawback to this shampoo in my experience is that it doesn't get my scalp as clean as others. I usually shampoo twice a week (and condition every day), but I find that I need to do it three times a week with this shampoo. Even working hard to reach my scalp, it still doesn't seem to get as clean. That doesn't make it a bad product at all. In fact, I think the benefits to aging hair outweigh the deficits, but it is something to keep in mind in terms of the cost/benefit ratio.",4
"I bought this for my daughter who has acne. She has tried a lot of products and this one has worked better then any of the others. She uses it every night before she goes to bed. She gets bad breakouts when it's that time of the month but once she started using this product her face didn't break out at all. I'm going to order some for my son as well. If you have a problem with acne I recommend giving this a try. Also, the price is really good. So, what do you have to lose?",5
"I should give it 3 stars for being in expensive but it just stays on my skin. After shower I have to wait 20 min before I can put clothes on, it creams on top of your skin,Almost as if it is not getting absorbed. I have a white paste on my skin when I use it:(For me it was a waste of money, I will use on my hands and may be feet till its gone. Wont buy again.",1
"This eyeliner is very easy to put on. I can clean up my line with a damp q-tip with speed and ease. It's also easy to remove. No tugging to get it off or raccoon eyes the next morning. My eyes are very sensitive, and I've had no problem with this eyeliner.",5
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;sigh>  I don't like giving one star reviews.  But this item sits among the worst of things I've come across.  It was falling apart from the moment I got it out of the bag - pumice stone fell out.  Putting it back in as best I could, it worked until I first attempted to use it, upon which the adhesive holding the stone to the plate which holds to the flexible body of the scrubber (can you see the flaw in this design?) let go and forever released to the stone into the wild.  Though the Scrubber has 18 small suction cups on the bottom, they are too shallow to get a real grip on the floor of my shower.  They utterly fail to hold the Scrubber in place.  Nice try BelleSha, but no one should buy this product.",1
I was looking for a non harsh facial cleanser and someone recommended Ponds cold cream.  Since I knew this would be part of my daily regimen I purchased the three pack.  Great price and great product.,5
This base coat really works! It helps my nail polish stay on a lot longer than if i had not applied a bottom coat. Love it!!,5
"This is just like the ones they use in the salon.  At first I thought it was really big, but then I realized if I put it on the floor I could do a shellac pedicure.  Both my feet fit comfortably inside.  I am a size 10 US women's.  great buy i have recommended this to others.",5
"I've tried a lot of these exfoliating cleansers. This one from Pond's is OK, although there are better ones out there.Pros:I really like the texture of this stuff. It's nice and creamy and doesn't feel sticky.The fragrance is fine and not overpowering. I generally prefer fragrance-fee products, but they are hard to find so this one is at least unobtrusive.Cons:The product isn't coarse enough to do a decent job of exfoliating. For some people with very sensitive skin, this might be enough, particularly for the face, but it just doesn't cut it for average skin.The little ""pearls"" that do the work of exfoliation are apparently made of plastic, although I can't tell for sure which type ofplastic because the ingredients listed on the package are incomprehensible. Suffice to say that they are mostly petroleum-basedchemicals. These get into the water system and become pollutants, which is why I try to avoid products like this.The label omits any mention of animal testing, so I have to assume that they do test this product on animals, which is another reason to avoid it.Alternative:A better choice of an exfoliating cleanser is St. Ives Apricot Scrub, which uses walnut hulls to provide a pleasingly coarse texture and is not tested on animals.",3
I love this moisturizer.  It gives the perfect finish without looking too shiny or too dry.  The texture is more a gel than a cream or lotion and feels great when you put it on your skin.  The smell is neutral and not overpowering at all. However the price has kept me from ordering more when I can find similar drugstore products at a much better price.,5
"I like this better than my old dryer, it is much lighter and has just as much or more power. Very nice.",5
"I am a very loyal St. Ives customer. I love and have loved every product that I've used of thiers. This product makes my skin so incredibly soft it took me by surprise! I didn't realize the size of the tub that I was purchasing, but there is a lot here and I use it twice daily. Will I purchase this again, absolutely!",5
Darker than appears on picture. A little goes a LONG way!! As long as you lock the product in with a powder it will stay for a while. Very glittery. I use it for contouring and in the summer the shimmer to the product looks amazing!!,3
Very disappointed with this product. I was so excited to try it after reading so many great reviews & I honestly don't understand how people like it. It's very waxy and goes on very roughly. Almost hurts a little to be honest! Takes a long time to make look natural because of how hard it is to apply. Definitely sticking to Benefit's brow pencil.,2
I love Essie. This color is amazing. It lasts longer and dries. Pretty fast. Worth the few extra bucks that you pay.,5
"Revlon doesn't disappoint!  This nail color makes my nails look like shiny pearls.  I only bought this because I found it on clearance, but it turned out to be one of my favorites this summer.  I have the usual compliments to Revlon on this one - it goes on great in two coats, holds up well (no chips after wearing it several days) and it is shiny without a top coat.  I have added Revlon to my favorite brands of nail polish and would highly recommend it.",5
I tried using this thing but it just didn't work right.  A pair of tweezers worked better.  Not worth the money.,1
"This is one of my favorite perfumes. I decided to buy my first perfume from Amazon, and it was a great idea. I saved money and time! The wet smell of this perfume is completely different than the dry down. Make sure you try this before you purchase it. I thought that I wanted the toilette, but when I compared them, I loved the parfum!! This is slightly musky, but still very feminine.",5
I am really happy with this product.  It works well in-between dyes.  I would recommend it to others.  It helps if you blow dry the hair to keep the color fast.,5
"I wish they can improve the packaging to make it a little bit more elegant. Other than that, the product is fantastic..",5
"The moisturing creams (Day and Night) are a great disappointment to be honest they are a GREAT GREAT DISAPPOINTMENt.  I have been using it for at least 6 weeks (thought I give it enough time before I judged it fairly)not seen any improvement. What a waste of time and money.  Also can't send it back unless not used.  Didn't see that one coming.  Should have know if I can't try first, clear sign to ""HURRY UP AND SEND IT BACK""",1
"These cleansing pads are oversized and wonderful, I no longer use two or more pads when applying astringent and other facial products. These pads do not shed, pull apart or litter your skin with bits of cotton. They are fantastic and they are made in America.",5
"I HATE using sunscreem.  Positively hate it!  It feels and smells gross and makes my skin break out, but I absolutely had to start using it recently because of another skin product I began using, so I decided to give the Eucerin Protective Lotion a whirl.The Eucerin is by far the best sunscreen/-block I have found. I've tried Neutrogena and countless other mineral/sensitive skin sunscreens, and hated them all, but the Eucerin disappears on my skin better than most mineral sunblocks, has very little odor, and has caused no break outs, even during exercise.  I think it does a decent job of moisturizing when used on its own, but I do usually mix it with my  day cream, which probably reduces its SPF a bit, but it's not been a problem, and I'm really happy with the product.",5
"This is a great product for the price. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. It came way earlier than expected, and I was satisfied.",5
"As mentioned by a previous reviewer, it is actually &#34;Pro-Mend&#34; heat protectant.  But I like it, the spritz is a full cloud of tiny mist, which is nice and covers a lot.  It's true, spraying too much will make it a bit sticky.  Smells very light for just a moment.I'm no expert on this stuff, but it seems fine to me.  I would ask, how would I know if it's working or not??  I just spray on before heat, and hope for the best.",4
"I have not used this for myself, but I know a couple of people who take it and they seem to be happy with it. It's good for hair, skin, and nails I think. Both people I know are taking it mainly for their hair, for balding.",4
"I almost never hate a product, but this is the worst excuse for eyeliner ever. The application process is good, but it rubs off so easily you would have to apply and re-apply all day long and who wants to re-apply eyeliner all day long. Over all if I could send this product back I would. L'Oreal has got some explaining to do with this one...smh",1
"First day i used this product  i thought i was going to hate it. Left my skin really oily and i felt it didn't really absorbed in my skin.Next day i had a extremely different experience, I used way less product like 4  less drops lol and used it a few minutes after i got out the shower . The difference was night and day, my skin didn't  felt excessively oily anymore but instead really moisturised.Also the smell of this product is not as bad as everyone is made it to be,  it disappears when you apply  it on your face.  When I opened the product i was expecting way worse.  Maybe it will bother you if you're sensitive to smells.Final thoughts, Healed my sunburn in a couple of days,  Comes in a huge bottle, and if this  heals sun damaged skin on my face as good as it did to the sunburn on my arm  then i can't wait to see the results on my face couple months using this 5 stars.",5
I have always washed my hair daily but recently my hair dresser has told me that it's actually healthier for your hair to wash it less often (as in every other day or so) because the natural oils are beneficial to it. I hated how my hair would feel on day two and always just brushed off her suggestion until I came across this dry shampoo that is meant for brunettes. My hair is dark brown and regular dry shampoo leaves a light powdery look while this dry shampoo has a dark color that blends nicely. My only suggestion is to make sure that your hair does not fall on your face after using this dry shampoo until you are sure that it has dried completely because it will leave dark marks on your face. Overall I think this is a great product and I plan on buying it again when my bottle runs out.,5
"I've been using Cure for less than a week and I'm totally hooked. After switching from Proactiv face wash to bio sulfur soap, I needed something to slough away the dead skin cells. This stuff does it and SOOO gently, without the irritation (my skin is pale and sensitive and reacts negatively to scrubs, making my skin really red). On the bottle, it says to use it twice a week, but since it's so gentle, I'm able to use it almost everyday with wonderful results. My skin is smoother and I'm able to remove that gross dead layer of skin that builds up daily (especially when using acne products). It's definitely cool to see the little beads of dead skin form on your skin as you're rubbing it in. I've been using it on the back of my hands (where the skin has seemed to become extra dry and wrinkly lately) and on my neck and it does WONDERS - my skin in those areas feels so much younger, just after a few uses. I'm 30 and I think I purchased this at the perfect time, allowing me to take extra care of my skin as I age. The price is worth it for me (especially since I was spending big bucks on Proactiv, which makes my skin red and doesn't completely clear up acne for me - ugh). I don't believe Cure will clear up acne, but it works so very well following on a face wash made especially for acne prone skin. I've been using Bio Sulfur Soap by Grisi and it's great. This stuff will work well on any skin type - in conjunction with any skin care routine. I'm so happy with this stuff!! Addicted!!Update: After reading more reviews of Cure on here, I've noticed that some people are saying that the little white or grey-ish (whatever color) beads that show up on your face after rubbing the product in, are just product build up. Well, that's bull crap. I love this stuff, and I KNOW that it's working and sloughing off dead skin cells. How do I know? When I use it once per week, a lot of dead skin cells come off. I've tried using it two times in a row (back to back) and the second time, barely any beads form at all. Sometimes...nothing. It'll be just like rubbing water into your skin. This is because it's actually ridding your face of dead skin cells the first time. I recommend this exfoliation treatment for anyone. Like I've said before, I have sensitive skin and it works great. No redness. No irritation. Just smoother, exfoliated skin.",5
I love it & look forward to buying more. Smells sooo good!! As expected of Jessica Simpson. lol :) And you get a nice size bottle for a great price. I will be buying more when i start running out! Just buy it i'm telling you you wont be disapointed.,5
Really works great! I use it in combination with my prescription medication and it keeps my face oil free and blemish free!,5
"Traditionally, AXE has had cologne scented products, but recently the Lever company has added natural scents to the line, such as Deep Space, which has a very herbal/rosemary type scent. When I first smelled Harmony, my first thought was that it smelled like Pine. After using the product for a while and smelling it closely, I would say it has a strong cedar fragrance with a touch of crystalized orange. I didn't instantly fall in love with this scent, but it provides great deodorizing action and fragrance for tough areas like armpits. Unlike ""Deep Space"", Harmony doesn't have any gritty beads, so it's gentle on the skin.With that said, AXE should really list the fragrances on their bottles. They like to use cool names, but what fragrance is a snake peel or Harmony, if you aren't familiar with the product line. I do think Axe should continue to use clear bottles, so you can see the cool colors of their gels.Like the other AXE body gels, Harmony has a strong scent, has a thick quality gel that lathers really good, and is an excellent value in size and price.",5
Bought this for my mother to use with the Derma Roller I got her also. I definitely recommend. Being as its natural & organic it didn't burn her face when she put it on. LOVE the consistency & feeling of it.,5
I just started getting used to wearing blushes after I discovered the contour of my cheeks. These are great colors and compliment any skin tone. Use them lighter or darker depending on what you want.,5
"..But still too soon to say I love it.  There has never been a makeup product that I've bought more than once so that's saying a lot.  I originally bought a bottle of Combination/Oily Caramel about a year ago and I couldn't believe the match being so spot on.  I'd never worn foundation before then, I'd always buy some, MAC, Make Up Forever, Dior, etc. They made me look extremely dull and a bit sick/sullen so I'd end up throwing them away after a year or too of them hanging out, completely useless in my bathroom.  The only one I didn't mind was Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer although it felt a bit grimy on my face.  This product feels like I have nothing on whatsoever and it's totally warmed my face up.  Now I look healthy and vibrant.  My daughter, however tried it on for fun and her undertone is way too peachy for it.  My yellow undertone is perfect.  The first bottle I bought broke after a few uses so I went out a few days ago, looking for Maybelline Matte Mousse, but decided that I shouldn't mess around with anything else, Thank God I trusted my gut.Lightweight, perfect healthy-looking coverage, comfortable price point.I'm just wondering why the same Caramel for Combo/Oily skin and the Caramel for Dry skin look so drastically different.  Thank goodness this formula is not drying on my skin.  Great product.",4
"yet it works in some ways but fails in others. It is a perfect means of exfoliating as it massages away the dead skin leaving the face soft and tingly clean. The problem though is my skin doesn't seem to react well to the chemicals in the formula. I'm an oxy-pruduct user which really keeps black heads and pimples non existent so the moment I stopped my blackheads incresed yet my complexion improved. I guess I'll have to stick with my ""Oxy"" but use the clean & Clear occassionally. Also the fact that they include the battery in the kit is impressive...(no one does that anymore). Overall I think it's a good product. People's skin type vary.",3
"I love this dry shampoo! I usually use it if I want to go an extra day without washing my hair, it also keeps my hairdo in place. The only thing I was surprised about was that it was empty after about 2 months and I only used about once a week. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be, but it caught me off-guard.",4
"Its too soon to do a full product review but the shipping was extra fast.  The only suggestion I would make is to take the big white upc sticker attached to the actual bottle off.  When I took it off it made it sticky. Once I use this for a month, I'll post a full review.",4
"I purchased the Ivory to Fair color. I wanted to try this because I am very fair and I have a hard time finding things that are light enough for my skin, so I wanted sheer coverage. This product also has anti-aging ingredients and broad spectrum UVA and UVB in spf 30, which is important for maintaining healthy skin and preventing aging and dark spots. When I apply this product(after toner, serum, and moisturizer), some of the product pills off, and some absorbs. I can only put so much on without there being a weird texture that does not look natural, so I wonder if I am really getting spf 30. The other main issue is that ivory to fair is WAAAAAY too dark and orange for very light skinned people. I could tell that the color in the package was a little bit too beige for my skin, but after applying it oxidizes to a orangey brown color. I have to blend all of the way down my neck to not have a demarcation, but even then I can tell that my skin is a little less than it's usual porcelain. Not enough of a problem for me to not use it, because I don't want to dish out for a more expensive product just yet, but I certainly will not repurchase. If you have fair skin, it will work, but for very fair or porcelain, you may want to pass. Also, store this in the dark to slow the breakdown of the antiaging ingredients.",3
"i have trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling) and experienced almost instant relief from this product. the nagging, itchy, burning feeling on my scalp went away and with it the urge to pull. i am hoping continued use of this product will help me keep my hair. so far, this is the most promising product i have ever found. (got it at whole foods)",5
"I thought this facial lotion would be more moisturizing based on the descriptions, but I wasn't really happy with it. I'll probably try it again for the summertime, but it wasn't enough to keep my face from drying out in the winter.",3
"I am a self proclaimed beauty product addict and connoisseur. This product is super emollient and beautifully priced. The winter months has caused me to modify my skin regime.  Lucky magazine recommended this product and I have to admit they did not fall short. Embryolisse was emollient, non greasy and silky. I even luv the smell.",5
"Very nice feeling lotion.  In fact,  my ex husband took it when we separated and he's tried many types of lotions for dry skin.",5
First time purchasing the raw form. I used it after a shower and my skin stayed moisturized. Consider mixing it with olive oil and using a mixer to blend. Makes it easier to apply to large areas.,5
My husband has been using this for a while and says he likes it pretty good.  The first time he used it he squirted out too much and now uses a blob about the size of your finger-tip.  He says it smears well and does what a shave gel is supposed to do.  I think it smells nice and I am very sensitive to perfumes. It does not have a loud perfume scent and I could barely notice it on him.,5
This is not only good on the lashes and looks really natural but also the black brown color is good for covering those fly away grays that pop up over night at the roots ;),5
"Real glue! and even though the color is like blue, when it dries it goes to color black. Really nice product and a strong adhesive. Though like any other adhesive, it tickles your eyes. Well, we all have different methods to cope with that. Also it comes with a handy pick (?) You can use it to fix your fake eyelash while applying it!",4
"Motions Moisturizing Cleanser does precisely what it claims to do. It cleans your hair, while also hydrating it, without the need to use a conditioner. It leaves your hair shiny and healthy. It doesn't weigh your hair down, but cleanses and conditions well.Featuring shea butter, coconut and avocado oils, it has a pleasant fragrance. My wife, in particular, really likes the product and has been using it on her permed hair and she likes the way the product cleans and leaves her hair feeling moisturized. She highly recommends it. ""It's the first conditioning shampoo that you can use without having to use a conditioner anyway,"" she said.",5
"You must try this lotion. It smells good and will leave your skin glowing. It seems edible. If you are a bride, then surely you want to place this on your skin on your wedding day and more.",5
"Nice Blue, I also have the red, the gold, the green, all four work nicely.  I love the look, they are beautiful.",5
"I use this for my hair loss.  This is the nourishing treatment.  The clinically proven ingredient that helps regrow hair is ketaconazole.  It's not in this product.  I accidentally keep ordering the nourishing treatment.  If I were you, I would skip the nourishing treatment and just purchase the Ketaconazole shampoo.  It's marked with a &#34;DR&#34; as opposed to a &#34;NT&#34;.",5
This is seriously an amazing product. I use it 1x-2x a week along with Organic Apple Cider (which I also ordered off Amazon). I've been moving towards more organic products and this is one of the best for deep clean clay masks.,5
"I didn't realize there were a bunch of different shapes, I thought it was all just flat circle rhinestones. But it's actually kind of nice that you can use different shapes",3
This really take off all the dead skin. Smoootthhh skin is such a nice feeling! Wasn't sure it would be as good as more expensive products but it truly trumps it!,5
"What can I say but AMAZING.  I love the feel, the smell, I get customers standing next to me at work and say I love the smell of your hair.  Makes it silky shiny.",5
"As the name implies, this hair dryer is faster than average. It has ionic tourmaline ceramic to enhance drying speed. It is not red but a deep, darker pink...like cherry Pepto Bismol :)... It is just a little heavier than average so if you have long, thick hair you may have to arrange some kind of stand for the dryer for part of your drying time to avoid wrist fatigue.  The 1875 watts may be a problem in older dwellings which haven't been updated for modern electric needs... but not for the majority. We found it to be an excellent product.

"So i got this steamer for my house so that i can lay in bed while steaming my face or giving friends or family a facial. This steamer is so powerful!!! more steam comes out than some places that ive recieved professional facials from.Very easy to assemble, The directions were not that great but u do need a rench to screw the pole into the black floor piece. The pole goes up and down so the fact that the nozzle does not move is not an issue to me at all. Only annoying things as other reviewers mentioned is that stupid alarm!!! i wish there was a way to lower it or turn it off. but other than that I am very pleased with with purchase. Oh yeah and i have natural 4c hair and didnt want to buy a hair steamer so i just aim the steam onto my head and it works great!",4
"This was absolute garbage. $7.00 garbage, not to mention. The product certainly didn't live up to its promises. It promises fuller lashes, without clumps. For starters, WAY to much product is on the wand. I ended up having to scrape lots of it off on the side of the tube. But even after that, I still had to comb my eyelashes to get the clumps out. It does however, promise to be an easily washable mascara, and that part is absolutely true. Sad to say though, I used this just a few times, and gave up on it. I was expecting something better from a brand that is usually pretty good.",1
"I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn't too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!",5
The product arrived earlier than expected :) I am enjoying this night cream. I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I am trying to replace all my face products for more natural ones. So far this is a keeper.,4
"This ia a beautiful rich purple. I absolutely love it. I've been looking for the perfect purple. Not too bright,  not too light, and this is it. Deep beautiful color.",5
My skin has become so smooth and soft since I started using this lotion. It is not greasy or heavy. I have tried many other lotions throughout my life. No need to look any further. This is the best hands down.,5
"This gel nail polish remover is well made, with a solid feel in your hand. The attachments are easy to attach and detach. It works well. The sanding attachment, which is for removing the top coat of the gel polish, was also pretty good for filing nails. I thought using the filing attachment was a little awkward due to the angle of the filing surface, but it did a good job.However, unless you do a lot of nails, I can't imagine why you would want this little gadget. The time consuming part of removing gel nail polish is soaking a cotton ball in acetone, putting it over your nail, wrapping it in foil, and waiting for the polish to soften enough to wipe or peel off. And, you still need to do that when using this nail polish remover. The only thing you gain from using this device is that you don't have to sand off the top coat of the gel polish by hand. The ""cuticle care attachment"" is supposed to be used only with the power off, so it is really just a large pink plastic orange stick.If you're a gadget lover or if you often have occasion to remove gel nail polish from the hands of several people at a time, then you might like this nail polish remover. For me, I'm afraid it's just going to end up rolling around the back of a drawer in the bathroom.",3
"I think this if my favorite mascara. Never clumpy, but still really grabs your lashes, separates and extends. Very close to Benefit's &#34;They're Real!&#34; but for much less money.",5
"I started using the Remington S8590 about a week ago. Until then I was using aRemington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch.The Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor. While I can't really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working. Why? Well, since I replaced my S9500 with the S8590 I've been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Go figure! A flat iron making my hair look healthy.Both Remington flat irons feel great in my hand. Well balanced and sturdy. With the Keratin shine bonus, I'll definitely be using my S8590 daily and save the S9500 for travel.",5
"Like most women, I have tried MANY of self-tanners, bronzers, etc. in all their forms (lotion, spray, wipe, etc.) I have tried Neutrogena, Jergens, L'Oreal, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic... All of them had MANY cons (sticky, streaking, blotchiness, uneven, not enough product, HORRIBLE SMELL...) which caused me to continuously hop around, and keep searching for a near &#34;perfect&#34; self-tanner for me. I have sensitive, fair, caucasian skin, with a mainly yellow undertone. I came to Amazon as I normally do, to find a new tanning lotion for the season. After stumbling across this one, with its decent price and positive reviews, I decided to try it out.Let me just say, that the other reviewers who said that this smells great were right! It has a very light, kind of fruity smell, which is pleasant. Probably because it is an oil based lotion, one pump nearly covered an entire leg from foot to thigh, which is very impressive, and I am the Queen of over-using lotions and moisturizers. It is a white-colored lotion, which turns translucent on your skin once rubbed in. I put it on after I shower at night before I go to bed. The smell stayed pleasant the entire night into the next day, and did not turn into that nasty &#34;self-tanner&#34; DHA smell that most do once they develop. The color developed into a believable, light, golden glowy color after first use, which I will keep on building on, and there was no blotches or streaks! I highly recommend trying this product! :)",5
"Picked this product up at my local Wal-Mart.  The price was right, $8.00 and change.I was a little worried because the product consistency is sticky and thick.On freshly washed, conditioned and damp hair I two strand twisted over night.The next day,  my twist out was soft, well defined, bouncy but a little dull.No need to slather on, a small amount goes a long way.  In fact, sectioning the hair, THEN twisting is better way to go.I recommend & would buy this product again.",4
"This item does not hold your hair well at all. It's not strong enough and keeps slipping off. In addition, one of the items came without being wrapped In a package. I felt like it had been used.",2
This cream comes in a nice little gray velvety bag.  it goes on easily and a little goes a long way.  A big plus for me is that it doesn't break out my super sensitive skin!  It softens dry patches & heals minor blemishes.  No major smell when using is also a nice feature.  The follow up email after purchase explained how to use the cream before it even arrived.  Great seller communication!,5
This product is very grainy and sits on skin.  I can understand shea butter being grainy sometimes but it takes a long time to melt on my skin (like other shea butter products that I've tried).  Never again will I purchase shea butter unless there is a tester available.  I've tried some that are wonderful.  This one is far from it.,2
I love this product! I would recommend it to anyone! It buff nails smooth and soft! I would buy again!,5
"This Hydroxatone scrub does a nice job of cleansing and leaving my skin feeling fresh and exfoliated. It has a bare, but pleasant, scent to it. To call it microdermabrasion might be a bit of a stretch, but it does work as well as any other facial scrub I have tried.The jar that the product comes in is somewhat small (for the price), and I don't particularly like sticking my finger in the jar, preferring the types of products that come in a tube to avoid this. The consistency is pretty thick so this may be why it comes in a jar rather than a tube. It doesn't take a lot of product to get a good result, though, and it rinses very easily.While my face felt soft and clean, I'm not sure that it will provide better results than your average, much less expensive, drug store brand scrub. At least so far, I am not ""transformed"", but happy enough with glowing skin.",4
"This has the exact same scent and consistency as a QVC brand. Had the same results too, not good ones. I have been using self tanners for years. Now and then I will try one a friend might mention they like. I should stick with the one that works for me. Like the QVC version, this one had streaks, some orange to it, and mostly washed off in the shower. I use Hempz self tanner, and matches my natural tan perfectly. No orange, no Streaks no wash off.",1
"This gave a fine shave.  No complaints.  The gel really ""slimes"" your face to a great extent, which may reduce nicks, but would not be my preference, since I use enough shaving lotion already.If the choice were between this one and the HYDRO 5, I must say that I liked the latter better.  I am very glad that the blades themselves are made in the USA.  That seems to make a major difference in the quality of shaves, even with dollar store type razors.  Thank you for a finely engineered product.Recommended.",5
"The hairband is gorgeous, but it is a little small on my head. It makes my hair look very bumpy on, so I'll need to find a way to work with it. Nonetheless, it is beautiful, and I would totally recommend!",4
"I have long, thick, white girl hair.  My hair is healthy, I have never dyed it, permed it, and I rarely blow-dry or straighten it.I love this shampoo.It has a pleasant scent, floral but not too strong.The shampoo seems a bit thinner then I'm used to, and thats okay - I use only a little bit anyway.  It lathered well, and rinsed clean.I used the complimentary conditioner and really enjoyed that too.It leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny!  Highly recommend.",5
"This conditioner wasn't as great as all the reviews I read . I am Native American and had very damaged hair at the time of ordering . I guess if your hair just needs a little tlc you could use and would probably help but it did not help my hair , I still had to do a ton of different treatments to get my hair to where it is now .",3
"I really like the smell. It's very pleasant and it lasts really long. In addition, it's very easy to wash away the foam, so washing hands ""costs"" me less time. Would recommend this product to friends and family.",4
Great hydration without the breakouts. Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance. They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star.,4
"looks very dark, not navy to my eyes.  also i cant get it to crackle like it's supposed to, even after reading how to tips and trying several methods.",3
"I've read other reviewers mention that this product is overly drying.  I will say that I love the scent.  And, I love the very clean feeling after using it.  My pores feel tight after I use it.  It's very refreshing.  As a precaution, I do use it once per day or less, just because I am prone to dry skin.  But, I think drying could be the case with any product with similar ingredients.",5
"This is a good product.  I'd never tried it before until here, and I have to admit, I really like.",5
"Pure Body Naturals has a great Vitamin c Serum. It highlights skin in a beautiful tone. I found the dropper very easy to use and the concentration is high enough to not need much so your product will last longer.I love the money back guarantee. I was fully satisfied with my serum, but it always feels good to know that a company stands behind what they make. I definitely recommend giving this a try!",5
"This stuff is great. It doesn't flake, smear or run. It stays on all day, even when you line the inside ""water line"" of your eye. Great stuff! It glides on like a dream and the brush that's included is perfect for making either very thin or thicker lines. Don't hesitate to purchase...you won't be sorry!",5
have tried several and this is absolutely my favorite.  I get many compliments on the aroma my hair has after using this.,5
"I have very sensitive, acne prone, rosacea type skin. This cleanser did not produce any novel breakouts or redness! No dryness. It is well formulated. I can tell that it helps as a chemical exfoliant because it leaves my face smooth and more bright. Nothing fantastic to really mention, though. It did not help clear acne for me as some people may say it does. It is just a good chemical exfoliant.",4
"I am not going to make pretenses, I am a fan of the entire Aubrey Organics line through and through.  This is an exceptional product of theirs.  One just puts it on starting at the scalp and massaging down to the ends and keeps it on for fifteen minutes before rinsing.  The results are visible the very next day.  And what results are there!  My hair is immediately thicker and fuller and healthier.  It definitely helps with the split ends. I fully recommend.",5
"I have thick, rich, dark black, curly hair that, sadly, splits after it reaches a respectable length beyond my shoulders. I have never colored my hair but it does often get quite dry.In order to prevent my hair from splitting further, I always use a mask or a deep treatment after shampooing. This treatment is about the same as a regular store-bought variety. It isn't as nice as what you'd get at a saloon, but it's also probably 1/7th of what you'd pay for a deep penentrating treatment at a saloon.All in all, I'd say this product is good value. It doesn't deliver nor does it promise miracles, but it doesn't charge a few body parts for the miracle either.",4
"The US Diver's mask and snorkel are perfect for women.  The slightly smaller size means that it won't gap and leak at the sides.  The neoprene strap cover is a nice touch since there is less chance of getting your hair pulled than with just the bare strap.  The snorkel tube is round and flex between the tube and mouthpiece has a fair amount of give.  This makes it easy to move the snorkel out of the way when not needed.  Snorkel also has a purge valve and one-way valve to make snorkel clearing easier.  Good, high quality, mask and snorkel.The color is also really cute! I love the aqua, and while it makes no difference in performance it looks really nice.",5
Use it to hold lips sticks. mascara lip liners etc..,4
"As I've mentioned with other reviews in regards to the Bdellium brush line, I really really love this brush line. I have not had any issues this brush line. The brushes pick up my products with ease and there are no shedding. LOVE IT!",5
I didnt know about this product..im in school and to make my nails look even beautiful..love itThanks so much,5
"I really like this.  It is sort of sticky so the nailpolish you use stays on a bit better. I've had really good luck with keeping pedicures looking good for a week or so, which for me is amazing.",4
"I have fairly long, VERY thick, wavy hair.  This product makes my hair very soft and keeps it from being frizzy.  I absolutely love it!",5
I received my item and it looked used. The sides of the bottle were scratched. Its nasty. I bought this product afterward at the store. I give it two stars for the product but horrible buy over amazon.,2
As soon as I unboxed this brush I knew it was going straight back.  The quality of this brush felt like it was a $5 brush from the drugstore to brush my daughter's dolls or our dog's hair with.  I couldn't believe they charged me over $100 for it.  Granted I didn't try brushing my hair with it (I want my money back and don't want any reason for them not to give it to me) but c'mon the handle is one of the cheapest plastics I've ever felt.  The writing on the handle wasn't even nicely printed on it.  There's more to complain about but I'm so flabergasted at what I just got that I'm speechless.  I read the other review about Mason Pearson Brothers not being the same as Mason Pearson.  Now I believe it!  Don't be fooled!,1
I can use this power with confidents knowing it will cover my gray hair and strengthen it at the same time,5
"Let me start with this: I have over 110 bottles of nail polish. I figured rather than pay $10 for a manicure, I could start doing it myself and buy the polish instead. So I'm a bit of a power user.I started using these when the dark colors were all the rage because they really got in the corners to clean off my nail, working better than cotton balls. Now I love them because if I mess up a nail and the rest of them are wet, I can clean it up and start again w/o damaging the polish on my hands already. Also: generally I only need 2 - 3 to remove polish from both hands. It always takes me way more cotton balls to take it off my nails.",5
Its little tacky I have very fine hair and this was too much for mine but if you have thicker hair it would probably work fine,2
I bought this for my husband.  He said it was easy to install and has already used it.  He loves it and says it is of outstanding quality.  Even has a little squeegee that comes with it.,5
"Had this item a few weeks now, and must say, i'm not completly sold. having reviewed other similiar, more expensive products, i decided to give this a go and see. Well, after a few weeks of testing, I still dont see any difference. Mind you my dark circles are not black, but noticable nonetheless. This product does not appear to have diminished them even by a mere shade and they still look the same before i used the product. So unless your desperate to spend your  hard earned $ on this product, might I suggest a cheaper alternative suggestion? Try getting out of the indoors more, and soak up a little sun. Vitamin a does wonders for the skin and it wont put a dent in your wallet. Just be sure to put on some sunscreen.",3
"Just started using this and I have already noticed that my skin is less dry and irritated after a cleaning.  It seems to have very little smell which I also like about this face wash.  I think that is just about all there is to say about this product.  It does what it says, clean with less irritation.",5
"Terrible medicine, unnatural smell.  And the soap dries out my skin after two uses.  I just can't get passed the smell",2
jojoba is the most like skin oil there is.... i use it after showers while i am still wet so it slides on the skin easily.... for the face you only need one or two drops rubed on wet hands and applied to a wet face... let it dry and you will have soft dewy skin....,5
"I am only giving it 3 stars because it is a very heavy moisturizer ( which can be good) and in the very warm weather, I have to use something much lighter.  You only need a tiny bit.  With that said, this item will last for at least 3 months,",3
I ordered this product or my husband who has been a Head and Shoulders user for years.This is what he had to say:*He liked the design of the bottle.  Easy to grip even with soapy hands.*He liked to way the spout worked with no separate screw on lid.  Easy to work with 1 hand.*He liked the smell.  It's not heavy like H&S; and is far superior to Selsan Blue.*He LOVED that it rinsed out very easily.  With the H&S; he was rinsing several times before he felt that it was all out.This product just 'disappeared'.*He liked that it made a good lather without using alot of shampoo.  He feels it will go further than his H&S.;  Someproducts tell you to use a pea size portion but it's never enough.  With this product very little is needed.I will update my review in a couple of weeks when we have seen how it does on the dandruff.,5
Nice lather; clean rinse and hair that's still fresh and soft at the end of the day.  No problem with color fade.  I've been using this product for a few years - it's that good.,5
Love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner by Fekkai... Possibly reviewed both products before and am sticking to my intense love affair with both of these products. The shampoo lathers up really nicely and rinses easily... The fragrance is out of this world and lasts all day... Your hair feels and looks spectacular. Love Fekkai&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;,5
this is my favorite mascara of all time.  If you apply it right (waiting until the previous coat is dry) it does make your eyelashes pop and they're not clumpy! LOVE LOVE LOVE TARTE!,5
"This is my ""go to"" product for blowdrying my frizzy hair.  It smoothes my hair so that it is ready for easy frizz free styling.  I buy this product over and over.  I hadn't found any other styling product that can do the same thing.",5
"I put this on one thigh every night in thick quantity, as directed, for two weeks and saw NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER between the treated thigh and the untreated thigh.  Please go online and do a little research on what &#34;cellulite&#34; really is before you pay high prices for miracle cream.",1
"I have thick, course hair that is damaged/dry ends (due to ombre style). My hair feels clean and smells great.The Conditioner is thick and goes a long way, I didn't find myself using very much, but my hair feels very hydrated and smooth.It helped seal down my fly away hairs, leave my usually fried looking bangs smooth and silky, and I see zero-frizz.So far, I'm very happy!",5
I am allergic to certain eye makeup removal products This however gives me no adverse reactions. I also like that it is oil free.,5
"I have a great set of expensive Sigma brushes and honestly, the only difference between the two sets is the weight of the Sigmas is heftier. This Coastal Scents set is a wonderful gift set for any girl of any age. They have a funny smell at first - I think it's because of the holder they come in, but that dissipates over time.",4
"I have used this product for over a month, this far. The reason I love this product, is becayse the InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum hosts a componentry of  20% Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid and Organic Aloe; this is compared to several other leading brands which only have 20% Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid. The InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum also has amounts of skin-nourishing Ferulic Acid and the Organic Aloe, as well. What's also interesting is that Ferulic acid is extracted from plants and is one of the most powerful natural anti-oxidant, and is known to be antioxidant dense, which helps stabilize the products Vitamin C and E, making the product more lasting and effective. Also worth noting, the soothing Organic Aloe but Aloe Vera, which can help treat sunburn, treats acne, and it is anti-aging in property. This product is also fabulous as well! I found that like the previous product, a small amount goes a long way in application. It has a fresh smell, and applies quickly, without any sticky residue.",4
"Wow! This shaver is great.  I use it to shave in the shower and I have had no nicks and no mistakes.  It glides around my curves and removes the hair everywhere I shave.  I use it on my legs, underarms, etc.  It is great.  I feel safe using it, and I barely used any shaving soap.",5
"I've been using this for less than a month and I've already noticed growth.The smell is quite noticeable, but it's worth it. You can use other products to help mask the smell of it if it truly does disturb you.",5
"these are my favorite eyelash style to use, and this is a really good brand that is affordable, I used it with Duo glue and it held up really well for the day, they blend in nicely too, I have just about no eyelashes of my own, so fakes really helps",5
I really like this serum.  I am very cautious of what I put on my skin and I read about a product before I use it.  I did not have any worries with this product.  It leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  I had an event I went to an people were remarking about how beautiful my skin was and that I was glowing and wanted to know what I was doing.  You know sometimes you don't want to share your secrets but this is such an awesome product that I didn't mind sharing.  The product is not to thin or heavy it is just right.  No over powering scent and it is just lovely.  I would recommend this product to others.,5
This fragrance is lusciously beautiful without being too overwhelmingly musky or floral. I wear this one often for work and never fail to get compliments. Just makes me feel classy and expensive. Amazon also offers a great price on this one.,5
"Bought this shampoo because it was recommended as being safer for pregnancy by the book &#34;belli beautful.&#34;  it is one of only a few safer products that I will continue to use when pregnancy is no longer an issue, as I love it just as much as my &#34;regular&#34; shampoo.  Too bad it's a little more expensive.",5
"I used this product on a trip to Disney World--the ultimate test for a sunscreen product for children.  My granddaughter emerged after three days without any burn or eye irritation, as it was very humid and sweaty throughout the day.  Of course, it needed to be reapplied as any other sunscreen.  It is smooth and creamy and seems to have more moisturizing qualities to it.",5
"Pros:-no bad smell-no white residue, and i really hate when sunscreen leaves a white hue-does not clog pores-great protectionI have not gotten a sunburn using this yet, and i tan and burn easily. It is a great sunscreen!",5
I love the smell and it works well on my hair. I use it in combination with the Shampoo & Serum and my hair is soft and manageable EVERY day!,5
Nice but shipping isn't great. One of mine were bent at the top but I think I will get alot of use out of them.already found my favorite one.( short one fat handle)  will order again. Package was 2 weeks early.,4
"Good option for those on a budget.  I use it to set makeup in oil prone areas only.  As with all HD powders, will cause camera flashback.",4
"This Skin Obsession line is terrific.  (BTW I had written a review for their 20% peel which I highly recommend, depending on what level of peel you should be using.)Since upgrading to the 25% peel - well first of all, I don't see or feel a significant difference between the 20% + 25%.  Glad I graduated to 25% tho!  **(Since I'm a bit vain and work in a professional environment Monday - Friday, I only do a portion of my face at a time so as not to frighten my co-workers!  Ha! I read the reviews and see that many people do entire face all at once.  Yikes.)Don't use this unless you know how your skin reacts, and don't use unless you're savvy about skin care AND you've had a SIMILAR PEEL before.  If you haven't paid for a TCA peel through your Dermatologist or Esthetician, I highly recommend you have ONE professional one done first so you know if you like it.  Up to you tho!The reviews on Amazon that make this sound so scary....??  I don't get it.  It's NOT scary.  Skin Obsession sends you step-by-step instructions.  Simply follow them.  It's super easy.  There's really not much to it at all.  Takes me max, from start to finish, 15 minutes.  That includes preparation and rinsing and applying oils/creams.Have the following items ready for when you want to do this wonderful anti-aging peel:*Isopropyl alcohol (yep, the one that's been around forever and costs about $1.00)  I happen to already have the 91% at home, but I think there's a 70% as well, so use what you have at home.*little protective gloves - latex or whatever. (I don't use them.  But I'm very mindful and cautious of what I'm doing - never had a problem but it's just a good idea)*Vaseline (or a similar barrier cream/ointment)*Baking Soda*A bowl of cool/cold water - I use a cereal or soup bowl and add about 1/3 cup baking soda to it.  (I never measure.)  Anyway, just add some soda for your after-peel neutralizer.*If you have a little applicator Fan Brush (they're flat and you can get them at Sally Beauty or Amazon or wherever and they're inexpensive)  I don't have a fan brush so I use a flat, clean ""foundation"" brush that I'd never use to apply foundation!  You know, the bristles are about an inch or so long, the brush part is about 1/2"" wide - it can be any size, just use one that's flat if you don't have a fan brush.I keep my TCA solution in fridge.  Probably doesn't matter, but I want it fresh cuz I use it every few months for a couple of years.  Yes, it's still completely effective that long!I gently shake the solution for a second (probably not necessary though) and pour about 1/3 inch of it into a little cap of whatever bottle I find around that had been used on some product....  I just make sure the cap is clean and at least 2 to 3"" deep.After lightly applying the alcohol to cleansed skin areas where you're going to use the TCA (don't rub the alcohol into skin, just glide a pad or whatever over skin to lightly cleanse w/alcohol.)Then apply the vaseline-type product under your eyes and around your nostrils & lips & eyebrows  Anywhere that's sensitive and you don't want the TCA to touch those areas cuz they'll burn.  (you'll survive, but ouch!)When you dip end of brush into TCA solution, make sure it's NOT dripping wet.  Because when you apply to your forehead, and above eyebrows, you don't want any drops to fall.Lightly brush/stroke the solution on the areas you need help with (fine lines/wrinkles/spots).  I leave mine on for about 4 minutes or maybe 4 1/2.  If you have spots you want to apply to, just dip a Q-Tip into solution and use that for spot treatments.The first minute it burns and aches pretty bad.  If you have a fan you can put your face in front of it, it really helps!  If you don't, then just suffer through it.  I find that after about a minute yes, it still burns and is uncomfortable, but it doesn't ""ache"" quite as much.Make sure the areas are turning a frosty white.  When the timer goes off, put your fingers/hand in that cold water and swish the baking soda around and grab handfuls of that cold water and splash/run the water over & over the affected areas.  The baking soda may sting a little.  That's ok.  Do this for at least a full minute.  (their directions will tell you for how long but it's about a minute or 2 minutes).The cold water feels good.  Keep doing that over & over to neutralize the areas that had TCA applied.  Keep your eyes closed.  Don't let any ""overflow"" from the TCA get into your eyes (obviously).I'm not an esthetician.  I'm not an expert.  Follow the manufacturer's directions.  I'm simply a customer of theirs who has been using their peels for a few years.  I use about every 6 to 8 weeks - sometimes I go a few months without.  Just depends on if I think I need to use it.These Skin Obsession peels are AS GOOD AS the dermatologists.  But like I say in my review on the 20% peel, I highly suggest going in to dermatologist or esthetician and PAY FOR A PEEL (you'll love the results) so you know how your skin reacts.  So you'll have an idea if it's something you want to do yourself.  If it is, these home peels are absolutely fantastic.  Just be smart, be mindful, follow their directions and enjoy the results!If you're used to alpha hydroxy products, and retin A, etc., then you've already experienced some of the harsher skin care products.  I would let your skin rest from these products for about 4 days before the peel tho.  Just to give your skin a break from their harshness.Again,I work in a professional setting Monday - Friday.  So I may do this a bit differently than most people because I'm very cautious and also a bit vain (thus the TCA!)  I'm in my 50's btw.Doing a PORTION of my face at a time means I don't need to take any time off work at all!  I usually do the undereye/upper cheek area on one side of face (not too close to eyes tho - that skin right beneath the eye is too delicate) and I do my laugh lines on same side of face.I do these on a Tuesday evening so that the coming weekend is when most peeling happens and that weekend I just run errands and I don't really go out at night.By Friday (3 days post-peel) the area on my face is looking a bit gnarly.  Not a huge deal.  But you can tell it's kind of red, and the skin is leathery and puckering.  The puckering is YUCK.  Kind of awful to see in the mirror, but it's such a good, good thing because the 2 days following the day that you see the most significant puckering, then you're home free - the peeling happens and it's so nice to know it's making a difference!By the following Monday (6 days post-peel) my skin looks softer and more radiant and fresh!!  The lines are softened and foundation or bb cream or whatever looks good on it too!Immediately After the peel + of course the neutralizer (then pat face very gently to sort of dry it...) I alternate between Emu Oil + Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.  Or I use both, together.  Use any cream or oil that is soothing and has no fragrance.  Keep skin hydrated with the soothing products.  I also love using Coconut Oil!  Works great too!These are simply my suggestions and my experience.  If it's helpful, great.  But again, follow Skin Obsession's directions - they cover every single detail!  I had emailed them a couple of times before I started my first peel because I was so nervous.  They answered both emails that SAME DAY.  I trust this company.  I've had great results!  Try just a small area on your face the first time, and you'll see it's a great way to keep your skin looking fresh!  LOVE THIS COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.  I trust them completely.",5
"I have fine (read: thin) caucasian hair and I bought this without being aware of the target consumer base that has thicker hair.  That being said, this product is not meant to style hair like mine.  I used it sparingly by spraying a short pump on my hands before I applied it, and my hair was weighed down immediately.  That being said, it smells so good that I have no intentions of giving it to any of my friends with coarser hair!  I'll be using it as an overnight leave-in conditioner.  Even though this product didn't work for me, I'm glad that I found this brand and I look forward to trying out their soaps.I bought this at my local Target for about $6, so if you are thinking about buying this please don't buy it through this seller.",3
Been using this on my beard.  The quality is high for sure.  I expect this comb to last me a long time.,5
I received a sample towel from The Salon Guys and I love it! I was a little leery at first because the towel was soaked while it was on my head. The reason was it really did absorb a lot of the water from my hair. I have long hair and it was big enough to wrap my hair up in it. I only have one of these but will probably buy some more when I get the extra money. Just wish they were a little cheaper however I really do not know the going rate for microfiber towels.I will say that the towel is soft and comfy. I have not washed it as of yet but it does seem sturdy and like it will hold up in the wash.,5
"The coconut smell was great and the product worked fine. It did nothing more then a regular hair conditioner would do. Not a bad product, but not a great one. My kids love the coconut shampoo.",3
"I was skeptical about ordering this product, as I've tried a lot of similar products and have always been able to tolerate the taste and bite my nails anyways. First opinion of this product is...smells like nail polish remover. I was skeptical because even a little bit of a nail polish remover taste hasn't seemed to work and most just wear off after biting your nails once. Since I got my order last night...I've put it on, and ....first attempt to bite I didn't initially taste it, but boy oh boy is the aftertaste rancid. It takes forever to get the after taste out of your mouth and is a HUGE reminder not to bite. I even tried brushing my teeth to get it out and it didn't help much. After ashing my hands several times it still hasn't worn the taste off of it. Whatever the manufacturers did to make this product to terrible tasting and long lasting...it worked. I absolutely hate putting my hands in my mouth with this stuff on. I'm betting I'll have nice long nails before too long.",5
"I love this leave in conditioner, which has become one of the staples for my haircare.I didn't believe the hype surrounding this Knot Today, and in fact tried everything but this product when I first went natural. Before using Knot Today, I once used Giovanni's Leave In, per the recommendation of another natural. After a shampoo and condition, I'd use Giovanni as a Leave In conditioner for my hair to provide extra moisture. It worked okay, but it didn't soften my hair much.I finally gave in a few months ago, when Knot Today arrived at a local store, to try it. When I first put Knot Today on my hair, I noticed an immediate difference compared to earlier washings. Instant Magic. My hair softened, felt moisturized, had great slip and was easier to detangle. The fresh smell of the product was a bonus. Depending where you get it, the price is a little hefty, but it does last a while (depending on how you use it). I usually just put this one once a week -- to be economical. But, if you use it miore than once a week, I'm sure the benefits will be even greater. For me, a little bit lasts a while.I highly recommend this.INGREDIENTS: Organic Mango fruit extract, organic slippery elm, organic marshmallow root, organic lemongrass, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, citric acid, phenoxyethanol and natural fragrance",5
I bought 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter in law we both love it. It goes on smooth and easy. Does add length to the lashes. It doesn't make them all stick together and clump. I will be buying more!,5
"I treat myself once in a while to a microdermabrasion treatment at my dermatologist. They charge $100 per treatment. This machine does a comparable job and pays for itself quickly. I will no longer be getting these done at the dermatologists. I'll be saving my $100 and using this great little machine. The suction is just fine, I don't really know what some other reviewers are complaining about. It is more than adequate and I only use it at about 1/2.If you are currently paying to get microdermabrasion done, stop and buy this machine! You'll be very glad you did!",5
"I bought this to make my own homemade laundry soap. The bars are huge, so these 3 bars will last quite a while. 1 huge batch of laundry soap only used a fraction of one bar of soap.",5
"I thought this was an actual topsy tail tool, i apparently didnt read the description clearly. When i got it, i was disappointed but tried to use it anyways. The surface is not very smooth, it was hard to get to slide through my daughters hair and my hair, even when wet or with conditioner. The small one is very flimsy and will not easily go through a collection of hair or under the scrunchies. The big one gets caught and tangled, and it actually broke before the 10th time using it...i was trying to pull a half-up pony through the scrunchy, and when it was about halfway through it snapped at the top of the loop! I am going to look for an actual topsy tail now.",1
"I have shoulder length, loose, curly hair.  I use this sea salt spray on both wet and dry hair as a styling aid and it produces tighter, fluffier (more body) curls for me that aren't shiny (nothing wrong w/shiny, but beachy curls are matte, I guess).  On two-day old hair I've already used this wet (first day) and dry (second day as a curl refresh) and it didn't get too sticky (like some other brands that left my hair feeling like I used regular hair spray).  It also has a very light, nice fragrance that seems to dissipate so I could see this as a uni-sex styling aid.  The fine mist doesn't drench your hair, which is good when you're spraying it on dry hair.  Kind of expensive, but the mist is so fine it seems like it will go a long way.  I'd buy it again.",5
"I was sent a sample for review, this is my honest opinion.Vitamin C is something we all need to maintain a healthy and youthful appearance. I try to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink as much water as possible for hydration. I have especially been fond of eating mandarin oranges/clementines/tangerines lately. I am not sure if this is a particular craving I have been having with this pregnancy, or if it is just because I recently discovered I liked them and now I eat 3 a day! I used to eat oranges, but only about 1 orange every month or so. Oranges are messy in my opinion and harder to peel. Also, oranges are more acidic than mandarins. Now don't get me wrong, I do not hate oranges. I drink orange juice almost every morning for breakfast. (I am a bit particular and choosy on which brand of OJ that I consume as I do not like juice from concentrate, nor do I like my juice strong in acidity. I also like my juice with lots of pulp!)Citrus fruits contain phytochemicals that may help lower risk of heart disease and cancer. These fruits are also a good source of essential nutrients, including fiber, folate, potassium and vitamin C. Oranges contain more vitamin C by volume than tangerines--makes sense due to how small mandarins/tangerines are. I have been eating about 2-3 mandarins each day as a yummy and healthy dose of vitamin c. They contains calcium, magnesium and potassium.Vitamin C has been established as a potent antioxidant, it strips free radicals of their harmful toxicity. This helps to prevent damage to healthy cells. According to Livestrong.com, &#34;most women need about 75 milligrams of vitamin C per day, while most men need about 90 grams. People who smoke, as well as those exposed to secondhand smoke, need about 35 milligrams more per day than those who are not exposed to cigarettes.&#34; I have never tried smoking, and never will. Smoking causes wrinkles, decreases vitamin c levels in the body, and speeds up the signs of aging. Exposure to secondhand smoke also decreases vitamin C levels. It makes sense that smoking would cause decreases in vitamin c, because lack of vitamin c causes loss of elasticity and tightness in skin, and causes wrinkling due to lack of collagen production. Aging skin naturally loses this important nutrient over time. Pollution, and over exposure of harmful UV sun rays are also causes of skin damage. It is important to always wear sun protection when you are going to be outside for prolonged periods of time.Vitamin C helps your skin repair itself. Skin will become rough and dry if it is not treated with care and given proper nutrients. Vitamin C through food consumption is beneficial to your health, but for prevention of wrinkles and anti-aging processes on skin and face, topical vitamin C is best. According to Dr. Oz and other health and skincare professionals, applying vitamin C to the skin can be 20 times more effective than taking it orally.I had the opportunity to try out a topical Vitamin C serum from the Mystelic Company. I was sent a sample bottle free of charge to test out. The bottle arrived in a timely manor and was packaged/padded appropriately. It is always vital that all essential oils, serums, antioxidants, etc. to be stored in a dark, glass container as they are vulnerable to rapid deterioration in the presence of air and light. The Mystlic serum is housed in a dark amber colored glass bottle and comes with a dropper for easy of use.I have currently been testing this out for 2 weeks. I do not have wrinkles, however, I do have some darkening under my eyes and some slight loss of tightness around my eyelids. I do not see any abrupt changes or improvements to these areas yet, however, my skin does appear brighter and has a nice even tone. I currently use this twice a day, applied over my entire face, neck, and decollete area with no problems. I use about 1 drop for each side of my face, a drop on my forehead, and a drop on my neck and in between my decollete area. I probably use much more than I need, however, the product feels so refreshing when applied, and the benefits are great, so I use this amount.It is recommended to begin use at only one time per day as excessive use of topical vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking in some individuals. I have not had any problem with excessive dry areas, however, to amend overly dry skin, apply a light moisturizer or facial oil about 5 minutes after applying the serum. Jojoba oil is a nice oil to use.The Mystelic Vitamin C serum is a light non-greasy formula, and applies similar to a pure aloe vera gel. Manufactured in the U.S.A, it is a natural serum with top quality ingredients. This company stands behind their products, they offer a no questions asked product guarantee, &#34;If within 45 days, you're not 100% happy with results, just let us know and we'll refund 100% or your purchase price.&#34; I am pretty happy with this serum, and will continue using it as I feel it is beneficial for a happy, healthy, glowing complexion and skin tone.  I have only tested this 2 weeks, so as with most products, rapid results are not seen immediately.  This may not work for everyone, and probably wont cure deep wrinkles.  I do see it as a preventative serum, and intended to nourish skin and improve tone and vitality.This is a list of the ingredients.

"I liked this lotion a lot but I had 2 issues with it:1) The brown color wipes off & smears on my clothes & beach blanket (yuck!). The brown stains for the most part wash out of the fabrics but are embarrassing to walk around with until I can change clothes, & that's more laundry to do than should be necessary. Not cost-effective.2) Not crazy about the smell. It smells a little of coffee but more strongly probably of the nut oils; it overpowers any other scent I put on. The smell is overwhelming when I put it on all over.Other than that I really liked the tan sheen this lotion gave me, though I didn't find it to make much difference in the speed or quality of my suntan. Maybe I didn't burn as quickly with it on as without, but I would still burn if I didn't put on a separate sunscreen, so adding an additional product is still absolutely necessary for beach outings & any sun exposure longer than 30 min.I love it for the look of summer tan legs in shorts, dresses & skirts, but again the product wipes off on whatever it touches, so there's always something to clean or wash. And I'd dare not sit on my couch with it on. On the skin it is oily & doesn't sink into the skin - it stays oily over the skin just like any other typical oil. I wanted to really love this procut (I love Hawaii & there are great ingredients in this) but I haven't bought another bottle, sadly.Though it looks like lotion, it really should be called oil.",3
"A bit expensive, but product works well to target grey hairs.Best advice for hard to dye grey hair is to do that part of your hairline first. Leave dye on there for 5 minutesthen do the rest of the hair. This product made the hair dye work about 2 weeks longer thanthe dye usually works. Plus the dye was absorbed better into the hair.Did not make my hair brittle or dry. Very Good Product.",4
"At least one of the other reviewers is obviously involved in the company. They have a ton of awkward reviews for real Techniques brushes raving about the youtube videos and where exactly you can buy them all.I wanted the sigma f84 but this was cheaper and had a five star rating so I bought it anyway. It's crap. totally different. This brush is completely flat so you have to use it like you are spackling your face rather then blending it in. The bristles are far too long and do not keep their shape while applying foundation. All in all, a waste of money.",1
"A while back I saw little packages with just enough cream to use 1 time for a mask at my grocery store. I wanted to get a few, but couldn't find them anymore so I checked Amazon and found these. So I ordered them cause the price was awesome. I was pleasantly surprised when I got them and noticed they are actual fabric masks to put on your face!!! Maybe I am late, but I never even saw those before! I love that there is no mess. And my husband gets a kick out of it and says I look like Jason! HAHAHA! I would definitely get these again. My husband has to go to Korea in April and I already told him to look for these and stock up on them! :)  So far I only used the lemon kind and there was a bit of burning at the beginning, but it went away after a few minutes. It also had plenty of moisture, and I could spread the liquid from the mask to places the mask didn't cover, such as my nose and lover chin and neck. I love them!",5
Great eye liner for lower lash line. It came with 2! The blender brush is really really hard tho so be careful.,4
"I ordered this for my husband who has sensitive skin.  He really loves the product.  No scent, soothing and non drying.  I really like Dove products myself, and this is another winner.  Highly recommended.",5
"I got this straightener for my wife seeing as it has claims to new technology far beyond the capabilities of my wife's old, but high-quality straightener.  Well, she was very impressed the results.  The control over temperature and (possibly) the technological advances left her with very straight, and shiny hair (meaning undamaged, I guess).  Although she did not like that the heating elements didn't sit flush with the rest of the unit, which is what she's used to.She was also pleased by how quickly it heats up and the light weight.  However, she thought it felt a little flimsy and the lock to keep it closed could have been a little better.  THe carrying case is okay, but she had a hard time getting it to fit in properly at first.Her only other concern was that it might be easy to accidentally set the temperature higher than intended, but this is compared to a straightener without any heat controls.  So I guess it would have been nice if there were a slider to lock the controls?  When I got this straightener for her, i thought it seemed pretty expensive, but actually her old one was about two or three times as much.  So, I guess all-considered this is a pretty good value.",4
I bought this brush from my hair salon; it was 7$.  My stylist suggested it to me and also used it on my hair.  It works just like it says!  I have tangled wavy frizzy hair and this does not pull and detangles very nicely!,5
"I was looking for a hairspray that would hold my very fine, thin, color-treated hair.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  It does make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it won't hold my hair in place for more than a few minutes.  I found I was spraying and respraying in hopes that it would keep my bangs out of my face, however for me there was no holding power.  I think it would work to tame split ends or frizzies, but not for keeping hair in place.",1
"Axe Anti-dandruff styling cream soothes my ultra-sensitive scalp while controlling my crazy hair a bit - enough to take it from Bride of Frankenstein to Boticelli's Venus (just the hair, folks) on a bad day. Usually, I just roll it up in a tight bun when it won't behave, but special occasions sometimes  require a little more, and I don't need it to make my head itch!",4
"I have said so long to my dry dead hair and hello to soft and healthy hair. This product works great on my hair I mix it with the Kanechom Goat's Milk and it really works. My hair needs all the help it can get, and with this product I don't have to pay high salon prices anymore. I am saving money and looking great who could ask for more",5
"I only use this for highlighting my face after I contour.  It looks very pretty an subtle.  There are no giant flakes of glitter or anything.  My only complaint is that it is very hard to get enough product on my brush for it to show up properly.  I am not experienced with &#34;baked&#34; powders so this may be normal.  Overall, great product for the price and it should last a good while!",4
"I like to wait a few weeks before reviewing a product because my initial hope that a product will actually work usually clouds my judgment. It has been so hard to resist reviewing this product and I can't put it off any longer! This little sponge is AMAZING.I used to use brushes on my face to apply my foundation and something just looked really off every time I applied it. It would look streaky or very cakey and just overall very unnatural. With this sponge, my face seriously looks amazing with my Revlon Colorstay foundation. It really doesn't even look like I'm wearing makeup as there's no streaks at all and it just creates a very flawless finish.At $20 for one sponge, yes, it is pricey. I've tried dupes but they just don't compare. Splurge on this and you won't regret it.TIP: I recommend searching this product on youtube and watching videos on how to correctly use it. I think a lot of people don't really know how to properly use it and the sponge won't work as great if it's not damp.",5
I was looking for a more natural deodorant to replace my Arm and Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant.  So I read the reviews and looked at the price...and decided to try it.  Well so far it's been such a great product!  And it's even more natural than A&H!  I will be buying this again :),5
"It is a little pricey and did not noticed any significant difference. It does have a nice texture and smell,.",3
"I got this product in Walmart and excited to try it. After couple times use, it leaves my skin redness and itch. I trust what it says that its for normal-dry skin but now im suffering from itch. I recommend not buying this product if you have dry sensetive skin. Overall, this product is great, but just not for me.",3
"I used to use this product on my face but have since found products better for inflammation and aging. As an esthetician I am cynical of all products and have a wait and see on my own skin. I like this product only at night-because always during the day you need to have on spf and this is heavy enough. I like this product but it doesn't let your skin breathe so well and I never break out-but did have occasional breakouts from it. I love it on my lips, cuticles and on my hands after putting on a serum or retin A product. Elbows, feet also.",3
I think this is the best bronzer around.  I've tried soooo many and this is the best quality ever. Its matte which is great!,5
"Neutrogena claims that there will be ""visible results in just one week"".The only results that I saw within one week were ALL of the side effects posted on the side of the box:1) mild redness:  my skin is light, so the redness was visible & I had to wear darker foundation to cover up the redness;2) warm, tingling sensation: my skin felt like it was badly sunburned & was very sensitive to touch for about 3 days;3) flaking: skin felt dry & flaked just as warned (I doubled up on my daily moisturizer).The redness, sensitive skin & flaking did subside after 3 days (I went to every other night per the instructions).  I've been using the product for over 2 weeks & see a bit of softening of my laugh lines in the morning, but the laugh lines return by the end of the day.  Small wrinkles around the eyes and forehead creases haven't changed at all.Impressions:The bottle is a nice looking bottle, but is tall and is deceptive in the amount of product that it contains (there is only 1oz of product & the bottle looks like it holds much more).  Also, the bottle is a solid color, so it is impossible to tell how much or how little product is left in the bottle.There are 31 ingredients in the bottle & Retinol is ingredient #27.  Water is the #1 ingredient.This product did not work for me. I am disappointed.",1
Love but a bit on the sparkly side. I use in conjunction with my normal matte bronzers. Try and love.,4
"I love this stuff. It's very gentle and it smells pretty good. It gets all of my makeup off and doesn't dry out my face too much or cause me to break out. Pair this with a decent moisturizer, and it's all the skin care you need. I switched to this stuff from Cetaphil and will probably never go back. This two pack was a pretty good deal when I bought it for $13 back in May, but now that it's $17 I will probably buy it somewhere else. If it were still the original price that I paid, I would probably buy this again.",5
I leave the peel on all night long. Yes it does burn little in the beginning but the burning goes away after a while. Does help drying out skin if you have oily skin. Buy it you will be happy.,5
"I have a lot of thick, long, hair which does not like to stay curled. This has been the first inexpensive curling iron to work on my hair.  It gives me neat sprial curls from top to bottom. I've read some of the other comments regarding a dent that the iron can leave...I've never gotten the dent...maybe its the way they position the iron.I also recommend using Salon Grafix's freezing hairspray if you have difficulty getting your hair to hold a curl.  This has been the only hairspray that holds my hair.The iron heats up quick, it also has the turbo heat option which allows it to heat up in a minute.I would recommend this iron for anyone!",5
"I love Ecotools, its soft and it doesn't shed like others. It's easy to clean and dries fast. I have this to travel and the regular size to keep at home.",5
Best eye liner I've ever used! Good on like butter!  And stays on well.  Highly recommend!,5
"I love this stuff. I use it in the kitchen,  both bathrooms, take it on trips, and wash my baby exclusively with it. It provides a nice lather and I have gone through 4 of the bars already. I will be buying it again and again. I think its an extremely good basic soap.By the way, unlike glycerine soaps, this wont microwave well...so don't plan on using the scraps for soapmaking if you microwave your soap scraps together.",5
"As a Licensed Esthetician, I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on. When I saw this serum with all it's action packed ingredients I was excited to try it. My clients are always asking for my recommendation on skin care products and I was so happy to tell them about this one. You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away. I use it all around my eyes as well. It give you a bit of a tight feeling in a good way. I moisturize immediately after morning and night and that's all I need. Their customer service is amazing as well. This is a big deal for me as I deal with so many vendors. I'm so happy I found this product.",5
"Big enough to cover all your hair and keep everything dry. These are not as nice as those expensive shower caps, but are definitely worth the price. They will last for a while before you need to throw them away.",4
"I like them a lot. They are the right size for nails. However they are just shapes bent up, so there is little area to glue onto nails.  I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy. I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!",4
I've used several face products over the years and they were some what disappointing but this one works really well. So much so my husband says my face is glowing. It's the best that I've used without going to get a chemical peel from a professional plus none of the after affects just great results. It works and for the price it's a great buy. I recommend this to my friends and family.,5
"So I must admit I am a bit of a mascara snob. Typically I prefer Givency or MAC, however on a lark I thought I would try a less expensive brand. After a few uses I was actually rather pleased. Their short and long fibres do work well together and the product did give me some nice length. My only caution to those that aren't aware, the models for most all mascaras have false lashes or have been photo enhanced so do not expect to recreate their precise look. (in Europe manufacturers are required to disclose this). That being said, for less than $10.00 I think it was a good buy.",4
"When these were on sale I should have purchased more.  I really like this eyeliner pencil and the smudge end is very useful.  I had no issues with smearing or anything, and stays pretty much most of the day.  I also like the fact that the black color isn't VERY black, and it looks more natural than some black eyeliner pencils.  I would definitely buy again.",5
"This product is perfect if you want to straighten Barbie hair. (Don't actually try that.) It's so small... This is probably useful if you're one of those people that have perfect hair all day and have a rogue curly section every now and then. But if you're like me, your whole head gets nappy after a long trip anywhere. This thing would take me hours to straighten out all the curls. I ended up cutting the cord and letting my son pretend it's an alligator.",3
THis also works great as a concealer on blotchy areas of your face!  Goes on really nice and keeps my eyeshadow on most of the day.  Good product!  I would order more.,5
"Different from the prior ones I bought, this material in and out it does not get wet and by that said its not keeping any undesired odor inside. Love the size, is pretty comfortable!!!",5
"I like the light scent and I use it instead of water to &#34;reset&#34; my curly hair, it gives it a much better feel and way less frizz than using plain water. Sometimes I'll use a little water and then finish up with the Tresemme, either way, much better results than plain water. I like it a lot and will probably buy it when I run out of my trial bottle. I did not give it 5 stars because I'm not over the moon gaga about it, but it's definitely worth 4 stars as a great product.",4
"Love this exfoliating gel facial cleanser! It very gently exfoliates, which is key since I don't want a harsh scrub. It left my skin feeling amazingly super soft and clean and didn't strip my skin. I also liked very subtle fragrance and nice lather.",5
Leaves my hair soft and feeling strong. I put it on before I go to bed and wake up pliable and ready for the day!,5
"I ordered this product because I saw Fleur of FleurDeForce on Youtube usuing this and reccomending it as a lower-priced alternative to contouring/bronzing powder. I was skeptical about purchasing this because I find a lot of high street or drugstore product have think, chunky powders and overly glittery highlighters, but this was way beyond expecations. Both powders are so finely milled and creamy that they glide right on. The highlighter has just enough shimmer to enhance the face without enlarging pores or looking cakey. I also have fairly light skin (I wear Chanel Perfection Lumiere in 12 Beige Rose), and the color match was perfect! I will be using this product often, and I'm already looking forward to purchasing it!",5
I've battled oily skin all my life and this stuff is absolutely amazing! It keeps the oil at bay so my makeup doesn't run south during the day. A little goes a long way so using it sparingly. I always keep this on hand because I just can't wear makeup without this under it.,5
"I've been only using this for like 3 days, so i dont know if that will bring me any long term effect yet, but so far i like it! The texture of this gel is very fancy which is almost like a condensed primer. It leaves my face moisturized but not greasy. I am looking for long term improvement now.",5
"But even on my bleached highlights, this color did not take too well. I think it would only work if you have really white bleached out hair. I dont want to go that far, as I have dark hair. But the thick gel is easy to use, and Manic Panic is , to me, the best as far as crazy colors go.If you have very light/blond/white hair, this will be great for you to add streaks or a whole head of great pink hair!",4
"As someone whose hair is showing the effects of aging, I was drawn to this product's description. It certainly sounded like a dream. However, like many dreams it failed to live up to reality. Overall, this is a nice shampoo for normal to slightly dry hair. However, it doesn't perform miracles, and I didn't notice a difference between this and other Pantene shampoos I have used over the years. My hair did look very shiny after I used it but again, I have achieved the same effect with other Pantene shampoos. This was good but nothing special.",3
"I bought this for slight acne on my chin because I was sick of using the liquid concealers and decided to try it. It smells bad, makes it look like you have dust on your face, didn't hide any acne, and the powder gets everywhere, on the floor, on your hands, etc. I won't complain about liquid concealers after trying this anymore.",2
"By far the best sunless tanner I have tried thus far in my 20 years of being an avid tanner. I recommend Fake Bake to everyone I know, no matter your skin tone it blends beautifully :)",5
"These are my favorite wipes, and Amazon sells them for less than my local drugstore. It's a perfect item to keep on auto-order. Thank you Amazon, for making my life a bit easier, and helping keep my skin clean... AND I get to avoid another errand!",5
"The Dove Fresh Awake for men is a body and face wash that has a clean, lemony scent. It's even a light yellow in color. It's a really nice, light scent and not overpowering. It's hard to do a good job with citrus scents sometimes because they can come off as a household cleaner smell but this one is really nice. Dove did a good job with it.The lather is super. Does a great job cleaning as you would expect from Dove.",5
Add a little hot water like the directions say and this fizzes like crazy. Use a tall glass. I mix it afterwards with OJ and it tastes fine. That was my biggest concern. It supposed to help you relax and sleep at night. I will update after some time to see if it really works,4
These are great!!! I never knew about these and I was telling my girlfriend about the shoes I wanted to keep but I had to get used to the heel on the back and 1 strap was killing me. Then she told me about these and they are great. You get several of them and I put it on and then it didn't hurt!! Just take the strip off the back and stick it on the strap!! I am 1 happy girl!! Maybe I could even wear slingbacks!!,4
"it's a big surprise for me. after more than 5 weeks that i use this serum twice a day, first 2 weeks, it looked better, the dark spots faded away a little bit, and then stopped, nothing happened after that. i'm still using it everyday even i have not seen any progress on my face anymore. i would like to see until i finish this bottle what will happen, so i can post the last result. so far i'm still wishing that this serum might have the little miracle on my face.",1
"This new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is hands down the best shave gel I have ever used. It mostly comes down to personal budget and opinion when it comes to shaving products, but this new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is worth consideration if you're looking for a nice shave gel that won't murder your face. The smell is pleasant and relaxing, the gel turns into an incredibly rich cream-like lather, and boy does it soothe skin! I used to avoid shaving with manual razors at all cost because my skin gets irritated that easily, and I've used just about every kind of gel/cream imaginable including $6-$7 Gillette and Nivea products that are half of the size of this. So Dove is definitely doing something right to have earned a spot as a mainstay in my bathroom. The razor glide is very smooth and painful/irritating razor pull is non-existent, a feeling I haven't experienced since before I started growing facial hair!Bottom line; if you are seeking relief for your sensitive skin, or just want a superior quality shave from a budget friendly product I would highly recommend you take this Dove Men+Care Sensitive shave gel into consideration. As far as being cost-effective, you won't find a better product! Very comfortable shave, won't dry skin, eliminates razor burn, smells great, rinses clean and won't kill the wallet. Final opinion will always come down to personal taste, but if you're looking for the best bang for your buck, look absolutely no further!",5
This shower brush is 15 inches long and has a curved handle. The handle is see through and tinted blue. It has a series of ridges on the handle so you can still grip it even when it's wet and soapy. It also has a rope that allows you to hang it up after using it so that it can dry. I would suggest rinsing it out good before you hang it up to maximize the life of the brush. In many way's it the typical shower brush just like you can purchase at many grocery and general merchandise stores with one small exception that may be good or bad depending on your preference. Some shower brush bristles are too soft for me personally and they don't scrub my back enough. This brush is firmer and really gives your back a good scrubbing. I like it better for that reason but if you prefer a gentle cleaning then you may not feel the same way.Sample provided for review.,4
"I loved the idea of using a foam instead of going through the time consuming process of regular at-home hair dyes, but this product fell short. As others mentioned, the foam was more runny than fluffy, and seeped out of my hands as I was applying the product. The smell was awful and very strong, so if you're going to try this stuff please do so in a very well ventilated area.I used the lightest golden brown on my already light brown hair, and it came out much darker! I liked the color, and it eventually lightened up, but it was definitely not the color on the box. I really hope Clairol improves their formula because the foam was easier to apply and rinse out, but the smell and darker than on the box color were disappointing.",3
"Love the high SPF and the fact that it *easily* applies.  It's fairly thick, so easy to get the recommended amount on / rubbed in.  I've been using this for years and like it much better than Eucerin, which is the same SPF but much thinner and difficult to rub in.",5
"The formula is somewhat ""gel/ liquid like"" and I love it! Don't worry, it's not runny in any way! The mascara never clumps when I apply it to my lashes and it doesn't smudge or flash throughout the entire day! I LOVE IT! My new dark and lushes lashes. YUM YUM :)",5
like the colors for evening or even day time. You can create amazing looks with this palette. Good pigmentation. Well worth it. :-) :-) :-),5
"I've used L'Oreal products in the past and have since tried other brands ofmoisturizers. This feels great on my skin when applied, and doesn'tfeel oily. Especially good on the neck area, and gentle enough to be usednear my eyes.  Found the price VERY reasonable on Amazon as well, compared toothers that I found less effective.",5
"Easy to use, dries faster than other matte polishes, nice brush for application, and a perfect matte finish.I use it to create contrast in manicures, or over the base color when I want the glossy designs on top to really pop.",5
"I'm one of those people who finds the rotary action distracting - you have to try hard to keep this thing ""on track.""  So I'm going back to a Clarisonic - costs way too much, but at this point it's worth it.  I had high hopes but just can't deal with the rotary spinning that makes you work harder.  I think it cleans just as well, but Clarisonic is really on to something with the other kind of brush action.",1
"I was wanting a nice bubble bath but didn't want something too...florid.The rosemary mint has an awesome smell, isn't overpowering, bubbles well, and makes my skin feel nice and smooth.Looking forward to buying again!",5
I've used this shampoo for over 15 years; great results; keeps my hair healthy. This is a decent price. It isn't always easy to find -- or people price it very high.,5
"Having gone from long hair to short I wasn't sure what to do with it or how to get it to look like my hairdresser had styled it.  This nifty tool solved all the issues. I can go strait, add more lift even a bit of curl and it's soft and natural feeling.  It's the best styling tool in my large collection and I don't need to use as many products.",5
"The first day that I used it, the little rope came apart. Then, the mesh itself fell apart. I should've returned it, but I just threw it away in disgust. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product. I would recommend buying a similar mesh brush at your local Wal-Mart. I've had far better luck with those.",1
"Hempz moisturizer lotion (Age Defying and Cumcumber & Jasmine)  really moisturizes and makes my skin feel silky, and it smells very nice.  I have been using for a while, getting it from my nail salon.  The only problem was the $22 it cost there.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the Amazon price of $11.95, and no shippping costs since I am Prime member.  I just wish other Hempz scents were also Prime eligible.",5
this worked soooooooooooo perfect !!!!! there are 3 different ways u can cut ur nails and the instructions tell and show u how. I love this nail cutter !!!! just like the salons.,5
"This stuff is Great.  Looks great.  Feels great, and a terrific price as well!  HIghly recommend.  Will buy in a few more colors!",5
"Nice fruity smelling dry shampoo.  does make hair feel a bit more course, but does wonders in keeping my second, and sometimes third day hair, less flat.",4
"This makes my hair feel soft, takes away the fizziness and it smells good as well.  I have introduced it to a few friends and one of them even orders her own from Amazon now.",5
This stuff was too dark and cakey. It aged me ten years all the powder settled into every crevice and didn't smooth anything out. Also not enough coverage for my skin. I have lots of scars from previous acne and this didn't help me out.,2
"I had never used any of the Gold Bond line of products before.  An allergic reaction to a bath wash pushed me to order it.  The aroma is slightly minty, but the effectiveness of the lotion is amazing.  I am a believer.",5
"This lotion is great for my sensitive, reactive skin. It doesn't sting or ball up under makeup. I love that it has sunscreen (though SPF 30 would be nice!). Barrier lotions are new to me, and I think it's really made my skin less red in the past few weeks. Will definitely try their other products.",5
"I am in my mid twenties and have started noticing a few fine lines around my eyes and forehead.  I bought this product with a few other ROC moisturizers after hearing great things about them.  This one lives up to the hype.  I use about a pea-sized amount around my eyes at night and before putting my heavier moisturizer on in the morning.  At first my skin felt a little tight and sensitive, but that feeling went away after about the first week of using this.  I feel as though my little crepey lines have improved greatly.  I would reccomend this product to anyone!",5
"This product is one of those that give a pampered feeling. You know--""Aaaaah! This is luxurious and relaxing and a bit special!""  If the money is within the pampering budget, the purchase might be justified for that result alone.For me, the price is more than I would pay, because as a moisturizing treatment, it left much to be desired.  I tend to have a problem with cracking and peeling cuticles, so I moisturize my hands often.  Even when I left these gloves on for about three hours, my hands seemed to return to their normal dry state within an hour or so.  The two best things I have found for the problem are 1) rubbing in a light mineral oil after bathing (wipe off my palms, and I'm all set to monopolize the computer ""while it soaks in, dear,"" or 2) a plain cold cream or something similar; in either case, an oil-based product, which this is not, in spite of a couple of oily-sounding ingredients.The little slippers were better, because I normally don't do much with my feet, on the theory that I won't bother them if they don't bother me.  So it felt cool and pleasant to wear the footie thingies.  I don't think it made any difference for more than an hour or so, but it was nice while it lasted.  They were a nearly perfect fit for my size 7-1/2 feet; much bigger and they might be a bit snug.As for the buffer, if you need it, a pumice stone does a better job with less work.So if you like the psychological effect of a bit of pampering--and who doesn't, from time to time?--you might enjoy this product.  If you need a good moisturizer, you can find better for less money.",3
"The maybelline New York XXL 24hour Bold Mascara, very black...sucks. I don't like it at all. The only good thing about it is, it is very black. First, the wands are tiny small second, it clumps and makes the eyelashes look really bad. Third, from looking at the container you would think it came with alot of mascara but there is very little in the tube. Did I mention that it clumps the eyelashes and really bad. It just looks awful and I DO NOT recommend it at all to anyone.",1
"I received this product and was very excited to try it out. It came in Adovia&#8217;s normally beautiful packaging. It was a little banged up (the box it was in), but that wasn&#8217;t a big deal. It&#8217;s the product itself that I care about most. I took it out and noticed it came in a nice glass bottle with a pumper.I wanted to try it out right away, so I made sure to wash my face and dry it. After it dried, I attempted to pump some of the product onto my fingers and found that the pumper did not work. I was bummed out about that. I ended up unscrewing the cap to rub some of the product on my fingers from the &#8220;straw&#8221; part of the pumper. This is a little inconvenient.So after that whole event, I finally got around to getting to try the product on my face. It went on nice and easily and absorbed quickly. You can easily wear this product under moisturizers and makeup. It&#8217;s a nice non-greasy creamy serum. I&#8217;ve been using it for a while now and have noticed my skin is softer and some of my fine lines seem to be reduced. I think the vitamin C in this product has helped with that part. The softness of my skin is wonderful and I truly believe in the power of the Dead Sea Salts.The product really doesn&#8217;t have much of a scent and would be great for all skin types and for those with various skin issues. I think with long term use, this product would really make my skin look young and vibrant. I can&#8217;t wait to find out!Despite the issues I&#8217;ve had with the pumper not working on the bottle, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce the signs of aging (fine lines, loss of elasticity, etc). It works great!",4
"Just got these brushes in today, tested them out, and I am very satisfied with this set. The brushes are really soft, and they look like they could go for 40 bucks instead of 18, which is a plus. I haven't experienced any shedding yet.",4
"Really need to use it longer, but am seeing some slight changes in the color of my under eye dark circles. Puffiness is gone and that is great.",4
"I have very long, thick, wavy hair that is extremely difficult to detangle when wet (which is the only time I can brush it unless I straighten it because then I'm left with lots and lots of frizz). This brush is a godsend. I have LITERALLY broken the handles off of brushes before while attempting to pull it through my hair and this brush has survived three months of hard use and is still as good as new. It makes getting the tangles out quick and easy and painlessly as well.I always thought that since I have such long and thick hair then the larger brushes were the ones I should be getting. I never thought such a small brush could ever work for me but this has honestly been the best brush I've ever used.My baby is not born yet but I'm not even planning on buying another brush at first because I think this one will work beautifully. We shall see if I'm correct!",5
"Thick but not greasy, beautiful black color, breathable, doesnt smear, dries fast, no smell and doesn't get sticky.  I have very sensitive skin and have not had issues.  I previously loved lancome and maybelline softlash but use this now.",5
"Love the feel of the lotion. And that it's got tons of moisture, but doesn't leave that nasty residue on your hands. It smells great as well. And my husband is okay with it because it's not the ""girly"" scent! :)",4
"I decided to buy this after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon. My face is always red. Most of the time I look like pale tomato, other times I look like a lobster. I don't have rosacea but my face is constantly red and is overly sensitive. I usually wear a medium to full coverage foundation, but I hate that I look like I'm wearing a mask, so most of the time I just live with the fact that my face is red. As I've gotten older, my face has spots that have gotten redder and I can't afford laser treatments for it yet. So I decided to give this product a try. I've used green concealers in the past with mixed results, mostly I looked like I had a greenish cast to my skin. I've used yellow ones with better results, but still don't want to have to cover my whole face in yellow concealer before putting on foundation. Which is why I LOVE this stuff! It's sheer yet tones down the redness quite a bit without any irritation. It layers well underneath my Bare Minerals foundation. It is not a concealer though. I got a little too heavy handed with it my first use and the spots where I put too much primer on, the foundation clung to. Putting a thin even layer on evens out my skin so much so that on days I don't feel like wearing makeup, this is all I put on. I almost don't even need foundation now! I do have a couple of spots that require concealer, and I'm still looking for a good one to layer with this primer and my foundation, but overall I am thrilled with this product. It's better than I would have expected and much cheaper than the Smashbox one that I considered buying! Definitely will be buying and using this for as long as they make it! Oh and the SPF is mineral (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide) which make it even better for my sensitive skin since I can't wear chemical sunscreens.",5
"With a name like Pro-X I am imagining that Olay has targeted this as a more serious and professional level product to compete with the luxury brands such as Dior, Elizabeth Arden. Certainly, the packaging is very upscale and the red color has a wow factor.I have had a great experience with Olay Regenerist Age Defying series of products. Especially [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz]. I have been a fairly regular user of this serum for 2 years and love the results. I don't need it for wrinkle repair yet but it keeps my skin soft and smooth and really silky. People always comment on the glow when I use this product more regularly. I usually wear it at night and sometimes mix a small quantity with makeup for day time use.This Pro-X set seems to be essentially the same product as the Regenerist range. Perhaps it is a bit more concentrated and will give better results over time but it is hard to say after trying for just 2 weeks. I would prefer the serum if they made it without the SPF 30 factor, so it could be more colorless as that feels really silky (rather than milky) and works better with makeup. The night creme and the eye repair cream are both great products and are also irritation free.Overall, for 3 products I think it is a good value when you see the results. Over time I am sure this regimen will yield great results and diminish fine lines and would work especially well for 45+ women. A much better solution than Botox!",4
"I absolutely love this soap.  I love the fragrance, the lather, and the fact that it doesn't leave me itchy.  This soap is of a superb quality.  It is so dainty, lovely, and beautifully-fragranted.Highly recommended.",5
"I have used Suave kids hair products for several years with my three kids.  For my son, with short and very straight hair, they work great.  The smell is wonderful and there is no feeling of build up that often comes with a 2 in 1.  For my girls, who have very curly hair, this product isn't always sufficient alone.  It cleans their hair very well.  However, with such thick and curly hair, the conditioner isn't always enough.  I usually have to use a dedicated conditioner or extra de-tangler, especially if they have been swimming.  But overall, I still really like the product and the tear free formula that really works.",4
I got this conditoner because of reviews and tutorials I've seen. The product is blue in color the consistency is thick and the smell puts you in the mind of hairdressings like royal crown and ultra sheen that were used years back. I use it as a leave in and base for my wash n go's. A little definitely goes a long way so unless you want your hair to look like its full of foamy white stuff use this sparingly. Its a good product and will last a good long time.,4
"I was hoping I wouldn't have to wear foundation, but this is so light I have to use both.  I won't buy again because I have sunscreen.  I was trying to get rid of one step!  If you don't need a lot of coverage, this would be a great product to have.",3
"This is the PERFECT set of lip gloss.  The perfect combination of colors so you have one for every conceivable outfit and occasion, and just the right amount of shine to look polished but not like you just stuck your lips into a vat of industrial epoxy.Importantly, the look lasts a long time (if you don't chew on your lips like I do) and while they don't have any particular flavor or scent, they do NOT have any bad flavors or scents.Besides, if you're both on a diet and chew on your lips the last thing you need is to put on lip gloss that tastes like cherry cheesecake and wafts continuous smells of dessert at you.Excellent buy - definitely recommend.",5
"It's ok. I wouldn't purchase the replacement heads for it because I don't feel like it works any better than a washcloth. The bristles are rough, and I felt like it made my skin redder than it normally is. Like many other reviewers have said, do not use if you have sensitive skin.",2
This is an excellent product.  I prefer to purchase the Konad Stamping Images because it seems they are shallow enough to get an excellent print to transfer.  I look forward to future offerings and thank you for your prompt service.,5
The little packages of glitter are just that---little. There isn't much glitter in them at all. Not recommended. I would keep looking plus it takes forever to come in.,3
Smells awesome - feels great on my hair.  I don't need to use a conditioner when I use this instead.  Did you know it's also good for your skin?  I put a little on my face after a shower and I get that wonderful smell and soft skin without it being greasy.,5
"After completing a full 2-week course of Olay Definity Skin Rehab, I have to say I liked the product, but didn't love it.I've used Olay for years.  I'm 37 and am seeing signs of aging around my eyes and lips.  My skin is pale with some discoloration on the cheeks from chronic dryness.  Currently my nighttime moisturizer is Olay Regenerist serum, which I really enjoy as it exfoliates well and keeps the red on my cheeks down better than anything else I've found.I replaced Regenerist with Definity for 2 weeks.  The first week is ""detox"", which is a fancy way of saying exfoliation.  It was a good moisturizer and exfoliated as well as Regenerist, but not better than.  The Definity lotion was thinner and with a nicer, more gentle scent than Regenerist, though.The second series was 6 days of ""deep recovery"".  This was a thicker, more potent moisturizer.  Here I did see a difference, with the red rough spots on my cheeks getting a bit less noticeable and the wrinkles around my eyes lessening.  But I also had a lot more pimples and after a few days of using the deep recovery lotion at night, I would get dry white flaky stuff on my face the next day.The third step was a single-use mask covered with a lot of moisturizer, which is stretched onto your face and left for at least 15 minutes.  The moisturizer was fine but I didn't enjoy the cold wet oogie feel of the mask while it was on.The biggest difference I noticed with this Definity treatment was that my makeup went on easier and nicer than before.  My skin was smoother and the makeup looked more uniform.  But like I said, after just a few hours I got what looked like dry skin flakes on some parts of my face, yet my face didn't feel dry at all.  That went away a day after I stopped the deep recovery stage.It's not a bad moisturizer series, but I think I would prefer to have a single daily or nighttime moisturizer than do a separate 2-week stint, especially after using that mask.",4
"I was very happy to receive this product. I like rhinestones and the amount is quite charming for the price of $1.20 which is what I thought I paid. However, I found that I had been charged $2.85 instead of $1.20 and free shipping. Aw...booI hate it when that happens.",3
"I have thin long hair- After washing I apply and comb through.. I also use with a root spray but have used alone and still have the great effects of more body in hair! For the price you can't beat this product, I have added to my holy grail of products. I recommend to anyone who has thin hair!",5
"I love using this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel totally soft while keeping me protected from the sun. It is easy to apply, I usually pump three times and spread it on my face with 2 motions in the morning, then I use it again a few hours later if I have plans to be in the sun and use 2 pumps worth. That seems enough. I love its super pleasant smell and great texture. I recommend it to anyone looking for easy year-round sun protection.",5
"This product has great reviews but it did not work for me. This is not simply a Knot today, this is never again.I am a mix of Japanese and Black and my hair is very curly.For me, this product does no better than using a shampoo/conditioner combination like Pantene and comb/detangle while washing your hair. Plus it's cheaper.I left the product in my hair like the instructions said and it made my hair limp.I always use Paul Mitchell's super sculpt lotion to define my curls and leaving both products in my hair was too much.The search continues...I would not re-purchase this product.",2
"This is a great deal! These usually run close to $8 in stores, so when I saw the 3 pack had savings, I had to snatch it up. One for me and the other 2 for my friends with birthdays coming up soon. I've always used the Hawaiian Kukui 18 oz, but always wanted to try another scent. This one is perfect for summer. Its not overwhelmingly strong with coconut like some products can be. It is less oily than the Hawaiian Kukui one. If your skin is dryer, than do the Hawaiian Kukui scrub. If your skin isn't dry and you're more prone to breaking out because of added natural oils, then try this one. Exfoliates just as well as the Hawaiian Kukui version. Skin is left soft, smooth and lightly scented. Shouldn't clash with other lotions and perfumes you may wear.",5
"There are so many uses listed for rose water. I use it for the pretty scent. It's pleasant and light, not weighed down like perfumes. It dries very quickly, so I don't feel any moisturizing effects, but there is a tingle of toning.I only wish the bottle was not open mouth. It would be so much easier to apply if there was a smaller drip spout or spray pump. If it had a spray pump, I could spritz this all over. As it is, I use a cotton ball, but a spout or other dispenser would be much appreciated.This product was provided for review by InstaNatural.",4
"This product helped my eyelid to go back where it was. Suddenly I lose my double eyelid line every once in a while. But with this product, when that happens I know what to do to make it come back.",4
"TheAxe Spiking Glue Spiked Up Lookhas been my go-to hair gel for awhile now, and I love it.  But they make all sorts of hair gels, so I thought I would give this ""Axe Styling Gum Messy Look"" a try. Who knows?  Maybe I am more ""Messy"" than ""Spiked Up.""Nope.  There is a definite difference between the two hair gels.  The ""Glue"" is much stronger than the ""Gum.""  I tend to wear my hair spiked up a little, and while the ""Spiking Glue"" is good for the day--it keeps my hair straight up for hours--the ""Styling Gum"" eventually wilts.  I guess you could figure that out from the name, but a comparative experiment made sure this wasn't just marketing.I did like the ""Gum.""  It has a consistency of snot, for lack of a better comparison, and is easy to apply.  It works best on damp hair, rubs right in, and doesn't leave any residue. You have to give your hands a good scrubbing after you use it, because it is sticky!One of the worst (of best, depending on your opinion) parts of Axe product is the smell.  I personally wish this were scent-free. But as it is the smell isn't too overwhelming.  I have smelled worse from Axe.Even though this isn't the product for me, it works great if this is the strength you are looking for. Axe makes great hair product. I don't see the need to use anything else.",5
"When it comes to shampoo I'm a bit fussy.  I have added this product to two others that are favorites of mine.  I like to use them alternately.  I love Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo because it feels great (the Tea Tree oil in it is refreshing), and I like Fructius's anti-dandruff product.  The Clean Men Scalp Therapy really works well in reducing dandruff and leaves my hair really clean and manageable.  It has a luxurious feel to it.  My only negative is that the label claims that it has mint, but you wouldn't know it.  You can't smell it or feel it when shampooing. I'm not sure exactly what makes this a man's shampoo.  My wife likes it as much as I do. Of the bazillion shampoos on the market this is one that, in my opinion, stands out as one of the best.",4
I love the way this product feels on my skin.  I apply it right after washing and rinsing my face each morning and night.,5
This is a great tool. You won't need any other file/buffer. Does a great job and the surfaces do not peel off. They actually stay on and last. Like that the one tip has a point to clean under nails. I wish I had known about this type of tool decades ago. I didn't know one can achieve a smooth nail surface. I am so glad to have found this. I ordered a second to keep at work for breaks.,5
"Everyone once to remain youthful looking. Smooth, bright, clear skin is the goal essentially for most women; myself included.  For one week I added one additional step to my daily skin care routine: Vitamin C Serum.  After thoroughly cleansing my face I put on a thin layer of Vitamin C Serum.  This Serum is light weight, not greasy and smells nice as well.Although I currently have no wrinkles (knocks on wood) I do have a few blemishes.  Over the course of the week I did notice some of the blemishes caused by pimple scarring started to diminish a little in color so that was good.  The serum also tightens the skin as well but not to the point that your face is tight and dry like some astringents do.  Overall it was a pretty good experience and I will continue to use it in my everyday routine.",4
"I don't like heavy foundations, at all. I've been trying to stick strictly to bare minerals, but in the desert heat that I live in it's impossible for the minerals to stick to my dry skin. This moisturizer is the perfect remedy! The coverage isn't total, but that's what I love most about it! It minimizes flaws so you don't look like you're trying too hard, it really makes your skin look natural. The light reflectors are nice too because they give my skin that youthful dewy look. I tone it down a bit with my bare minerals powder, but it's nice to feel like your skin looks healthy, and that's exactly what this product does.Also, I never felt that this moisturizer was too thick. One pump gave me total coverage and spread really easily. They only had medium in my store, and I have fair skin, but I still found it to blend really well with my skin color. I love, Love, LOVE this product!!!",5
"I've been using Proactive for years!!! I didn't have real bad acne, but now that I use it, I get a pimple maybe one every couple months. I love that it works so well but is not harsh on my skin, I was diagnosed with dermatitis about a year ago and the Proactive does not irritate it, and I have had to stop using a lot of things on my face since I got this dermatitis!! I love that they made the big bottles!!!! Has anyone tried their new formula that just came out recently? Is it better? Worse?? I wanted to say to, I don't use the other stuff like the toner or face mask, I just use the cleanser and keeps my face looking good!! :)",5
"Well, I was looking for a Vitamin C moisturizer that was paraben-free and this was it. I just got it, but it smells good, feels good and looks good. I got excited when I read all the natural ingredients. It might be akin to putting all-natural plants and herbs on your face; with the added benefit of Vitamin C and Coq10. I look forward to finishing this tub. Using this cream, combined with a healthy diet; I don't see how you can go wrong. I don't think that will be the case with this cream, and that is a good thing. I feel that maintaining youthful skin requires exercise, diet and good skin care. It can't be just one thing over the other. Of course, if you had oily skin as a teen, that will help as you age. However, moisturizer is critical. I like the way the product sinks into my skin. I will probably purchase it again when I run out.",5
"Deceptive marketing strategies, with the different labels and same ingredients. Save your hard earned money and spend it on something you deserve!",1
"Great color for the 'nude' color on the lips fad! It wasn't quite right on this 52 yr old white lady, but still was okay, so I gave to my 26 yr old daughter who'd been wanting to try the color. I know she rocked it and, of course, the staying power is awesome and I do use it in other colors.",5
"I don't like getting manicures, they always hurt more than they soothe me! I do my nails at home often, but I don't wear nail polish very much. I love they way they look when they've been nicely shaped and buffed.But, wow... just WOW. This Body Shop Nail Block is incredible. My nails are so smooth and shiny they look like glass. They look like they've been painted clear.The nail block was very easy to use and worked very quickly also. I would definitely buy this again. In fact, I bought two to start with, and I anticipate never being without one of these things again. Highly, highly recommended for smooth and shiny nails!",5
"This is the only eyeliner i will wear, and they do not sell it in the small town that i live in. i have tried all kinds of eyeliners, from drugstore brands to high end brands and i still keep coming back to this. I own the brown and the black. the brown is great....does not smudge and stays in place all day. The black is good, super dark, but it tends to smudge and smear as the day wears on. An easy fix for that is to apply powder directly under your lower lashes with a small eyeshadow brush.Highly recommend!!!!!!",5
"I've bought all kinds of products looking for something to help my acne prone skin.  It's hard to believe this gem was hiding right up the street for literally a fraction of the price I've paid for less effective products.I bought this after reading the reviews here.  I knew something good was happening as soon as I put it on.  It tingles in a pleasant way and you can actually feel it working.  It took about 30 minutes to dry completely.  I rinsed it off and my face feels CLEAN. There's no other word to describe it.  It really feels like my pores are breathing a sigh of relief.  I don't know that my face has ever felt this unclogged.  A lot of the gunk in my pores and on the surface of my skin has been sucked up and rinsed off.  My skin feels smooth and soft.  It is a little dry and tight, but I know my skin will eventually adjust to that and the dryness will lessen after a few uses.It's a little tough to rinse this stuff off because it's thick and clings a bit.  I recommend using it before you shower.  That'll be the fastest and easiest way to get it off.The smell is also quite strong and minty.  Some people will be turned off and/or simply unable to stand it.  I started getting a headache after a while from the smell, but it was well worth suffering through.  (At least it's not as bad as Mario Badescu drying mask, which smells like tires.  I actually had to shove balls of tissue up my nostrils with that one.)All in all, read the reviews and believe them.  I hope the effects continue and that it doesn't stop working after a while.  We'll see.  I'm already looking at other Queen Helene products, which you'll notice also have stellar reviews.",5
"One was broken when I got it in the package, but what do you expect for so cheap. They stay in my hair and lite up/changed colors. My friend with straighter hair had problems getting it to stick in her hair.",4
My eight year old has some curl to her hair I was hoping this would help her hair bring the curl back but all it did was make it seem dirty and weighed down. I didn't mind the smell but even when I used just a bit it didn't work.,2
"My hairdresser recommended this product, and upon trying it, I was pleasantly pleased.  It works great, doesn't weigh hair down (at least not mine) and helps smooth my coarse curls.  I have used &#34;gel&#34; products from other manufacturers and like this MUCH better.  No more gel for my hair.  :)",5
i have no complaints does what it sets about to do. i would recommend it. however the metal scraper scratches your plates. Well don't buy if this will be a problem for you.,4
"I work in a metal shop and I get my hair pretty much filthy daily, I use the Fekkai boost shampoo, but on the weekends I like a nice deep cleaning to get a really clean. .... very clean actually squeaky clean !Just a little bit is needed, ( so even though it cost more it will last a pretty long time ) it lathers up great and rinsed out very easily.Oh and it smells great also :)*****Jim",5
I LOVE this blow dryer!  It dries my hair so fast but without damaging it.  I highly recommend this one and hope it lasts a long time.,5
"I have not used the &#34;art sticks&#34; yet, but I have used the beautiful stones, and tweezers make it SO much easier to pick up and place wherever you want.  Would/will buy these stones again, if I ever run out.  There are so many I don't see this happening anytime soon.  Thank you!",5
"This does just as it promised to do, and is going to make my legs look great for swim suit season. We all have that fear that our legs will not look good in that bath suit. This takes away that fear.",4
"I know that the product is supposed to blend in with your skin, but it didn't really give my skin that even look from where your face is red, etc. I could've gotten the same effect with lotion. I expected more from it, and since I used it I won't be getting my $6 back.",2
"I bought the KONAD nail stamper kit B with these as a n addition, the designs are great for funky french designs, practice makes perfect though.",5
The first thing I did when I got it was wash it. It shed a few strands but not a lot. The brush picks up blush/bronzer well. You only need to put product on the very tip and it applies so smoothly. I love this brush the quality and price are outstanding. I have washed several times and do not have an issue with shedding. If you want a quality brush at a great price then go for this.,5
"I rated it high because it is waterproof, but it is difficult to apply and is very light needing careful reapplication.  I will continue to look for a better waterproof eyeliner, which most that say they are, are not; but will use this one until I find one I like better.  Also, it came without any plastic covering or box so I was a little concerned about the sterility of it, but took the risk and used it without any eye infection.  It was a risk however.  I would recommend that Avon put this in a sealed wrapper.",4
"I wasted my two bucks...should have spent it on a vending machine.  I tried to use it.  It doesn't open right and when you pinch the lash, it's hard to apply. I would not recommend.  Needle nose tweezers would be better",1
"I loved this color from the bottle but when applied to my fingernails, it looked cheap. It's just a personal preference but I wouldn't buy it again.",1
"I got this travel size deodorant as a backup in-case I needed a little refresh in the afternoons. It worked, but the smell is way too strong. It was more of a chemical smell than refreshing cucumber. I stopped using because it would begin to burn my nostrils. Replacing a foul odor for another tear-jerker is not what I want. I am using a natural deodorant now with a mild smell.I'm giving this product 2 stars because it was cheap, and it did keep me dry. It's not getting more stars, simple because the smell was nauseating.",2
"I am not a huge fan of the scent of these bars; however, I do like how they work.  In the shower it feels like  a regular bar of soap and at first I was afraid that it was going to leave my skin feeling dry and tight.  This is the first soap product I've used that made me feel like I didn't even need to use lotion afterward!  I've only used it a couple of times, and the acne on my back and shoulders looks better than usual, too.  I'm crossing my fingers that it will only get better with continual use!",4
"I really like this brush. I have been using it for months with no issues. Not even one bristle falling off to my knowledge. Would definitely buy again.The small one is good for carrying around, but I basically just use the big one.",5
"I bought this sponge after going to a Korean spa where I got a fantastic body scrub. Of course, this sponge is hardly doing the work of what they did but I wanted something that wouldn't fall apart after a few uses and the reviews were very good! So far extremely durable, very nice on the skin, and very foamy and spongey. Perhaps I was thinking it might be slightly less soft but I love it - it is not supposed to a scrub, poor thing, it is doing what it is advertised to do and I give it a good rating! Thank you!",4
"These are NOT nail art paints, so don't be fooled! They are, LITERALLY, fabric puff paints with the labels taken off and a silver &#34;nail art&#34; sticker stuck on.  The paint will peel off your nails within an hour or so of them being dry, even with a top coat! These were NOT made for nail art, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Thankfully the seller I used felt bad and refunded my money, as well as removing this product from their inventory completely.  I suggest all sellers do the same and let the fabric paint people have them.  :(",1
"I have been using this product since Sept. 27, 2010. So far very little, if any change. I will give it another 2 weeks to see if my lashes grow. It does make my eyes a little dry but have had no other negative side effects. I am disappointed that my lashes have not grown like the other posters have. I am beginning to think it is a waste of money and should try something else.",2
"Let's face it. Kids hate to get their face wet. So having to shampoo, rinse and then condition and rinse again can make for a difficult time in the bath or shower.I like having the shampoo and conditioner in one and while it doesn't work quite as well as using two products, overall, it does make life easier.The smell is kind of like the Lifesaver coconut pieces. Not too obnoxious or overpowering, pleasant and not too sugary as some kid's shampoos can get.A good product that gets the job done.",4
"If you're doing Harmony Gelish nails yourself, this is step 3. You'll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.",5
"My husband loves this stuff, applies it everyday.  Much cheaper locally though - $9.99 minus coupon.  Great sunblock!",5
This mascara is very nice. It made my lashes look very long and very dark.  There was minmal flaking when I wore it for more than 15 hours but none on shorter days.  It went on smoothly and easily.  I used 2 coats for every day and 3 coats for evening.  No problems with clumping!!!  And that's a real plus.,4
"I bought a book on Amazon calle &#34;How to Look  Expensive&#34; --which should tell you all you'll ever need to know about me. :(. Anyway, the author suggested wearing a coat of Essie Pop Art Pink and a coat of Rock Candy, which I dutifully ordered and brought to my manicurist. (The evidence keeps piling up, doesn't it?). She normally uses OPI, which I've been fine with, but she noted how much better Essie was, smoother and shinier.  These colors leaves nails a soft, natural, shiny pale pink.  Very elegant.  If they were to chip, I doubt anyone would notice.  (Mine don't chip because my manicurist is that good).  To me they look a little plain, and I  ussually cover them with a coat of blue or purple a few days before going back for another manicur, just to relieve the boredom, but I seriously recommend Essie and these two colors are great.",5
"Not bad. Smells really good. It works pretty well too. I kinda like it. However, it's packed too simply for me.",4
"The shadows apply very easily, have a nice pigmentation and look really great. My favorite of these are the purple and emerald smokes as they make my brown eyes pop. These are my new favorite eye shadows my only complaint is that they don't have much of a staying power, so if you use these, be sure to prime before hand.",4
"I've been using this particular color for almost 10 years now. Though I would like it to be more ""blue"" than black, it is a good quality color. The gloves can easily rip so I would be careful when using them, they are also made to fit small/medium hands and do not stretch at all. I have small hands, so the gloves even they tend to rip once in a while and get dye between my fingers. Over all the dye itself is rich and lasting in your hair. I use regular shampoo after rinsing out the dye and before using the small pack of conditioner that way my pillow case at night doesn't turn black but that's just my preference.",4
"These arrived today and I started doing my trim and I accidently cut my finger and I didn't think much about it until my finger was covered in blood! I couldn't believe how sharp these are.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for (minus the cut), because the sharper your scissors are, the less likely your hair's ends will fray and turn into splits. This is what I am trying to avoid, as I'm growing out my hair.  I have  pair of $20 barber shears, and these Fromm scissors are much better.  I cut my hair dry, and with the cheaper scissors, I hear a ""crunch"" sound when I cut my ends.  I don't hear anything when I cut with these.  They are worth the money; I just hope I didn't dull them by cutting my finger :)",5
"Overall, I really like using this soap on my face. It lathers well, is unscented, and leaves my face clean without overdrying.I am a 30 y.o. female who in the past 2 years has been struggling with moderate acne flare ups (as are a lot of other people, I'm finding!). I have, like all the others, been trying EVERYTHING to get rid of this crap and make my skin beautiful again, but I still get pretty nasty acne - mainly on my chin and around my lips. I finally decided I would try to go the natural route and stop using all these chemicals.Anyway, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks, and I don't think it's either helped or hurt my acne thus far. Perhaps if given another week or so, I will see a change. Time will tell.I have never had an issue with large pores, so I can't comment on whether or not it minimizes them. One thing I can comment on is that my t-zone was getting pretty oily for awhile, and I do think that something in my 'regimen' has helped with that.Currently, my 'regimen' is (listing this so you can see what else I'm doing in addition to this soap):A.M. - Wash w/ this soap, use Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil pads (think they help w/ acne prevention a little), spot-treat zits w/ tea tree oil, spritz on Burt's Bees Rosewater & Glycerin toner, apply Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, and my makeup (trying to go as oil-free as possible w/ that).P.M. - Wash w/ this soap, apply Bragg's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar topically, spot treat w/ tea tree oil, spritz on the rosewater (see above), and moisturize. ALSO... every other day I am using Aztec Secrets Indian Healing Clay, which draws all the nasty gunk out of your pores & makes your skin feel radiant.I have just begun the straight up vinegar topically, but I did the clay mask & vinegar last night, and I think I see some minor improvement today.Moral of the story, I WOULD reccommend this soap & really like it; I'm just not so sure about the acne healing properties just yet. But good luck to ya!",4
"I've tried tons of Shampoos and conditioners.  Even the more expensive brands like Aveda.  It all starts out the same.  My hair looks great for the first few days or maybe a week...then...all down hill.  My hair starts to look weighed down or greasy and lifeless.  There is no volume or shine.  I took a leap and decided to try Acure Organics, Pure Mint and Echinacea Stem Cell.  It's been about two or three weeks and I am still pleasantly surprised.  My hair feels full, soft and has it's natural wave back.  It has shine and volume.  I'm hoping with all my heart that I continue to be surprised.****UPDATE 7/8/13****Just wanted to give everyone an update.  I have been now using this shampoo for about 2 months and I still love it.  This NEVER happens.  By now I've most likely stop using a shampoo and would have 2 or 3 different shampoos sitting in the shower.  This shampoo makes my hair feel full, soft and I've had many compliments on the shine.  I have red-auburn hair naturally so it's very difficult to find a shampoo that helps maintain color.  This shampoo definitely does.  I've even notice the red being more vibrant.  My hair continues to have a nice natural wave to it that has been gone for years or would flaten when dried.  I use the conditioner only a couple times a wk so I've got a pretty full bottle still...which is awesome.  I've gone through 2 bottles of shampoo as I often wash my hair twice in the shower.  I've also been putting organic Sesame Oil in my hair at night and washing it out in the morning.  This works very well and my hair loves it.  I will definitely be buying another bottle.  The only bad thing I have to say is that my local whole foods store now has a smaller bottle of the shampoo.  I believe I originally bought a 12 oz bottle along with the 12 oz conditioner.  Now they only have an 8 oz bottle but it's the same price.  I was pretty disappointed in that but not enough to stop buying it.  Still 5 stars!!!",5
"The colors look pretty but I could not get them to be streak free when I applied them, perhaps I am just not good at this though.",2
Does not smell like Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo/conditioner set and is a pretty greasy conditioner. I use maybe less than a teaspoon of this for my shoulder length haircut and still feels like I didn't wash it out enough.The smell is more like a perfume/cologne/old lady/potpourri smell :(,1
"i do freelance makeup and needed more brushes but didn't want to spend a fortune on expensive brands. I was leery at first about getting these brushes cause the price was so cheap but i watched a couple reviews on you tube and decided what the heck i'll just get them. I was excited when they arrived. First the packaging was very nice and secure. Some reviews complained about the smell of these brushes but i think it was just the case they came in and not the brushes themselves. Although I don't use the case the brushes came in (because I use another brush holder) it is still very nice and looks and feels good. Next about the brushes. There are so many brushes to choose from. There is a brush for everything you need: Powder, foundation, concealing, eye shadow, brows etc. Also the brushes are super soft and applies makeup very well. I just did a brides preview yesterday using these brushes and at the end the bride loved how her makeup turned out. I plan on buying 3 more sets of these brushes: two for me and one for my mom. I highly recommend these brushes.",5
"I have spent a small fortune on face creams.  I have very nice, but sensitive, skin and am well into middle age, warding off lines and wrinkles.  Most of the products that I've used regularly have been very expensive.  I've tried the cheaper stuff - namely, Olay - but found that it left residue on my skin, so that I was greasy, not glowing, and felt covered with chemicals.Nonetheless, having read great reviews of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, I gave it a try.  I've been using it for less than a week, but already see a difference.  My skin is clear, and as clean and healthy looking as when I use the $250 La Prairie retinol product.  My skin is tighter and the lines are less apparent (still there, but there is no ""withered"" look around the lips, if you know what I mean).I have just stocked up on the night and day creams and ordered the serum and eye treatments.  These products are going to leave my skin looking great, while saving me a ton of money.  I don't know how Neutrogena did this for $24 - less on Amazon - but Neutrogena did.",5
I used this in conjunction with the matching conditioner. I live in Arizona in an area with extremely hard water and my hair shows the effects. Using this once a month has helped clarify and chelate the minerals that build up with the use of hard water.,5
"I have hip-length, very straight, fine, medium thick normal hair. My daughter has hair to the middle of her back, wavy with some curl, medium coarse, super thick dry hair.We don't ever detangle using a boar bristle brush. We get tangles out using a wide-toothed pick.What we do use this brush for is styling when our hair is dry. It leaves both of us with very shiny, very smooth hair. We clean the brush once a month with shampoo, and comb it out quickly after every use over the sink. This has kept it in great shape. Neither of us use hair products, so if you do use mousses, gels, etc, you may want to wash your brush more often, possibly with a clarifying shampoo.",5
"A bright medium pink with lots of sparkle, not for your french manicure.  Has good lasting ability, I can get at least a week to 2 weeks without too much chipping.",5
"It does a good job of polishing my nails. There are 4 sides to it and they all are very durable, one buffer lasts for me ~3 mnth",5
This Mask is beautiful! It has this thick muddy feeling to it and also a real mud color! Right after applying I get this tingling sensation on my skin which probably comes from the Eucalyptus Oil. If you have sensitive skin this might not be the right choice.Well I have oily skin and my skin feels super balanced after applying this mask! I feel like my skin gets cleansed from deep within and enjoyed this mask a lot! Why is mud from the Dead Sea special? The Dead Sea is 1400 feet below sea level and the lowest pint on the earth's surface. The healing properties of its mineral- rich mud are known for centuries. I find it very unique to know that I am applying real mud from ground of the Dead Sea!This facial mask is for sure for everybody who has oily skin and if you have any impurities and for those I recommend this for sure!,5
"I love the Wet N Wild matte series of lipsticks so much that I just wanted to try this Red Velvet, but it's a little too much... I don't know, I just don't like it. It doesn't go well with my skin color. I think I'm just still too stuck on the Sugar Plum Fairy color.",2
"Love the shade for my pale skin and goes on smoothly.  I love this brand, great quality. Shipped on time.",5
I took these to my local nail tech where I get my nails done because I have never used these  before and when she showed me how to use them it came out really neat.She loved playing with them too.,5
"Both my daughter and I tried this for a few days and loved it.Pros:BRUSH: The brush is easy to use--it has many tiny bristles on it that make the mascara easier to put on without getting globs of black liquid sticking lashes together.LIQUID: The liquid itself seems to dry quickly once applied. My biggest problem with mascaras in the past has been the spread of wet liquid onto my upper eyelid once I open my eye, but that didn't happen with this mascara.RUBBING: I tend to rub my eyes a lot, and I expected the mascara to spread with the rubbing. Again, that didn't happen.WASHING: Both my daughter and I washed it off at night in seconds. Even without soap, it came off very easily, and my eyelashes didn't sport that ""I wore mascara last night"" look.Cons:PACKAGING: The packaging is not very exciting or colorful. I assume Covergirl wanted the promote the natural ingredients in the product by giving the bottle a ""green"" look, but it ended up looking like something from the seventies instead of from this decade. I thought Covergirl would have a little more creativity than that. Nevertheless, the bottle is a regular size and easy to fit into a makeup purse.",5
I shave in the shower like a lot of gents ... But this thing is big and obtrusive ... Just not good,1
It keeps my skin moisturized. I even apply it at the bottom of my feet after shower while my skin is still damp. I will reorder again.,5
"I use this for dry skin, itchy seasonal allergy skin, and for eczema. I have also used this on my 3 year old niece and it really helps calm down her itchy skin. If you or your child has dry skin or allergies I would recommend having a box on hand at all times.",5
I have been using this soap for over 2 months and I have not had 1 single breakout..which is a first for me..I usually have to change products very regular but not this soap..,5
I thought it was double sided but it's not. However it still works great even after a few stampings. And it is pink - some reviewers thought it was a white one.,4
"I bought this nivea lotion for dry skin because in the winter time my skin tends to get extremely dry and this lotion keeps my skin from drying out. This lotion keep my skin smooth and soft not only in winter but all year round. I think it is the shea butter and the vitimin E in the lotion , that works wonders on the skin. The lotion is fast absorbs and dont leave your skin feeling sticky and greasey. The texture is not thick and not watery, it is in the middle and feel just right on the skin. This lotion keeps my hands nice and soft, when I tell this work wonders on my skin, my skin is now baby soft and not ashy looking. I recommend this for anybody who want to have smooth and soft skin.",5
"I bought this reading good reviews, and was not disappointed. I am not very demanding when it comes to a base coat. This one goes on smoothly, has a bit of a shimmer which is good if you don't want to apply polish. Overall my polish goes on well and stays for at least 1 week if not more.",4
"Not sure if it works or not but judging by the box you would think it was the size of a tube of lip gloss. Not the case at all. Its extremely small , I only used it 3 times and I think I only got 2 more uses out of it. Smells like vicks vapor rub lol but it was delivered fast so that&#8217;s a plus. I don&#8217;t notice a difference but like I said I only used it twice. I&#8217;ll use the rest and update my rating. Oh I only used half of a pea size amount under each brow. if thats helpful.",3
"This blush goes on nicely and gives a subtle glow. I have to use it over a darker blush as the blush is very light when applied. I have fair to medium skin. For a very fair skin, there would be no need for another blush.I like it because it adds a pretty glow that is not as brown looking as some of the bronzers.",4
This product is different in a good way. I like it and would buy it again.,4
Perfect for traveling.,5
"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at the department store. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is a very good, basic cleanser that can be used by anyone. I like the packaging and feel that this is appropriate for male or females. However, this is not worth the money. You'd be better off with Purpose Gentle Cleansing for like $5.",3
"I would not know if this product makes your hair grow faster, but I am definitely sure it makes your hair softer. I am asian and I like that it relaxes my hair a bit. I don't use that much, only a few drops which I apply it everywhere besides my scalp. Also, I won't really suggest using it everyday since it does make your hair very oily, once every 3 days would be ideal.",4
This is great and healthy for my hair.  I love it and it makes my curls feel really really soft.,4
I'm 51 years old and have been using this daily. I use it after removing my make-up at night before my moisturizer and also in the morning when I wake-up. I refreshes your skin and leaves it super clean ready for the next step. The bottle is huge and the pump prevents from over using and spills. My skin looks amazing. Great product.,5
I have been a fan of tanning beds for a long time.. but I dont want to get sick from them so I stopped going in them... all the self tanners I have tried previously made me look oompa loompa orange or they were that and streaky... I saw the reviews on this and so I bought it... I love this stuff... gets you looking like you went somewhere nice and hot and spent your whole time laying out when really you just spent a few minutes rubbing the fake bake flawless in... It was easy you cant screw it up... I will continue using this product :),5
"This is the kabuki brush everyone needs and wants.  The thick bristled end is a rounded oval shape and the bristles are super lush thick and soft.  I would have sworn the bristles were sable except it says they are synthetic on the package.The handle is nice and thick and the brush is very full and has just the right texture, soft and luxurious but with body enough to stand up to any type of foundation including liquid, cream or powder.I use this with my Lancme powder foundation.  I also use it with my Vincent Longo Water Canvas makeup and it is perfect for that.  It applies smoothly and evenly with this, and I can blend perfectly with it.  I also use this with my pans of powder blush.  I haven't had a brush that blends as well as this one does.The handle on this is extra thick, and feels good in the hand.  That end with the bristles is really thick and while the bristles aren't long, they are very fully packed in and thick and springy yet soft.  I haven't had one bristle fall out yet.This looks and feels like a high end makeup brush but the price is about half of what this should cost.  I want more of this brand's makeup brushes.  This is an excellent quality makeup brush.*Note that I was provided with a sample for review.",5
There's no other product in the market better than this one. And it is true that in thin oily hair it does not get sticky... I absolutely love it and would advise anyone to buy it. Try to use after you dry your hair and you will see it with an incredible shine!,5
"I love this line of products. I have not yet found a Simple product that I have not loved. Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is exactly what it says. It is simple, not full of fru-fru nonsense you don't need. It is refreshing, leaving your face feeling cool and clean. It does not strip your skin of all moisture. It did not leave me with that uncomfortable ""tight"" feeling I sometimes get with other over-drying facial washes. It lathers nicely, and rinses clean. Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is just like all of this line's other products... simply awesome!",5
"This stuff is STONG! I won't give a detail review-others have done better, plz read those! (Directions & tips on 'How To'!)This was not my 1st peel, I'd used 40% Glycolic Peels, AHA Peels for about a year before attempting this TCA Peel&#8230; I knew this would be different/more strong than the ones I'd used before & I was ready/forewarned!I followed the directions completely, the only thing that differed slightly was I wasn't exactly sure about the 'Frost'&#8230; When time time ran out, my face didn't look exactly like it should have! I looked more like a Zombie, actually! My face had more of a blueish tint. I was afraid to leave the peel on any longer, though. As I did NOT want to end up in ER; I ran to the sink & ended up splashing the peel off hysterically! @ 1st I thought I'd over-reacted, should've left it on longer! Then-- I'm glad I did, as apparently that blue tint WAS the 'frost' they were talking about! 5-6 days later, my face became leather-like, started cracking, then peeling.After which, everything happened as promised! Nice, soft, new skin beneath! I am waiting the 5-6 weeks until using again. If you use AS DIRECTED this can be a wonderful tool. The AS DIRECTED is the important part. Anything else is @ you're own peril. Good Luck! (BTW-Plenty of good tips on other posts!)",5

"This brush is wonderful! I have very thick, course,curly hair that I like to blow out straight. It smooths out my hair and glides through it easily. When I saw the brush I had my doubts but gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I have hair that is hard to deal with and it was soft and pretty tame after using this brush.I would definitely recommend this brush!",5
I love this Gluten free nail polish; it is a beautiful color and fantastic for the holidays.  OPI never disappoints.,5
"This is my least favorite gloss. I would think that L'Oreal has high quality products, but this gloss is no better than the one I used to buy at 99 cent store. It tends to separate from the pigment and comes out as a clear liquid. Gross.",1
It moisten my hair without stripping out the natural oils and it really cleanse the hair.,5
I will admit that I am a first time stamping user. The thing that I didn't like about this product though is that the plate holder and the scraper stain with nail polish once it dries. The stamper is nice and didn't have issues picking up the design.,3
"Horrible salespersons are rude and talk down to you if you don't buy their product after they slap it on half your face. However, I was impressed with the results of their products. I am a 40 year old woman with very sensitive and dry skin, so I'm always hesitant to try new products since I have a tendency to have allergic reactions. These products did not cause any reactions, but they also didn't reduce, replenish or lift anything. This serum does absolutely nothing for my face. It is very overpriced, but Amazon prices are much more affordable. I'm not sure what industrial strength creams they used in the demonstration but the products that I purchased did NOT yield the same results. I will not purchase this product again.",1
"I read many of the reviews, which led me to purchase the scrub. I can say that I am  not a fan. I guess I prefer a scrub that has a stronger scent and one that is more ""greasy"" and leaves a shine on your body.  Thus, the reviews are correct in stating that it has a light scent and that it doesn't have a ""greasy"" feel to it. I thought I would like a scrub with such a description, however, I will need to go back to one that leaves a nice scent to your body like you just left the spa and one that leaves your skin glowing with a little sheen.",3
this is a great bb cream for if you have very fair skin. there is only one color and i am pretty light & it works for me just great. it has great coverage for a bb cream. the smell is very subtle & i use this everyday. i will definitely be buying this once this one runs out :),5
I love the color variety available in this set. As soon as I received this product I couldn't help but paint my nails and start to use the caviar design. It lasts a very long time and I always get compliments on my caviar nails.,5
"I am using the Obagi Nu Derm system and added this to help keep my skin protected during the day. It is smooth, feels lightweight and not greasy, has no fragrance and works great.",5
"I have the nickel finish model. The lamp is of sufficient quality at this price point - $62. Fit and finish are very good. Switch works just fine, and lightening is exactly what it should be. Any brighter and it would be harsh. It is intended to be used along with ambient lighting not as  singular illumination in a dark room.We have it in our bathroom and it does not fog up. I applied a thin coat of WD 40 to help with rust prevention and will continue that going forward.I'm happy with this purchase.",5
"Because it's oil based I don't use it more than once a week as it is somewhat harder to rinse out but with the hot blow dryer I use daily, and the hot dry heat in the house, this does rejuvinate my hair and add shine and silkyness to how it looks and feels. A little bit goes a long way so don't use too much...",5
"As a toner, the conditioner does its job. However it doesn't seem to condition well at all. The shampoo is very strong-smelling, actually the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner is intense.It's heavily perfumed, I'd describe it as a very chemical/floral scent or an extremely ""old-school grandmother"" smell. (No offense to any grandmothers out there!) That being said, this product does help with toning out yellow/brassy shades in blonde hair.If you leave the conditioner on for a few minutes you can really see the toning effect, however the formula of both the shampoo and the conditioner is very runny and hard to apply evenly. (Plus, the smell!) I find that my hair doesn't feel particularly clean after using the shampoo(and that terrible scent lingers on my hair forever afterwards). And it doesn't feel especially conditioned after using the conditioner. But, it DOES tone out brassiness. So at least there's that.(But, oh god, THE SMELL).",2
This mist sets the makeup and makes my skin look soft and supple. I highly recommend IQ Mineral makeup to anyone and the prices are unbeatable.,5
Gives my hair lots of Volume.  I am happy with all their products and have been only using WEN on my hair Since August of 2013...&#128077;&#128077;&#128077;,5
"I have thin eyelashes. Compared to other mascaras on the market, this took me at least 3 applications to get my lashes full and long like I like them.  Possibly its made for thicker lashes, but if you have thin lashes like I do, I would pass otherwise you will have to reapply many times. Also my normal mascaras last throughout the day. I applied this both days around 9:30am and when I got home around 7pm, it was almost like I hardly had any mascara on.. So I will pass for my eyelashes, but hopefully it will work on yours!",3
"BRIEF OVERVIEW: I have 4a/b type natural hair and after much consideration not really to do with pricing because I am a product junkie and have ordered way more expensive stuff that didn't work but more so based on reviews. So when I received a special offer in the mail for the WEN sample kit I ordered it and immediately called and opted out and cancelled the recurring monthly shipments they put you in when you sign up and had no issues. I ordered the Sweet Almond scent and have had it for over a month as I was waiting to try out some other products I had. In between that time and now I have read tons of reviews and to my dismay most of the reviews I read stated the Fig scent works best on black hair so I finally decided to just order the Fig from Amazon to see what works better. Most people have had great results the second time they used the product and since it's a new month I can now try something else and see if it works. So here is what I did:MY CLEANSING PROCESS:1. Detangled and separated my hair in four sections2. Pre-poo for a couple of hours(I always prepoo regardless of whether I shampoo or cowash)3. Rinsed with cool water as stated on the bottle for 2 minutes (this was a little strange for me as I always do my first rinse with warm water and last rinse with cool water by the way I actually used a timer because I wanted to follow instructions exactly so I can accurately state how the product worked following the directions)4. After rinsing I went to work on applying the product to each section. It recommends minimum 8 pumps for each section so I did 10 for the bottom half and 15 for the upper half since the front of my hair is thicker than the back. I did the left side with the Fig and the right side with the Sweet Almond. I had a spray bottle filled with cool water on hand so that I could spray my hair after applying and working the product through my hair and then I massaged my scalp for each section.5. I then put my deep conditioning cap on to allow product to sit on hair, it recommends minimum of 10-15 mins but it also states the longer the better so I left for a full hour.6. Rinsed each section with cool water7. Used the remoist mask treatment and left that on overnight and rinsed in the morning.8. After rinsing use 2 pumps of the fig cleanser and applied to my hair as leave in then I did my regular styling routine with moisturizing and sealing.RESULTS: I'm honestly shocked this stuff worked!My hair looked and felt better than before I used it. I am a product junkie and I have tried so many products so I was not expecting this stuff to deliver any good results like everyone else has been experiencing but here it is two days later and my hair is still soft! This is the first time I've used a cleansing product that actually left my hair feeling better than I expected. HOWEVER I must say that I really really really really love the way the Fig cleanser worked on my hair better than the Sweet Almond. The Fig cleanser had soooooo much more slip than the sweet almond and it gave me more of a tingling sensation when I massaged my scalp verses the Almond. I will use both cleansers and if I continue to have good results and end up repurchasing I will definitely be getting Fig cleanser not the Sweet Almond. Something else I will not be getting is the Remoist Mask Treatment. I actually liked the way my hair looked and felt better than BEFORE I put the remoist on so I will skip purchasing that.REVIEW: So for first time use this gets 5 stars as it ""suprisingly"" delivered what I was looking for, the Sweet Almond gets 4. I will continue to use the rest of the month and will monitor if I see any changes or differences (hair falling out as some have said) and give a final update on how good the product worked over a month's time.",5
So I bought this for my sister because I know she loves it along with tons of other girls I can't personally say how this product is but everyone I know loves it. An the shipping was great and very fast. 100% Authentic product.,4
"Goes with matte lipstock Madere and lip gloss Striptease.  It finishes off this look and is the glue that holds it all together.  Without the lip liner, the look is unpolished, but ok.",5
These are great! They are very nicely packaged and are double sided with all different sized balls. The colors are really nice to!,5
"I have kinky-coily hair and I live in Central Texas....that means my hair must fight extreme heat and moderate humidity most times of the year. Since going natural, my hair would break a lot in the summer until I discovered Kinky Curly Knot Today. This product has literally saved my hair and restored its texture. I highly recommend this product to anyone living in extreme weather environment--especially if you have naturally curly hair.",5
This hair serum is great! It is so good for you hair I put it in my hair while it's still damp everyday after my shower and it makes it so soft and smooth! I'm already out and I will definately be buying more!,5
This is an excellent sunscreen.1.They don't test on animals 2.It melts into one's skin without leaving a clown face look.,5
"I did just try this today, so, while I am not a seasoned user, I have tried it.  A  lot of reviews said it made your skin itchy.  It didn't make my skin itch.  Maybe a tiny bit; hardly noticeable, but just for a few minutes.  But it was fine. Nothing to bother about.  Also, it was not sticky; but dried very quickly on my skin.  It died make my skin dry, so I will shower it off and put on body lotion just like I always do after a shower.  If this stuff works, it's worth it!  I just wish I knew how much to use!I will keep you updated.  Thank you.",5
"This saves me the horrific time and experience of laying out in the sun and getting skin cancer.  I really do not like the sun that much, especially sun burn.",5
"Silver shatter is ugly...I wouldn't purchase it again. I've tried it on light and dark colors, shimmery and flat, and it's just barely noticeable. It's not even a nice looking silver color, it looks like melted metal over your nail...",3
"This sunscreen is great. It's not greasy, there's no scent, and it moisturizes my skin. If you're looking for a sunscreen to wear every day, look no further.",5
This is a pretty color.  I only gave it 4 stars though since it was a little too pink for me even though the color says lavendar.  I would still recommend it though.,4
"Never knew what Hair Glaze was  until I came across reviews on Amazon. I really Love this Glaze the first time I used it I saw immediate results SHINE! Anyway there are two ways to use this one is on dry hair and one is Shampoo and Condition hair while in shower run glaze through hair cover hair evenly from Root to tip leave on 3 minutes or loner than rise and style I personally prefer the weekly treatment with dry,unwashed hair same thing apply from root to tip leave on 20 minutes than shampoo and condition I wear a shower cap when I do the once a week treatment kick back and read a book.I am amazed how much shine I had and no Frizz and super smooth hair .This bottle goes pretty fast when doing this with dry hair but I see better results however everyones hair is different.This is Ammonia,Dye and peroxide Free and will not change the color of your hair I was afraid of that my first use but that wasn't the case.I am placing another order and hope Amazon always has this because I cant find this product any where.",5
"This cleanser is so soft and gentle I lack words for describing it. I use it in the shower and my skin feels moisturized and never dry after this. Doesn't break me out, very good for sensitive skin. A little bit goes a long way.",5
"This offers good moisturizing with the right balance of cleaning without drying my scalp (in fact, it does the opposite!) or making my curly hair too fluffy (as a lot of conditioning products do... it's not sexy). The smell is subtle, but it reminds me of a lumber store.",4
The smell is divine but the way it treats my hair is more then i could imagine i have been using WEN for aprox 2 months and never ever wanna go back to shampoo again....,5
"This is a ""simple"" and clean face wash.  It doesn't make any promises to make you look younger or clear up breakouts.  It is exactly what it is marketed as -- a basic face wash.  It didn't irritate my skin (and I use it after I work out at the gym, when my face has been in a pool or sweating and therefore sensitive).  It also has a light, clean smell. My skin didn't feel dry and it did feel clean after use.",4
"This product is exactly what it says, and I don't see any broken hairs yet (1 week using it now). Some advice: let it dry in plain air, dont put it back in the bag. If you put it in the bag, it wont dry (or at least, not in a timely manner).",4
Has a slight chemical smell but it is a good non-harsh scrubber.  I use this to refine the pores on the face.  One tube will last a very long time.,5
"I can't  imagine what hair needs volumizing if not fine straight hair, but this shampoo really doesn't work well for that kind of hair.  It feels rather luxurious - creamy & smooth - and it has a nice, light scent, but it's really too heavy for thin strands.  My hair is shiny, but limp (even limper than usual), and it has to be washed every day with this shampoo, rather than every other day, which is my normal habit. If you want an excellent, affordable shampoo for fine hair,Suave Professionals Volumizing Shampoo by Suave, 12.6 ozworks great.",3
"This mitt has a rough texture, which is good for scrubbing, but not keeping the soap foamy.I tried this with the Moroccan Black soap (olives and eucalyptus formula) which can get foamy if you use it in a specific way (See my review for how I use it). I also used it with a regular liquid bath/shower soap.When testing this mitt, I would take a hot shower, wet the mitt, turn off the water and apply the soap. The mitt did not hold the soap very well so there was hardly any foam and it felt like you were mostly scrubbing your skin with sand paper and water :( I think because the mitt does not consist of fluffy fibers or fibers that allow a lot of air pockets to hold the soap.Luckly I got this mitt when it was priced very cheap to try.",1
"I've been using the Trader Joe's tea tree shampoo and conditioner for a few years since I had heard that it was the same formulation as the Giovanni one. When I finished up my last bottle of the TJ's brand, I decided to get the Giovanni one -- and there is a world of difference!The TJ's brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing. My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn't leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.On days when I use this, I also use the matching Giovanni shampoo.This is also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don't use sulfates or silicones on their hair.Another reviewer mentioned that this ended up damaging her hair and her boyfriend's hair, so I'm worried about long-term use. Because of that, I've only been using this combo for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!",4
"If you are looking for shimmer, you wont find much here, but if you like a subtle eye shadow this palette is perfect for you. I love NYX products and I pair this with their nude eye shadow base to make the colors pop, and add their lose powder shimmer. Love it, but if you just get this palette you should still be happy, and the big mirror is also very helpful!!! Love it",5
"The handle on the brush is fine. I saw some reviews stating the handle is short. I guess you can say it's a bit short, but at least it has a handle versus Tangle Teezer so you can't complain there. I don't use brushes while my hair is wet. That's a one way ticket to hair loss (at least for me). If you're going to use a tool on your hair wet, use a shower comb or a wide tooth comb that's soft. Sometimes you get those wide tooth combs that are cheap, plastic and it's garbage. So a wide tooth comb like a Conair one for example (I have a Conair purple one I bought from Walmart I think a while back) would be good to use. Wide tooth combs will keep your hair from breaking off. Deep conditioners are good for your hair too, something that works for you. I use this brush on my dry hair. I have short, dry, thick and coarse hair. I've never used this wet. Use shampoo, cheap if you want, and hot water to clean it well. I really like this brush and I use it everyday.",5
"I am fair-skinned and often have trouble finding something light enough that covers the redness I have.  This definitely covers, better than anything else I've tried and it matches my skin tone perfectly.I really wanted to love this, but I could only give it four stars.  It is very matte and when I tried to use it as foundation on my normal skin it just looked dry and accentuated fine lines.  It also is too matte under my foundation, although if I am careful to keep to just the areas of red (nose and chin), I can get away with it.  It also lasts all day long.",4
"This product is designed to boost already colored hair. It does next to nothing for hair that hasn't been colored.It is easy to use, wash and condition like normal. Use a towel to press out the excess water and apply about a quarter sized blob of the product. Spread it from roots to tips, trying to get the product everywhere and evenly distributed. Leave it for at least three minutes and then rinse. That's it; red colored hair will be boosted nicely. If you have thin hair, the product will also stain your scalp. The red stain goes away after the next wash.The color boost lasts about a week.It is kind of complicated to figure out which of these colors to choose. The box has a list of color codes for different home applied colors. From the John Frieda website, this particular Glosser Warm Blonde should be used with shade names like: Golden, Honey, Caramel, and Beige.",5
"I like this when my knuckles get very dry.  It is kind of vasoline like.  I like the smell which is I think is slightly menthol, like vics vapo rub but not as strong.  It is a little greasy so I have to get it off of my palms.  But when I put it on it also works well to rub into my cuticles.",4
"This is a great concealer brush. I have pretty dark circles under my eyes, and this brush works great at concealing them. I've used it with both a heavier and a lighter concealer, and it works very well with both. I received 2 brushes, packaged separately. I love that it's eco-friendly and cruelty-free.I noticed another reviewer stated the bristles came out after soaking the brush in soap and water, but any brush's bristles would! You are never supposed to soak makeup brushes- it loosens the glue between the brushes and the tool. You're just supposed to wet the bristles (always point brush down while wet), wash with soap, and rinse. Repeat for brushes that are heavily soiled or caked with makeup. I have washed this brush a few times and have never had issues with bristles coming out.",5
"I am so disappointed with this conditioner.  The shampoo in this series is ok, but the conditioner made my wet hair feel gritty and dry.  It did not make my hair feel lush or soft after styling, in fact I broke a lot of hair off trying to run a comb and brush through it afterwards.  I had to pull all of the hair back in a clip because the end result was frizzy and wild.  Not at all what I expected from an Aveeno product.  Cannot recommend.",1
"This is really something that all women must have, easy to use, last longer and the quality OMG amazing,i will definitely keep buying when I'm run out of it!",5
Does it job,4
"First, like others have mentioned, mine arrived in a plastic wrap in a package with its lid open and shampoo all over the interior of the plastic wrap. Not only was it a mess to open.. but 1/3 the bottle was already gone. Next came trying the product.. so far 1 weeks time and I will update again after a month goes by. When I first put some on my hair and begain to lather I stopped and made sure I used the right bottle.... its like a cream, and doesn't feel like a shampoo normally would feel. I thought I grabbed the wrong bottle! I'm mixed on how the product feels, and thougth it would leave my hair hanging heavy from the feel of the product but it did not I have let my hair air dry and have blow dried it as well. Even with air drying I did feel some volumn to my hair. My hair is normally flat and I have used various products for volumne. However this product did not do any better then other products like Pantene, Herbel Essence, Paul Mitchel, and others. I tend to use various products and never the same shampoo when I run out. Its almost as if my hair gets use to a product and it no longer works well, so I mix it up.I do like the smell to the product and don't find it overwhelming as others suggested. I did not find it dulled my hair (I do have highlights)My hair did feel clean, not oily or dirty looking as others have experienced. Think this is a try it out and see kind of product. Everyones hair is so different so each review is based on the persons kind of hair really. My hair is normally not oily, but is flat and below shoulder length with highlights. I saw no major changes compared to other products so for that reason its OK. I do not like the cap to the bottle and again how its packaged. Nothing like getting a product and loosing 1/3 of it and having a huge mess..... perhaps if you want to try it try it at a local store.",3
"I use this stuff once a day, on most days. I have noticed that my eyebrows have started thinning over time, and it looks pretty awkward. I have very dark features, but my thinning eyebrows don't match well with the rest of my face. It's been about a month since using this product, and already I can see a difference. My eyebrows look way more full than ever before, which brings out my blue eyes. I am a satisfied customer",5
"Christophe Professional Glossing Shampoo claims to give your hair instant shine and UV protection for luminous hair.  It contains exotic Argan and Monoi oils that are supposed to soften your hair and protect styling damage and breakage. This lightweight salon formula smoothes the cuticle for glossy, shiny hair.  It comes in a 10 ounce bottle for $8.99.  The size of the bottle and amount of shampoo you receive is generous for the price.  It is not excessively expensive and you do get a rather nice size of product.  The shampoo is a light tangerine color and has a very light and lovely fragrance.  I have been using the product for close to two weeks.  But how it works is what matters.  I have noticed that my hair is shinier, but more than that is how my hair holds its style.  I use hot rollers and normally during the course of the day, the curl somewhat falls out, but I have definitely noticed with this shampoo how my hair stays curled all day long.  I have somewhat thin hair and it is shoulder length and I noticed immediately after just one shampoo how my hair holds the curl, looks bouncier and smoother.  My only complaint is that I would like to try a conditioner if there is one, as I always shampoo and condition together every day.  I like this product and I would recommend it.  For me, the product did what it claimed and the price is reasonable for a salon type shampoo.",5
Ordered for my husband who has to wear sunscreen daily.  It's light and greaseless so it's a winner for us.  Convenience of online ordering is so nice.  We will be ordering more.,4
"Our kids count on us to protect them from so many things and that includes sunburn.  When they are little it is up to the parent to make sure that they have a good sunblock on and that it's being reapplied when necessary.  One of the things I like aboutCotz Pediatric Spf 40is that it is good for sensitive skin.  When my daughter was little, she had eczema and finding a sunblock that wouldn't aggravate it wasn't easy. She is now older, but we there are still little ones in our family that face the same issues.  This SPF goes on without leaving a mess and so far hasn't caused any irritation on the sensitive little ones.  And while it is a smaller bottle, this is perfect for travel or to keep in a diaper bag or purse.",4
"My daughter and sister both have naturally curly hair. My daughter uses regular shampoos/conditioners that include silicones and sulfates. She used this dryer on her hair and it dried it without disrupting her natural curls and no frizz.  My sister uses only sulfate free ""No Poo"" products on her hair, only towel/air dries to avoid frizz and she also used this dryer and now wants one of her own. I was surprised because my sister has not used a dryer in many years because she can't find one that's affordable that will only dry her hair without frizz. They were both very impressed with this dryer. I did not try it myself because my hair is straight.",4
"Granted, every scent smells different in every person. That said, I love the smoky, woody heart of this scent. Up here in the Pacific Northwest, it's perfect all day, every day.",5
I have been scrubbing with this for a month usually 1-3 times a day and sometimes a day or two are missed. I have only done the right thigh so I can easily compare results. After a month I finally see results so I am doing both now. Very happy & highly recommend as I work in cosmetic surgery & even that is not a guarantee to rid cellulite.,4
I have a lot of hair and I can put it up and under that cap and it will keep it completely dry for my entire shower.,5
This winter was brutal. We were hoping to find a brush that wouldn't add to the frizz. I honestly noticed NO difference between using this brush and a normal brush- still lots of static,2
"First off, this is a great hooded dryer. I have used hooded dryers for over 20 years and this is close to beauty shop quickness drying.  I purchased it about a year ago and it dries my really thick hair quickly (about 20 to 30 mins) Second, the hood adjusts from the back (which I like) and is comfortable but be careful not to entangle your hair in the strings because it will pull it. Ouch! Third it is space efficient and easy to clean off hood and case with mild soap and water.Now let me say although I love this dryer, I am not sure as to why the hose disconnected from the base. I usually wrap the hose in its spot and roll the hood up and place it into its spot and close it and put away. I usually take it out just about the same. In my opinion, I was not too rough with the hose and I am not sure why it came apart so I just purchased another one. I will do a follow up review after another year to see if the same thing happens. I am leaving as 4 star because of hose disconnect problem. I think they should make the hose sturdy enough to not come apart so easily because it cannot be replaced or fixed easily. You will have to purchase a new unit :*(",4
I like this product.  It's foamy and it moisturizes well.  I don't really have wrinkles so I can't really say anything about its anti-aging ability but I do like the way it feels.  I use it as a night moisturizer since I have oily skin and don't need something like this during the day.  I do like the way it feels. It leaves my face soft.,4
"The good:+ The colors in this set are spectacular.  If you're a 'purple person' you'll be delighted.+ Shipping was lighting fast+ Comes with mat topcoat just for fun+ Very good priceThe bad:- The polishes are very thick and syrupy.  These are the only Kleancolor polishes I have, so I don't know if this is normal for Kleancolor, of it these are just old polishes that have been sitting in storage too long.",3
"The clippers aren't the best..but they do the job. the tools work well, such a good deal for the 3 items! Good Purchase.",4
"Bundle Monster ships quickly, so I had them in time for Halloween decorating. I just love the designs, something for every occasion. Just finished a Thanksgiving manicure and looking forward to what I'll be doing for Christmas. Bundle Monster plates are well-made and stamp perfectly almost every time. And the price is very reasonable. I will always buy Bundle Monster!",5
"You never really know if a product works or not, especially when it comes to wrinkle reduction. The serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there. It's an individual decision.",3
"I really hoped this would work out, because I don't want to pay $10 for essie or Orly's matte top coat. But this did not work out. It goes on thick and has streaks/bald spots where it won't go. I've tried on numerous brands, with and without top coats, etc. It simply isn't that good.It may ultimately just be worth it to get the more expensive brand, honestly.",2
not much else to say except it does what it should do which is hold a nail art disc into place for easier use. would recommend-jill,5
I haven't used this myself but I placed the order for two great-great grandmothers and they love this. They say it get rid of all sort of scars including acne(they lend it to their great grandson and he's happy about the product too). That's all that I can say.,5
"- Average price on Amazon, I wouldn't say this is a great discount, but its the correct product!- Been wearing Tommy cologne for a couple years- Not too strong, just enough of a fresh scent.- I'd try it at the store in person before ordering considering the price- Larger bottle is a better value",5
"Or as much of a pleasure as it's ever going to be! The clementine scent is just phenomenal.I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. At the time I bought it, the pump bottle was (and still is) out of stock. I had a Cuisinart foam container I wanted to use for the kitchen, so I bought the refill, sight unsmelled.I am SO glad I listened to my friend! She was so right about the scent. The foam (from the Cuisinart bottle) works great, and at this rate, these two refill bags should last a few years!I'm still going to both some more refills. Whenever I really love something, it's practically like the kiss of death for that item - it just disappears. Believe me, you do NOT want Method to discontinue this fragrance or dishwashing soap!",5
PERFECT,5
"This stuff hasn't completely removed the full-sized pieces of luggage sitting below my eyes,but it has certainly replaced it with carry-ons.I'm sold.",5
"Profoot's Pedi-Rock works well.  After about 1 minute of rubbing the edges of my right foot's heel, the callous was smoother and slightly softer.  The 'rock' is actually spongy, though it's firm enough to offer good resistance against my skin and its shape forms to the shape it's rubbing against, so a larger area is more evenly exfoliated.  With rigid exfoliating tools like files or pumice, skin particles become embedded between the hard granules that are removing the dead skin, degrading performance over time; the Pedi-Rock's softer texture allows better rinsing so that skin particles are more easily removed from the rock's surface, making it more effective the next time it's used.  The rock's shape makes it easy to grip and both narrow and wide ends make it versatile.My only criticism is that for those of us with deeper callouses, the Pedi-Rock's granules aren't large enough to provide efficient exfoliating, meaning I will have to use this product a great many times to rid myself of these callouses, although this appears to be a perfect grade for maintenance.Recommended.  4.5 stars.",5
It does not come with the amount says it dose (less)  its the size of the palm of my hand almost like the size of an thin iPhone it mostly bring the color black . You will need design tweezer to use this product to attach to your nail but happy with them they are a great size for special detail in nail,4
"Most facial sunscreens caused my skin to break out, which is very frustrating.  This was given to me by my dermatologist.  It is a great sunscreen, can be worn under makeup without an issue, and works well.  I would highly recommend it.",5
"Amazing! This holographic green is so pretty I wanted to wear it everyday. I'm not much of a fan of green, but holy smokes this was a crazy color. Hopefully I don't run out too fast, it's in my top 5 favorite polishes of all time. I get a crazy amounts of compliments on this.",5
Bought this item for my niece and when she received it the blush was broken.  They need to wrap this idem more securely.,3
"It is really goooooood! Mine arrived fast, was tossed over the fence and the container cracked a little. The product's benefits are whats described and more. Hair, skin, nails getting healthier with every use. My body feels really soft, smooth and light, it gives a warmth sensation that makes me relax. Gave my girlfriend a full body massage with this butter/ coconut oil combination, she felt so relaxed that I had to start some action before she fell asleep ;D. Oh, put some on your feet, it feels incredible. The oily sensation disappears after a few minutes as it is absorbed by the skin. The butter is not ivory white, kinda light yellow; has a nutty smell similar to cocoa, not strong, not rancid at all.All and All we are really pleased with this African Ivory Shea Butter/ black soap combination.Will definitively be purchasing again.",5
I have very dry and frizzy hair due to the special shampoo & conditioners I have to use because of an allergy to sulfates. I get very frustrated since my options are very limited and all the products tend to really dry out my hair. I was excited to try Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil for many different reasons. First I am not allergic to the spray and second it stats that it is a dry oil treatment. I hate oily hair and products that make my hair clumpy and oily.This product was super easy to use: Just pump 3 to 4 times and massage into your hair starting from mid length to tips. For me I have been using 2 to 3 pumps and that seems to be the right amount for me. Goes into my hair easily and doesn't make it oily at all. My frizz is way down as well! My hair now looks shiner (but not an oily shine way) feels softer and I don't have frizz head anymore.For the price and what this can do for me I have to recommend it to anyone with frizz hair or people who have to use special products that dry the hair out.,5
"For me the only thing that this does is dry my nails, and the bottle is so small. I personally dont like it and it does not remove the polish as fast as i expected for pure acetone, i wont be buying it agai!",2
"This product has done nothing for me but BURN my nails so bad. I have used many nail hardeners.. such as essie, opi, sally hansen and NONE of them have ever had this kind of effect on my nails. I used this when i took gel off my nails because they were so brittle and figured this may help, did nothing but burn my nails. I waited a few more weeks when they were not so thin and they got a little longer and stronger and still this product burned just as bad, if not worse. Its not even a little sting where you can just bear through it and it goes away, it is such a strong burning sensation that lasts for hours and it sometimes got so bad to the point where its hard to move your fingers and my fingers got swollen. There is even a warning on the bottle that says it may burn, and to remove it right away if it does. I seriously would NOT buy this product, its a waste of money and not worth the pain. I recommend the one by OPI. There's seems to work pretty well, hope this helped :)",1
"I love love love this stuff it helps my fianc&eacute; with his blackheads, my brother with his acne and me with keeping it glowing!! It clogs your drain so put warm water in a large bowl and wash that way and throw water outside!! Amazing product",5
"I've tried many different brands,expensive and not, and always end up back with this one. I'm allergic to everything but don't have an issue with this. I also have dry skin and this doesn't make it worse.",5
Best thing i bought well worth the money! i would recommend this  any one that loves to decorate with anything!,5
"having a blast using all the brushes. The small ones are great for doing 3d nail art with. Great price, got them before the expected delivery date and they seem like a great quality, definitely for the price. I recommend this product.",5
"Before you buy, the photo of the bottle is not the right color.  It's muted, almost a slight mauve tone to it.  It's a very nice subdued pink.  Check the CNC Shellac website for a better idea of the color.",5
"I do prefer the eye roller by garnier, but this one is almost as good. The major differnce between this one and the one by garnier is that garnier has caffeine. If you are looking for one to soothe your eyes in the morning without caffeine I would try this one OR if you have had issues with other eye products, this one is great for sensitive skin.",4
"I love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes.  I'm almost complete with the full set of these brushes, they have the best brushes for the best price - to me better than MACI love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes.",5
"A few years ago I was turned on to Frederic Fekkai products by a friend and have not looked back. I have color treated hair and I live in SUNNY and HOT San Antonio, Texas. My hair needs lots of help. I used this conditioner with a matching shampoo and conditioner. My hair is my ""trademark"" and always receives many compliments. Even though it may seem a little expensive, it only takes a little bit so one bottle can last a long time. Look at your hair, don't you think it is worth it",5
"I just received this yesterday. Because one of the reviewers stated that it took forever to get the item shipped and received, I especially wanted to write in and say that I ordered it on Wednesday, and I received it on Thursday! I do have a Prime membership, but even without a Prime membership, you should not have to wait long to receive this item.Soon after I received my package, I carefully cleansed my face and gave myself a treatment with the red light. I should mention that I am 68 years old, so I have lots of wrinkles and sagging to work on! Well, amazing! The next morning my skin was much tighter, wrinkles were diminished and sagging was lessened. I was really surprised, but if that is the improvement I get with just one treatment, I am thrilled!I will continue to post my experience with this light treatment as time goes on.",5
I got this set for my little niece and she loved it! Beautiful colors and it was a way to show her creativity off! She had so much fun playing with this hair extension set!,5
"This is a great lotion for everyday hydration. It is thick and moisturizes well. The fragrance is also subtle, which I appreciate. Wonderful value for the money.",5
This is a beautiful soft yet highly pigmented pink.  Maybe the softness comes from all of the moisture but I like it.  If you are looking for a pale pink this is NOTit!,5
"This shade of L'Oreal Excellence Creme Hair Color is very hard to find in stores around my house. It is either very popular, or very unpopular. This price is higher than in stores when I can find it, but the convenience of being able to get it when I need it out weighs the cost.",5
"I have fine, wavy-to-curly hair--and lots of it.  I use Deva-Curl products pretty consistently, and I have liked Aquage products as well.  I use Deva-Curl's non-lathering shampoo (&#34;No-Poo&#34;), their One leave-in conditioner, and some of their styling products.  In order to try this Toni&Guy; product, I used a traditional lathering shampoo and just a bit of conditioner, rinsed well.  I applied a quarter-sized amount of the Plumping Whip to towel-dried hair, just before drying with my diffuser.Plumping Whip left my hair shiny.  It didn't plump my fine hair.  It laid it down and didn't allow the curl to come out.  It softened my hair so much that my hair laid flat, not my usual profusion of wavy-curls in my short cut.  Root boost?  Not for me.The directions say to use a &#34;walnut-size&#34; amount.  Um, would that be a whole walnut in the shell?  A shelled, whole walnut?  A half a walnut?  This instruction makes for a lot of error, in my opinion.  Another reviewer said she used an almond-sized amount, so I see I'm not the only person to wonder at what a &#34;walnut-size&#34; amount means.Scent is nice.  Lotion-y, as others have described.  Is easy to put on hands, rub together palms and work through hair.  But it just doesn't do much for my hair.",2
"Great color, it really is periwinkle.  Depending on what you wear with it, it will appear either bluish or purple-ish.  Love it, it's real fun on both fingers and toes!!China Glaze is my favorite nail polish, and a favorite of most of my friends too.  I've heard some complain on here (Amazon) about how it's too thin, requires several coats, color is not true, yada yada yada.I dispute all of that.  China Glaze is NOT your average nail polish.  Apply ONE (1) VERY THICK COAT.  One thick coat that you would never do with another polish... real thick, so that you have full coverage and there's no nail showing through.  Let dry... it dries really fast compared to other polishes.  You're done!  No second coat ever needed, and I have about 20 different colors... it's been the same with every one!  I have never found a color that required more than one THICK coat.It glides on beautifully, dries quickly... but my favorite thing about it is the relatively low odor.  The ""nail polish smell"" dissipates pretty quickly.  An hour or two after I paint my nails, I can no longer smell it.Sure, a dark color like this is going to show chips... touch ups are easy and look great.  I often get a week or more from my manicure, just by touching up.  Light colors, I get even more time from.I can't say enough great things about China Glaze.  It's the best polish on the market, in my humble opinion!",5
"My skin hasn't glowed like this in years. A little back story - I have exzema on my face (mouth, nose, forehead & hairline) and have had it since the age of 14. I use a prescription topical cream everyday which makes my skin very oily and dull looking. Fast forward - Not only does this serum make my skin glow, it has also lessened the effects of the exzema! My recent visit to my dermatologist said it all for me. Once he looked at my face, he immediately asked what I had done to my skin. I told him that I have been using this serum and he was totally amazed at how I looked. He offered to write me a prescription version of this serum but I told him I'd rather keep using this, as it seems to do wonders for me. I no longer use my topical prescription cream everyday, as prescribed. I know use it maybe twice a week. Goodbye dull oily skin... Hello fabulous glowing woman!I am a fan for life!",5
"Miracle Blur is great and it smooth's out your skin, making it look flawless... I do use a light foundation over it.  But when the warmer weather comes, I will just use this product and a little blush.  Can't believe some of the negative reviews...well, every skin type is different, and what works for some doesn't work for others!  By the way, I use the &#34;oil free&#34;  and it went on better for me then the one with oil.",5
this is a great product I was very pleased with the product I really love all the different setting and the heating capabilities it great for our hair yes i am black and the texture of my hair is very course,5
I use this once a month as a deep conditioner and my hair is doing quite well!  Hair is much stronger!,5
I purchased these at Walmart after I was told by my esthetician that I should use salycic acid in my skin care routine. I tried these out and loved them. They are really great at getting rid of blemishes and also removing any dirt/makeup from your skin that your cleanser didn't fully get.,5
"I don't know how to describe Amor Amor except to say that I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this perfume. It is my FAVORITE and I've been wearing it faithfully almost everyday for the last 5 years or so.  It's a warm, sexy fragrance and a bit exotic / spicy but, it's definitely wearable during the day.  It's not overpowering.  It has citrus and woody notes; there is an interesting ""kick"" to it that, in my opinion, sets it apart from other warm fragrances.  If this helps at all, almost all my female friends, my guy friends and my brother LOVE this perfume on me, haha.  They are constantly telling me how great I smell whenever they hug me, and sometimes my friends sniff my hair and neck because Amor Amor smells so damn good, hahaha.  The only drawback to Amor Amor is that it has HORRIBLE staying power; it fades a couple hours into wearing it and I have to constantly reapply.  Other than that, I love this perfume and can't imagine not wearing it.  I've tried to look for other perfumes and have tested SO many but, I always come back to Amor Amor.",5
"I like this co-washer a lot---it cuts my hair shower time in half. The smell is not my favorite, but I am just not a coconut fan.",5
"I have been looking for a hand cream that was very rich moisturizing, yet didn't feel slippery and heavy. And that's exactly what this feels like. Just like the rest of their products - the smell is just heavenly. My hands feel soft and pampered, especially perfect for windy cooler days outdoors. Just ordered their body lotion, expecting nothing but perfection! Their products really spoiled me =)",5
"Nothing beats dermatologica products. They just make great stuff! We have used their stuff for a long time, and it really prevents breakouts and does what its supposed to.",5

"Tsubaki conditioner is unlike anything we can find in the U.S.  The Mrs. and I had the pleasure to live a number of years in Japan, where she found this conditioner, and used it religiously.  In Okinawa in particular, we found the water so heavily full of dissolved minerals that the tray under our dish drying tray would be coated in a sheet of calcium that could be peeled from the tray after only a couple of uses.  THIS conditioner fought that, and we find back in the States and Tsubaki Golden Repair Conditioner makes even my new bristly beard baby soft.There are a number of things that the Japanese do better than the rest of the world - this Hair Conditioner is one of them.",5
"This product is exquisite, made in Monza-Italy, sweet and delicious. It is not a fake product, but talking about its container it leaves a lot to be desired...  I used to buy it 10 years ago and as I still have the can of my last one so I compared it with the new one. The can is now made of a very weak material, in fact, even when the package came with the air filled plastic bag, all the cans (4) came with small dents on them, and 1 of those, which I will keep for myself, was not adjusted making the lid be always loose... when I grabbed it for the first time the bottle fell down, the good is that it's made of a very resistent glass and didn't break. At least, the other 3 will be a gift and I will keep the ugliest one, in all the Blue Jeans EDT is a GREAT, sweet, awesome product, but Amazon did not care about sending a product in a spoiled can... Not happy with that!",4
"I added these to my basket of nail paraphernalia. I think everyone that does their own nails should order these. They are awesome. It took me a few tries to get the hang of working these, but now I love them!",5
"I've been using bare minerals for a few years but was never really happy with it.  Decided to try this since it was so cheap, figured even if the make up sucks it was worth it for the cute bag but to my surprise I think the makeup covers better than bare minerals.  I also don't think the brushes are as bad as some of the other reviews have said.",5
"Previous to this, I had a Remington Wet to Straight Flat Iron and loved it. However, it got stolen on a plane trip from Baltimore to LA and I never replaced it until now. This product is a little smaller than my original one, so it fits in my purse if I want to take it to work. It is also great for a quick straightening after getting out of the shower when time is running out in the mornings. I have curly hair, so I do not straighten everyday but maybe once/twice a week to change up my look, so this product is perfect for that. It also came with coupons for Garnier hair care, made especially to keep hair healthy if you straighten more often than I do, and so far I have nothing but great things to say about the Remington S7211 1-inch flat iron. Highly recommended as a reasonably priced and good product for your straightening needs.",5
"Roc treatment products are great, and the Daily Moisturizer for deep wrinkles is wonderful.  I use it faithfully--and I have no deep wrinkles.  It works well with the Nightly Moisturizer for Deep Wrinkles, helping to keep those furrows at bay.  Love the stuff and highly recommend it!",5
"The yellow and the purple in the set I received were too thin to stand on their own with a normal amount of coats. The yellow was the color of chicken soup, not the flashy neon I was expecting. The other colors I have managed to work with but the polish is very prone to chipping and tip wear- I've had chips pop up the same day I put the polish on. Save yourself some time and effort and go for something else.",2
Maybelline is a good product. I should've ordered the next color darker and will next time. Seems to not stay on as long as it should but for the price I'm not complaining.,4
"I turned 50 this year and with my ultra sensitive skin have had problems with just about any new product I try to put on my face.  I bought this on the recommendation of a family member who had begun using this with the Nuface Trinity (and looked really great).  I decided to invest in myself and bought both products.  I am amazed at the difference in my skin in the two weeks I have been using this.  After the first week I also tried using some hyaluronic acid (the Watts Beauty one) and that has also been amazing.  I am seeing results from the Trinity as well and am taking weekly pictures of myself to catalog my progress (which I have read is most pronounced after 90 days).  The Clarisonic Mia change was almost immediate and has made my skin so soft and has evened out the tone as well (honestly I don't know if is partly the Trinity as well - but the combination seems to be working very well).  I also can use it with my own gentle cleanser (I did buy the delicate brush heads).  I am very, very happy with my Clarisonic Mia!",5
"This did not work well on my face or neck, only place that it work totally wonderful was my hands.  It was a bit harsh on my face but I liked the smell and the ease of using it.  I may try it again in the summer.",3
"This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp. Although it is described as an oil to be poured on the scalp, mine came solidified. This was not surprising due to the cold weather. However, it has not liquefied even at room temperature. Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply. It does melt in the hand. When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell. Once applied, the aroma dissipates. Apply one or two teaspoons and massage into the scalp. You then comb through the hair and leave on for a minimum of two to three hours before washing out. I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight. It washes out easily. I must say I was impressed with the results. My hair is fine and color treated. Over the years it seems to have lost  both its luster and volume. After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy. There is genuine shine and plenty of body. My hair seems to have grown faster but not thicker. I occasionally get a little snow on the mountain, so to speak and since using, have not noticed any grey. I think this is a good product that can help boost condition and shine. Recommended.",4
"I bought two of this for my girlfriend and my mother, they love it, smeells sooooo good. They are happy with this gift. Great product.",5
"I have had a lot of companies have sent me vitamin C serum to review and Even Glow Serum has been my favorite one to use.This Vitamin C Serum has some unique qualities to it that other vitamin C serums do not. I love that this vitamin C serum has an orange color to it, making it easy to see while applying in to my face. The vitamin C serum also has a pleasant citrus smell to it which is awesome as previous products I tried had no scent to it. I will use my beauty products more if it has a nice scent to it. Even Glow vitamin C serum is also thicker which makes it easier to apply as it does not run down your face.",5
"I'm a big fan of Fekkai products, especially the color saving products, but hadn't yet tried the hairspray. Since I have thin hair, it's hard to find a hair spray that actually holds my hair. It'll look great in the morning, but by lunchtime is flat. Nothing is worse than buying a new hairspray with all its promises of &#34;hold for hours without crispiness!&#34; and &#34;mega hold while keeping movement!&#34; and ending up with bupkis.After a couple of weeks of use, I did find I liked this hairspray. The scent isn't too terrible, the hold lasts into the afternoon, and there's no flakes if I touch or brush my hair. Like other sprays, this one promised &#34;soft, flexible hold that won't stiffen your natural hair&#34;, but this wasn't quite true. Yes, there's movement, but it's not exactly soft and flexible. You can tell you have hairspray in your hair if you run your fingers through it or brush it.Give it a whirl if you like Fekkai products as this IS a nice spray; it's just not the ultimate hairspray if you are looking for staying power from dawn until dusk.",4
"The brushes are nice and the set is cute, as many others have pointed out. However, these ""eco"" products arrive in very large, thick plastic cases, and stink of PVC - How ""eco"" is that??  I will return them - After all, we vote with our wallets, folks. (I ordered the 6-piece set containing 5 brushes and a travel case, as well as the kabuki set - Both come in large, plastic packaging and were originally shipped from China - so much petroleum and industrial waste goes into the manufacture and shipping of these products - I can't justify keeping them).",2
"I am using this product to create shapes (smaller nose, cheeks, hide double chin) and it works perfectly over a lighter powder",3
"This is a great product, you get all you need for a great price, I don't think you can get all these products for less than this price. I have tried them and they work excellent. And if you only do your own nails this kit will last you a long time. You can also mix them up with gel polishes from other brands and still work really good and last the same as if you were using only gelish products. The only thing missing here that would make this the greatest kit would be if it came with cleaning pads, but I guess you can't have it all, right?? Just make sure you follow the instructions to the t. :)",5
"I ordered this to start a new skin regimen for not my face.  Jesus help me!  The bristles on this thing are hard and are rough.  They will take everything off of you, so for that this gets a star.  The fact that after using it it caused my legs to break out in a horrible rash that took weeks to heal and that it stripped off more skin than I wanted it to, it loses the rest of its stars.  It might work well for feet but I would definitely not use it anywhere else.",1
"I am simply smitten with my recent (how did I just learn of this:!:!) discovery of Vinylux. I was once a fake nail girl. Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive. After a few years without, I swapped to shellac. I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds. THIS stuff is the bomb. I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well. My nails peel and chip within a day with regular polish. This stuff is the bomb. So happy. I haven't kept it on a week yet. It's so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover). Love it!Natural, quick, easy, beautiful. Super happy!",5
"The Hydroxatone Microdermabrasion came in a pretty blue, thick, plastic container. There is a mild scent, nothing too flowery or overwhelming. This is basically a scrub that removes dead skin. After one use my face was smooth and soft. It did not dry out my face or cause any inflammation. It doesn't take a a lot of scrub to polish your face, which is good since this isn't a huge jar  (1.7 ounces, unlike what the description says at 1.8 ounces). The jar does flare out at the top, but this is an illusion. The container that holds the cream is actually tube shaped on the inside with no actual product in the flared part. This scrub would work very well with an electric scrub brush. It is a bit pricey, otherwise I would give it a 5.",4
"I wouldn't recommend this in the winter if you get dry like I do, but I used this on a trip to the Caribbean last week and it was perfect. I am normally an oily mess in pictures where I use sunscreen so this was the perfect amount of coverage. Only a slight oily sheen afterwards, compared with my usual moisturizers.",4
This cologne is one of my favorites of all time and this is my second order of getting it which was great.,5
"Great treatment, I mixed mine with Kanechom Ultimate Karite Butter. Awesome combo. Great manageability and softness. Can't go wrong with these two.",5
"My skin tone is medium dark and I'm of Asian descent. I bought this palette because I wanted an alternative to the naked palette. I'm so glad I did because the colors are so rich and pigmented. They blend amazingly well and feel so soft and silky. I used this palette for my New Years look, my Christmas look and I even use it on everyday occasions like school and work. It's so versatile and easily a must have for me when I travel. Highly recommend.",4
This product helps diminish my acne scars.  It took about a month to really see results.  Id say another bottle of this stuff and ill be good.  One bottle lasts about 2 months if you just use it at night.,4
"I have been flat ironing my hair for almost 10 years now. I have tried MANY different flat irons, from CHI, Tigi, Sedu, Vidal Sassoon, GHD, Revlon, and the list goes on. I've used flat irons that have pulled my hair out, mysteriously stopped working within weeks of purchase, fried my hair, etc. Out of all the different flat irons I've used, the Remington S9500 is my absolute favorite. This product makes my hair look better than products that cost 5x as much!! My friend has absolutely gorgeous, shiny hair, and I asked her what products and tools she uses in her daily routine. She told me about the Remington S9500 and after reading amazing reviews on it, I had to go get it for myself. After using it the first time, I was in love.It heats up SUPER quick- like within 20 seconds quick (on the turbo setting), and beeps to let you know it's ready!! If you're like me and are forgetful when you're in a hurry, don't worry- this product has automatic shut-off after 1 hour. The movement is very smooth and it glides like butter. I have very thick hair and flat iron my hair in 3 different layers, but I only have to go over each piece of hair 1 time. I haven't had that luck with many other flat irons. This product literally cut my styling time in half!! The controls are digital, so it's easy to see exactly what temperature it's at. My favorite thing about this straightener is that it makes my hair shiny, silky, and leaves it without any frizz. I can't say enough about how amazing this product is. Try it for yourself-- you'll thank me later. ;)",5
"An important warning for this product is that it's flammable prior to drying.  That's because it uses propane, a liquid petroleum, as a base.  The FDA considers Propane safe for cosmetics.  The purpose of using it is to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFC repellents).  By using propane, Suave Keratin expands quickly and leaves no greasy residue.  This dry shampoo is non-greasy.",5
I have this matte lip cream in the color Stockholm. It is such a lovely peachy nude color. The best part is that it smells like cake! It also feels very velvety on my lips. I plan on buying more shades of this.,5
I use it for the back bottom of my hair and it works well.  It is simple to use and handy.,5
"They are not a great or best quality but you cant ask for more the price, I have been used them and even tho they are good and really helpful...",4
"This provides nice body to my long fine hair; I flip my head over, shake my stuff while misting evenly.  Keep your arm a good distance away from where you want it because it comes out forcefully.  I step into our walk-in shower to spray to avoid it laying a fine crust on my sink area.  I am impressed at the holding power, it is great at roots for lift and for updos that mean business.",4
"I love the product and the consistency.  Love that it's natural.  But what I was searching for was something that smelled like rich vanilla, no musk but just yummy warm vanilla.  This product smells clean and light and more like a sugar cookie (as one of the other reviewers said.)  Still yummy but I'll still be searching for another product (probably Pacifica Island Vanilla which I've had before.)",3
"When you open the container you get a strong smell of concentrated sage. It is not a pretty flowery scent, but rather earthy. I liked it. The clay itself is very thick. I have used other face masks before and this one definitely feels different. It is much thicker, it is not creamy. If you have tried pottery making it feels like clay when you add a bit of water to it. Not surprising, since this is mud.I am attaching a collage of 4 photos to illustrate this review. You can find them by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.&#10004; Photo #1 shows the tub the cover off&#10004; Photo #2 shows the mud in the tub&#10004; Photo #3 shows mud as I picked up some with my finger, this photo gives you a good idea of texture and thickness&#10004; Photo #4 shows the mud spread on my skin.When you put the mud on your face it quickly dries and you really feel the pull on your skin. The container came with no instruction, nor did I find instructions on Maple Holistics web site. I was not sure how long to leave the mud on my face for. I gave it 15 minutes. When I was ready to remove it I used a wet paper towel to clean it off my face. I figured mud may not be good for my septic system and doing it with the paper towel allowed me to toss the paper towel with mud into the waste basket. It took about 5 sheets of paper towels to remove the mud from my face. After the mud was removed my skin felt really nice, very clean. The whole process made me think of detailing my car. I have been using claying preparation to clean my car to remove the deposits from the paint for years and my car always looks great after I clay it. My skin felt exactly the same way, removing the mud from my skin removed debris, dead skin cells, small blemishes. It felt and looked terrific.My only wish is that this preparation had instructions! How long should I leave it on my face? How often should the mask session be repeated? Since the removal is a fairly time consuming process I plan to use the mask once a week on the weekend, leaving the mud on m face for 15 minutes.I received this mud preparation from the manufacture for sharing my experiences (good or bad) in a review. I have described the positives and the negatives of my experience. I hope Maple Holistics follows reviews and might be able to provide additional instructions as comments.Ali Julia review",5
"I've had a foam dispenser in the kitchen but purchased the sensor dispenser by simplehuman and LOVE LOVE LOVE our dispenser and this soap is perfect for it! it's specially formulated to work well and I love how it smells, feels and makes my hands feel.  If you have a sensor soap pump, you need to get any of the different formulas by simplehuman.",5
"Trying to get my teens to use this more and less of the chemical stuff to keep their skin healthy.  Steams pretty quickly and is very easy to set up.  You just need to make sure you have some place o store this thing, it takes up a good amount of space.  great steam though...heck of a lot better than using a kitchen pot and a towel.",5
"My gal's sister has darker complexion than the rest of the ladies in our family so she was glad to try this Jergens BB Body Perfecting Skin Cream.  She is an active parent who is into exercise and hanging out with other moms.  After trying this product for seven days, she did not notice any significant difference compared to the Vaseline Aloe Fresh Lotion that she uses daily.  Claimed results of Hydration: same as other daily lotions.  Illuminates, evens, firms, and corrects skin: not noticeable after seven days.  It's clearly not as effective as the La Mer skin care products that she pays high prices for.  Overall: a good moisturizing lotion for daily use after doing dishes, gardening, chores, etc...but definitely not effective for restoring youthful skin compared to premium skin care products.",3
"Yes! Just what I wanted and for the price!  Amazing I used right away and I love it, about the light in my opinion it's great in others idk but I think it was a good choice (:",5
"Im not sure if the one I got was old and a bit dried out, but it really doesnt come out smooth, or at all. i find with eyebrow markers, if I cut a bit of the point off, that seems to help things flow. I can clearly see the liquid rising up the marker, but it never adequately goes to the tip.It is a nice shade of very light blonde though, and I do mean REALLY pale. My favorite eyebrow marker in terms of application and lasting a long time, is just too dark, so I was hoping this would be my new one. But alas, I am still on the hunt for a light colored eyebrow marker that actually works.",3
"This foundation was SO easy to apply. I just dabbed it with the pads of my fingers and then blended it on my face. It was like magic - such even, flawless looking coverage! I was absolutely in love with this mousse foundation! That is, until I started getting extreme pimples (the large painful cysts) from it after about a week of all-day wear. I was so disappointed, because otherwise this was the perfect foundation. I have acne-prone and sensitive skin, though, so it may work for those girls who are blessed with non-temperamental skin. I'll stick with my Maybelline mineral powder foundation.",3
Consistency of the top coat is quite thick which leaves bubbles on top. You have to apply very thin layer and brush off excess or any visible bubbles before curing.Cured under LED lamps as well.,4
"very nice and classy. fits perfectly for my 10 y/o daughter. she loves to collect cute hairpins and clips, this one adds to her collection.",5
"Right from the start I knew this mascara was different.  It comes nicely packaged.  The mascara and the brush are separate, and the mascara is capped for freshness.  I liked that I could see the brush nice and clean before usiing it.  The color I used is Very Black.  I used 2 coats and could really see a difference from other mascaras.  It made my lashes look longer and fuller.  I'll definitely buy this product in the future.",5
"This is the real thing.  I have been using Curve for men for about 7 years.  It smells great.  The price was great.  I am a woman but I have to use men's cologne.  Women's cologne always causes me to feel light-headed.  I am pleased with this purchase and will purchase again, when needed.",5
"So beautiful on the hair, strong,but the metal kind of too sharp so need to be careful when to stick on the hair.",3
This conditioner smells just as good as the shampoo and it had a wonderful lingering effect.I didn't need much of it in the shower i left it on for 2 minutes and my hair was so smooth.Unfortunately i still needed to add a product for frizz but it did seem shinny. The best part is i could smell my hair all day! I just love that so i will for sure pick this up again.,5
i love curve i have the blue bottle and the purple bottle and now the new curve soull..smells really good!!,5
Love the Crave Naturals Whiplash Pink Eyelash Curler!  Eyelash Curlers usually pinch my eye lids but not this one!  It really gives a beautiful curl and doesn't leave kinks in your eyelashes.  I highly recommend it to any girl!,5
"This is a soft colour with sparkle.  As I have said on my other reviews, I go for the softer colours.  This one has a sparkle which I also like.  This brand is the only gel nail colour that I use.",5
"This shampoo has a nice fresh scent and makes my hair feel a little silkier than my regular shampoo (Kirkland Signature). But it does not produce enough suds. I have long hair and generally froth up the shampoo on my scalp then massage it through the rest of my hair. But if there are no suds, the rest of hair does not get clean. I have to get another palm full of shampoo just to do the rest of my hair.This shampoo seems fine, but it's not so great that I will be switching.",4
"very nice color 065 if you have medium skin tone, and lasts about 2-3 hours. texture is very light and i love the feeling on my lips when wearing this lipstick!",5
I typically have normal to oily skin so generally use lotions only in the winter. This Vaseline Sheer lotion goes on light and feel surprisingly silky (very nice!). It blends into the skin quickly and doesn't feel sticky. My only complaint is the fragrance. The perfumey smell is rather strong. I'm hoping they'll consider making an unscented version.,4
"I always keep a pump bottle of face wash with 2% salicylic acid at my sink for morning and evening uses. I've tried several brands, and I like this Biore version as well as any others. The salicylic acid helps control any tendency towards acne without being too harsh for me. Biore foams and rinses, leaving my combination skin nice and clean. I haven't noticed any drying or irritation. Although this has ""ice"" in the name, there's just a very mild cooling sensation from the menthol, perhaps even less than I notice fromBiore Acne Clearing Scrub (1% Sal Acid), 4.5 Ounce.One minor note of comparison: some pump bottles (likeClean & Clear Essentials Foaming Facial Cleanser, 8 fl oz) will lock in place if twisted, so that the bottle can be packed without making a mess. Biore's pump doesn't lock into place - a small detail that will only matter to you if you want to travel with this bottle.",4
This is a nice no wipe sealant for gels and acrylic but it gets heat spikes worse than any I have used before.,4
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is 14 and she asked for it by name. She really likes it, but when I borrowed it to try it out, I wasn't very impressed.It seems a bit bulky and my hair got caught repeatedly in the crack where the plates meet the plastic housing. I got so tired of my hair being ripped out. I don't know if it makes a difference or not, but my hair is down past the middle of my back, but my daughter's hair is just touching her shoulders.I didn't find that this straightener made the hair any smoother or sleek than other straighteners.While using this, you also have to keep watch as to how you're holding it as you go over each section. If you have it one way for one section and then hold it basically upside down for the next section, you will end up with different results on each section due to the rounded side. When I use my regular flat straightener, I can just place the hair and and go and it doesn't matter if I have it upside down or not. Sometimes you just grab the pieces of hair and get them however you can, but with this straightener you can't do that.",3
"I&#8217;ve been using this peel for 4 months now, and my skin looks much better and younger.  I&#8217;ve been getting compliments and asked what I&#8217;ve been using and I always recommend this peel.",5
"I am biracial, African American/Caucasian. I have dark spots on my face from sun damage and acne scarring. I have tried MANY very expensive products and some prescriptions as well.  This has worked better than anything I have ever tried - I have been using this serum for only a week and have had significant improvement!  I am hopeful that with further use my skin will improve even more.",5
"L'oreal makes many hair color brands, The Superior preference brand is just TERRIBLE to apply.  It is extra runny and watery.  I could not stop the dripping and I have been coloring my hair for 20 years.  I'm very careful and do it in sections but this is not a cream type like the excellence is.  It was literally dripping off my gloves after I put it in my hair.  I never had a problem with any other hair color product and not even by L'oreal.  This formula is way too watery!!!  I never had so much drip to the floor ever before.Always buy the cream kind, or the mouse.  This stuff is terrible!!  :(I swear the good reviews must be for the L'Oreal Paris Excellence Preference and not this.  The boxes look almost the same.Boo on how runny it is!!!!",1
It only has one problem it's a bit harsh,5
"This doesn't seem much different than the cheap kind you can buy at walmart. It is a little bit softer than those, but doesn't seem that mush better. I prefer the kind from bath and body works.",3
"I like this product a lot.  After I towel dry in the shower, I spray my back easily and rest of my body quickly rub it into my skin.",4
It fades the spots in three days and smells great. i use this four days tops and the marks go away!! Works,4
"This a wondrously heavenly sexy , light , aromatic scent.  I am rather smitten by Miss. Lopez. I simply adore her and I am very pleased with this perfume.",4
I bought this product along with many other products to make my own hair grease. And it keeps my hair moisturized enough that I can use it monthly.,5
"I've used eyelash curlers from the time I was in my teens (a long, long time) and had used another brand for the past 25 or so years. This eyelash curler from Tweezerman has made me a convert and I'm hopeful that this business is in business for a long, long time!  Great product, Tweezerman!",4
"When this became available on Vine, I was quick to pick it up for my wife. She has naturally curly hair, and while I love it (I almost cringe whenever she starts straightening it), she often goes through a lot to get it looking like she wants. After using it a few times she was very much a fan of the S9520 and declared it the ""best straightening iron"" she's ever owned. That sounds like high praise to me.She likes how the S9520's wide plates just seem to glides through her hair without snagging in places the way some of her other irons have. Between how quickly it heats up and how much less time she spends, it's definitely a time saver too. She's able to get superior results in half the time with this. It's definitely built solidly too. She commented on that, so I picked it up (that's about all I can do with it after all) and it was surprisingly solid and well-made.All-in-all, I'm very happy that I was able to pick up the Remington S9520 Ceramic Hair Straightener for my wife. It gets a lot of use and is working just as well as when she first used it 4 months ago.",5
"The emery boards I've been using and which I purchased from Sally's for nearly 2.00 each are longer and the board is a bit finer. However, they print all along the middle of one side of the board which makes it practically useless so I've paid a lot for one side of the board. And, they do not last very long. These are a bit shorter and seem to have a finer side and a bit less fine side both of which I think I'll be able to use for my natural fragile nails. This is a very good buy and I'm extremely pleased.  I have enough to share a couple with other nurses on the unit as none of them ever seem to have an emery board.  I'm very happy with this purchase. I now have enough boards that when one gets too slick I can just throw it away without thinking ""I just threw out almost 2.00"". It's nice that they are all individually wrapped so that they don't get worn rubbing up against each other in the container.  Thanks Amazon.",5
I do not like that you have to use 2 or 3 coats to get it to really show up.,2
"Like everyone else says, they work. Now the effectiveness can be up for debate, but I have fairly sensitive skin so I don't really want to melt my nose off. I am happy that it doesn't pull the skin off my nose, yet still seems to get some of the blackheads every time.",5
"The Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter is one of THE BEST hair products I've gotten to try in the past five years! My hair is extremely long and thick and I have a problem getting a nice curl to stay in my hair all day long! And this is with the weather cooperating completely, I'm not even talking about if there is even a little bit of humidity! So, needless to say, I have hard to curl hair.I love EVERYTHING about this set! The rollers are ready to go in TWO minutes.  The dual heating seals the hair and there is not a single hair out of place.  You get smooth, beautiful, big and bouncy curls in FIVE minutes! FIVE, I'm NOT kidding! So, even when I'm in a rush and I want to have a really nice style, it doesn't take long at all!Since using the set, I've gotten a ton of compliments and I really couldn't be happier!  Even if you're on the fence about buying these, I'd say go for it! I highly recommend these rollers to any and ALL hair types.For me, I like the fact that there are TWO different size rollers.  The Large and the Extra Large rollers are most beneficial to me because of the length of my hair.  I have a hard time finding rollers in a size that actually hold enough of my hair and I do use ALL the rollers that are provided for each use.  Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, this will obviously vary.The only minor problem I found with the rollers (and this is VERY minor) is that the base/case that the rollers are on IS kind of large.  Therefore, it does need to be stored in the closet in my bathroom.  They do take up quite a bit of room to just be left out on the vanity.I love the clip, being a dual heating technique, it really heats the hair quickly and when you unroll...absolutely gorgeous! I can't say enough about this product! Remington is a well-known name that I've come to trust over the years.  Not only for quality, but for value as well!",5
I luv this stuff. It has a very light smell and its great for the health of hair. It's not to thick and it blends well with castor oil. People should try.,5
"My daughter ordered based on the picture - the colors of pink , blue and gold shown, it is not what comes. At the end, it came purple / dark pink w/ some subtle glitters - totally different from what is shown, so she became disappointed. I am adding more details on the above message. I would like to state that the product gets the color shown in the picture when it gets light on it, I mean artificial light.",4
"I have thick, very curly hair that I style naturally...just finger-combing and I'm completely good with that.  This style works for all seasons..especially during the summer when I am in and out of the ocean and/or pool A LOT. I do not flatiron, straighten, or blow dry my hair .  I followed the directions on the can, and it all worked until I got to #3...which is &#34;Brush through your hair.&#34; I don't ever brush my hair because that removes all the individual curls but leaves a lot of volume; I DID brush it this time to use this product and it left me looking like a VERY unkempt lioness who had been scared by something really frightening.  This product may be good for people with straight hair or people with curly hair who try to have straight hair...although I also did not like the &#34;feel&#34; of my hair after using it.  I can not recommend it for those who wish to use it and STILL maintain their natural curls.",1
"Suave Natural Infusion Seaweed and Lotus Blossom works well as an inexpensive conditioner. It works a little better than you would think for the price. This product makes hair easy to comb through and style after using and it smells very nice. I try to stay away from sulfates and other ingredients that are found in this type of product, but overall, the performance was pretty decent for this Suave conditioner. My teenaged daughter really likes it too so that can save money on conditioner! This works well for the cost and the light scent is very nice.",4
"A more 'matte' bronzer, that you can use for contouring too. I like to use this on the crease of my eye when I want a more 'natural' look. Using a smaller face brush, just dust the tip over this bronzer and apply to cheekbone area into hairline. Use with blush or highlighter, and blend. When making-up a strong eye (ie. smokey eye makeup), this could be used on the cheekbones alone without blusher.Bottom line: this could be part of a basic makeup kit, and it compliments many skin tones.",5
"This was the first set of plates I ever bought.  I saw the commercial several times and thought it looked cool, so when I saw it in stores I had to try it.  There was a bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy.  These are nice plates, smooth steel front and nice backing. All the images stamp crisp and clear. The full nail images are kind of small compared to other brands and theres not a whole lot of images I liked but It comes with a plate holder that fits most other plates, a metal scraper and a double ended stamper so even without the plates its a good deal for the money.  This kit is definetly great for beginers to practice with.  I had never heard of nail art stamping before this product was advertised but aparently the concept has been out for several years. Amazon has lots of different sets to choose from too.  Happy Stamping!!!",4
"I gave this brush a try based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but positive. Everything about this brush was a disappointment. The way it looks, feels, and operates.  The price is what it is because it is junk.The handle ad ferrule are cheaply made. The brush hairs are rough and don't pick up color, cream or powder. The application of cream and powder is just terrible. The brush sheds BAD.  I washed the brush twice ti see if performance improved. No improvement, but more hairs lost.Instead if tossing, I now use it as a duster to clean tight spaces.",1
"This is a great product. I cannot tell a lie, my feet literally crack when I don't use a rich butter on them on a regular basis. I live in a very dry climate and I have to have a humidifier on all the time. This means my hands and feet really suffer and now with the cold weather coming on, it will only get worse.I wanted to find a product that was natural and not filled with chemicals since it was my intention to slather it on my feet and let it soak in over night every night.This was the perfect choice. It is very moisturizing and doesn't have a sweet sugary smell like so many butters do. I am really happy with this product and plan to keep using it all winter long. 5 Stars for sure!",5
"Exactly as pictured. As with any plates, it does take a little patience, but they work well.  Would definately again!",4
I bought this mouse because of the price.  It work ok on volumizing my hair but i do not like the film it leaves on my comb.  Not a bad product for the price.,3
"I'm a cycling freak, and therefore very diligent about sunblock use.  It's important that the sunblock I use actually work all day, from getting suited up as early as 4am to going home some time in the afternoon.This water resistant lotion held up rather well for a full day as a Marshal for the Five Borough Bike Tour in New York City, which had me out there from six in the morning until five in the afternoon.My only criticism is that in comparison to my old favorite, Brave Soldier brand sunscreen, it didn't hold up as well and did allow me to become slightly red.  I will add though, I've used other Banana Boat lotions before, in far harsher conditions, and they worked just fine.  My only problem with those was that they have a tendency to degrade over a few months, after which they can cause skin irritation.For most people, this is a good all-day sunblock, though I'll take one star away for not being as durable as Brave Soldier.It's a good walking around lotion, but if you're doing sports you may want to go with something that's going to provide all day protection without having take take a bottle of lotion with you.",4
"I'm a certified esthetician and used dermalogica line in school. This mask was my fav! And while it is very beneficial for aging/dry skin types, it also works for any skin types (just spot treat, applying on drier areas of your face) You need just a quarter size to cover your entire face, and way less if spot treating. Smells wonderful and works GREAT!",5
"Facial primer, like all e.l.f products is wonderful, however: the application top is defective and I was only able to use it twice.  Product otherwise is absolutely wonderful.  In fact, I ended up re-ordering Face Primer I loved it so much.",3
"First of all, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE JS hair extensions...I have more of these than I care to admit, and have consistently enjoyed her products.  However, this pony extension just didn't work for me.  I was hoping to use it in a high pony, but it just doesn't fall right.  When worn high, you can see the webbing on the back of the piece that holds it together. IF you wanted to wear it low, it would probably look much better - but would need to be cut because it is VERY long.  I'm hoping to brainstorm some way to wear this piece though, since it's great quality hair, and looks beautiful.",2
First I want to say that I love this product and I have used it for years. I received product quickly and was sadly shocked when I opened the package. Most of the product was in the bubble wrap package and not in the bottle!! I don't know if the bottle top was faulty or if it is hairline crack in bottle lid. I know accidents happen and this was a rather costly one. I don't blame seller but it was a rather costly mistake I hope doesn't happen again.,5
"I have pretty thin but long hair and these rollers work perfectly and they do not fall out, being that I have thin long hair I haven't truly gotten to use this product because I thought one package would be enough but I would prefer more than just 9 rollers which is in each package so I am ordering another package.  I recommend this product because it is easy to roll your hair up while damp and let air dry or even blow dry for faster results.  I do recommend putting some sort of shine product in your hair before rolling I like Garnier Fructice brilliant shine spray.",4
I'm truly disappointed in this product. The only thing it did for me was to make my skin feel dry. I wouldn't recommend.,2
"Got for daughter, she puts on too thick and it peels right off, drats.  Not a great color for more mature gel polish users.",4
"I am one of those people who does not like to believe that specialty hair care products (such as those used at salons) are worth the money. I tended to pick up my hair care products at Costco, whatever was cheapest in big bottles. This was fine until I got older (I'm in my late 40's) and my hair got dryer, coarser, and started to lose a lot of its shine. Now, it requires a lot more work and care to get it to look somewhat akin to what it once was.I've been sampling the entire line of ""Motions at Home"" products, and I have to say that I've been impressed. When I compare it to commercial shampoo and conditioner, it produces a better result for a smaller amount of product. The latter consideration is a bit of an adjustment since I'm used to having to fill my palm with conditioner, and you need a very small amount about this (a dab about the size of a quarter in my particular case). I've been using this moisturizer on the ends of my very long, thick hair at night after a shower. I rub it in to the last 6 inches starting at the tips and comb it through the bottom only. In the morning, my hair is noticeably shinier and easier to manage.The only thing I don't like about this is that the smell is quite strong and not particularly pleasant (unlike the other ""Motions at Home"" products, which tend to smell like coconut or citrus). Though it does disperse through time, it has a bit of the nasty chemical smell that one associates with salon perming or conditioning. I also wonder if those who have hair which is less voluminous and long may find that it is too heavy for their hair. I often joke that I have enough hair for 3 people, and it's not much of an exaggeration. I'd suggest anyone with less hair use it very sparingly and err on the side of too little rather than too much. I could easily see this weighing down someone's hair if they overdid it for their hair type.",4
"I have sensitive skin and this soap works great for me. It has a wierd smell to me but it's not a bad smell. I don't itch or get a rash, yay. We also use it on our two year old. You get alot of soap for the price and it lasts a while as well.",5
"I have long hair, and was looking for salon-style clips to section it when I need to dye it. I didn't want to buy in bulk.  These clips are very large, about 6 inches long, and work well.  I paid only $6.97, and found that to be a reasonable price for three clips.Simple and effective.",5
"I was so excited to be able to try this product.  In the past I have used and loved the Simply Ageless Foundation with SPF, and I currently use Olay's Regenerist SerumOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozever since the scentless version came out on the market around 6 years ago. I have sensitive skin that is normal-to-dry in the winter and normal during the other seasons.This new Cover Girl/Olay serum/primer has a lot of the same ingredients as the Regenerist Serum, but in a slightly different ""recipe"".  The silicones help with the dryness and also with blurring fine lines.  As with the Regenerist serum, you have to watch out for milia (these are hard white bumps that form underneath the skin).  Any ingredient with ""-cone"" on the end can cause milia to start up if you are prone to having this problem.Pros: Somewhat hydrating; blurring of wrinkles due to the silicones; good ingredients; foundation stays on longer than without using a primer.  One step is eliminated with the serum and primer mixed together in one skincare item.Cons: The various silicones can cause milia for some people; it's a one-ounce bottle, which may not last long if you use it daily.I'm not quite sure how I will use this product when I need a heavy moisturizer in the winter-time for this reason alone:  Serums are supposed to be applied before creams - always remember that the thinner-consistency skincare items go on first.  So it's serums, then moisturizer/creams, then primer and then foundation/make-up.  If I use this first, then put my moisturizer over the serum/primer, my foundation will not last all day like it should when using a primer.Even with my upcoming dilemma with winter dryness issues, this is a fine product and I recommend it. I may try using my Regenerist Serum first, then put this on top, as it's fine to mix serums together.  But I probably will put this away in November and save the rest of the bottle for warmer weather.",4
"I am on my second round of Accutane, so my skin is very dry and sensitive to the products I use on it. I switch off between this and myPhysiodermie - Shower Hydrating Milk SL - 200ml. I will use this if I have more dead skin on my face and I need more exfoliation. It has a super fine grittiness, but isn't like a scrub. Not nearly enough grit to be a scrub. It removes a full face of makeup with little effort, too. It is very gentle and I adore it. The smell, however, is gross. I have never liked it. Smells like oatmeal and clay. Ick.",5
"Overall this powder is pretty useless for me. It was hard to select my shade, somehow I got a fairly accurate color. Mineral Sheers coverage is pretty sheer, it does nothing to hide my pores, and if I apply enough to reduce redness it looks caked on, especially when I use the sponge. I guess someone with regular skin could use it, but there wouldn't be much of point. I really tried to let this product grown on me, but it honestly hasn't. The only pro is that it even when it is obviously caked on, I can barely feel it on my skin, the product has a silky texture. I also do believe it has kept my face matte. None the less the coverage is poor and overall quality is alright. Don't bother considering to buy this unless you're skin is pretty clear but a little shiny.",3
I Love this Lamp !!! I am trying to learn how to do my own nails and this is so easy to use. It's works great and it saves me money because I'm able to do it at the house I don't have to pay 30 or 40 dollars I just do it myself now. :),4
"Once Again, the Dermalogica skin care line does not disappoint! This is the best cleanser I have used for my acne prone skin, it is better than the La Mer Cleansing Gel I was using earlier and Dermalogica is at half the price. Highly recommend,",5
"I love this peel, it is sincerely amazing. I want to 'second' the other reviewer who says this is a SERIOUS peel even though you may be thrown off by the fact that it is derived from fruits. (well, weren't we all ;0).I recently did a ""buffered 70% glycolic"" at a spa and I find this to be far more effective for far less money. I used the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Peel for UNDER two minutes and WOWZERS, this bad boy works! I am a veteran of skin peels, microdermabrasion, and multitudes of other treatments and this is one of the best. I STRONGLY encourage you to try this peel and to NOT leave it on longer then TWO minutes the first time. I'm tough when it comes to peels and this would have done some damage if I would have left it on for over 5 minutes - just try it in increments. I'm so thankful I limited myself to this because when I 'washed' the peel off my face SKIN (old dead skin mind you!) was coming off too and not in miniscule amounts- this is no joke.I was feeling like just about every pore on my face was congested and only one use of this product has made my pores look smaller. I'm hopeful that with weekly use my skin will start getting that beautiful porcelain glow I see on some women.I'm finding it VERY difficult to believe anyone who says they had no results - I just cannot imagine it.",5
This is a very pretty vibrant pink color with lots of sparkles in it (but you don't get a super sparkly face in the finished application). It came as pictured and without damage. I love that the mirror is big for the compact size.,5
"I'm a product junkie.  I have bought every expensive cream, lotion, anti-aging product out there and spent tons of money doing so.  This cream is amazing.  Seriously!About my skin in case this helps:  I have very dry skin that is prone to break out.  I felt I had wrinkled prematurely because of sun damage so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products.  Often my forehead would be flakey and my chin would have breakouts.  Frequently I had red patches on my skin and a very uneven skin tone in general.Since using Cetaphil:  I have NONE of the flakiness and have not had one single break out.  Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated.  Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body.  Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I don't have that crepeiness (Not sure this is a word!).  I've thrown everything away and have started stockpiling this stuff.I have NEVER had a product that made such a difference.  My make up now looks better, I actually glow and I don't feel like I look my age anymore.  I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever, I have an even skin tone.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.",5
I am in love with Essie polish these days. I love this gray.  It has a slight purple tint on my skin tone but it's definitely gray.  It wears very well with a good top coat too.,5
"I don't always believe you have to pay a lot for quality, but when it comes to beauty products I may have just been taught a  lesson. The brushes look nice, but when you first use them they are rough and prick at your face. Every time I use this brushes, bristles are left on my face. And I am not exaggerating.... EVERY TIME. They get the job done, but if you are looking for quality, these are not brushes for you.",2
Thanks for the quick delivery.  I love this color but unfortunately I didn't realize you need a certain kind of lamp to dry it.  I kept it because I love the color and will work out how to use it ...thanks so much,5
"Great for daytime wear. If you want more of a dramatic look you may want to double the lashes. They ate very light, feels like you aren't even wearing lashes.",3
This is a wonderful product for natural hair. This product keeps my hair soft all week long. You can also use this product to do a great twist out. I have used many popular products and none kept my hair soft and moisturized pass a couple of days. If your hair loves a lot of moisture than this product is for you.,5
"Love this lotion, scent is nice, Snooki's lotion has a better scent, but that is just my opinion. I enjoy both and swap up every other time. Worth the purchase.",5
Did not do what I it said it would nor as I expected.  Did not last!  Didn't even last 2 weeks let alone a month.  Messy.  Simply a waste of money in my opinion.I do not recommend this product.,1
"I've been using this shampoo for years. I have thick, coarse, color treated hair.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny and healthy. I use it with the Nou Nou conditioner and love them both.",5
"I love Alterna Bamboo Smooth Anti-Breakage Thermal Spray.  It is awesome.  It is so good to your hair.  My hair used to break very easily.  I use a flat iron on it and also occasional hot rollers.  Also, I have highlights.  My hair is naturally curly and can get very frizzy.  I use this spray before blow drying my hair and again while flat ironing it or curling it.  It doesn't take a lot.  It has no smell whatsoever so that's good.  After using this product, the condition of my hair is so good.  I have also switched to DermOrganics shampoo and conditioning masque.  This has all made a HUGE difference to my hair.  I went from course, frizz, pouf  hair, to smooth, silky hair.  It's like it's not mine.  But it IS!  I love this and plan on buying it again and again.",5
"I love this stuff, the only thing is that it has a really perfumey smell.  It's not gonna keep your eyeshadow completely the same all day, it fades the color just a little throughout the day but it does the job it works good.",4
"I like this serum. I find it to be more like as moisturizer rather than a serum though, seeing as how it's thick and creamy and not like a liquid. It has made my sunburnt skin not peel at all, and I love using it at night before bed. I have been using it about a week now and already feel like my skin is tighter. Adovia makes some of the best all natural products out there. The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because my first bottle I received the pump didn't work, and I received a replacement for it, and unfortunately it was also messed up. I opened the bottle and the tube that pulls the serum up was too big and bent and it won't work at all. But as for a facial serum, this product is great! I just with my pump would work right!",4
"I got this product because I have been suffering from hair loss for a while now, and so far, I haven't had any problems with it.  The only real complaint I have is that the smell of the alcohol tends to be very strong when I put it on, but other than that I have no problem with it.  While I have yet to see any appreciable results, I feel fairly confident in saying that this product is a good one for women like myself who suffer from hair loss.",4
"I got three bottles of this when it was priced as a promotional item ....it was .96 for three bottles!!!!  I believe Amazon and the supplier were inundated with orders because it took about a month to get it filled, but it actually came with no extra charge.  What can I say?  It's soap liquid....it smelled nice, it lathered nice and it seems to be a ""natural"" product (EO brand) which has to be better than those other products loaded down with chemicals.  And for about .35 a bottle, I could use it to clean out my toilet and still be making money (I actually use it in some refillable hand soaps throughout the house since I'm more of a shower person myself).",4
"I've been using Colora Henna for a couple of years and really like it! It covers even partial grey hair, in spite of a lot of info. to the contrary that's online.I mix mine with room-temperature filtered water (not coffee or juices etc, again things mentioned online) and leave covered, overnight before I use.I leave it on for 2 hours before shampooing and conditioning.I don't apply any styling products for at least a day, to avoid any gels, mousse interacting with the henna.It is messy but so are other hair colors. It also takes a thorough shampooing afterwards to get out all the product.I usually like my hair after a couple of shampoos, to really see how the color will be.I switched to chestnut recently and have been getting a lot of compliments about the new color. I was using brown or ash brown before. The Chestnut is a rich, reddish brown, very nice. Vibrant!Don't be put off by the naysayers of henna. Try it for yourself.The bit of extra time and effort is so worth it. For your hair and your long term health. Regular hair color has a lot of questionable ingredients.Another plus of henna, no more worrying about some getting close or in your eyes. I always hated that the most about regular hair color.One more plus, it's cheaper than regular hair color too.Only one thing I wish they'd add to the package is a pair of plastic gloves, a cap would be nice too but I usually design one from a large plastic bag and that works ok.Recommended!Geraldine at myreallifereviews . com (you can see my full review of this product there along with photos)",4
"This is a great color, I had been looking for an eyeshadow color like this for a while, its kind of an iridescent purplish-blue. The color doesn't disappoint in person, but the shadow itself it a little bit chalky and you have to build up the color to get it to look dark. I do recommend doing your eyes first and then putting on foundation, or covering your cheeks while you put this on because it does have fall out. Its not the greatest shadow formula, but I love the color so I think its worth it (plus it's cheap!)",3
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! With thick hair that reacts to humidity in the SOuth in 2 seconds flat, I need a conditioner that will help weigh it down, without being heavy. This one does just that, and leave my hair soft and manageable.I like to use a small amount AFTER I wash my hair as a leave in conditioner- it gives me curls that I havent had since I was a small child, as it seals the hair and allows it to go back to it's curly origin! I use it the same way on my daughters long hair and her tangles have reduced by 65% easy! That alone is worth it!I have also found that I can add a little water to a small amount and put on dry hair and I can get some control back, after my hair has frizzes out. WHEW.Hydralight is a lifesaver!",5
"I don't notice any difference until I use quite a bit at which point my hair looks limp and greasy. My hair is fairly straight with some really slight wave to it. It looks normal but is actually pretty thick and settles nicely without much work but gets a bit frizzy especially on top, I hoped this would keep the frizz down but it did not. I continued my search for a styling product and I found bumble styling cream works well for me.",2
"you will feel re-fresh , it has a nice smell it makes you want to nap.",5
i never use it since i bought it....this is not exactly what i'm looking for. but it look nice not just what i was looking for acrylic nail brush.,3
I use this cream strictly on my face.. it is really good..and around the eye area it works beautifully!  It does what it says moisturizers!,5
"I like the packaging and the &#34;all natural&#34; approach to cuticle cream but this stuff did not fly with me.It is very greasy and does not absorb into the skin around the nails. Even though I used very little and wiped my fingers with tissue paper... I left little finger grease marks all over everything I touched.The smell is terrible. At first I thought it smelled like Lemon Pledge, which wasn't great, but tolerable. However, after it started drying, it left more of a lemon with a touch of skunk smell on my fingers. Not good.",1
"It instantly lifts my skin. The only downside is that it leaves kind a kind-of sticky film on my face, which seems like it takes forever to dry!",4
"i wanted something that would brighten my face. i love this! its looks baked and not glittery. has alittle shimmer to it and i love this. its a MUST have. i cant find this in stores anymore, so i order it here. its lightweight and looks natural. i like to build it if im going for a more dramatic look for evening.",5
"This is the absolute best hand lotion! I bought this for my mom and every time I visit her I use it. I need to get myself one now. It seems a bit thick but once it is on your hands/body for just a little while, my skin was so incredible soft and smelled very pretty.",5
"The lotion just like sat on top of my skin, didn't really get absorbed.Not a fan of the smell either. Thought it would be a heavy lavendaer smell, but that wasn't the case.",2
"I'm an AfricanAmercan female who is just trying to rid blemishes, but literally within one week and a half (two weeks at best) of using this morn and night I've turned 3 shades lighter lol so i panicked cuz I didnt expect it to actually work so fast and its not gradual. So my blemishes are def lightened but since my entire face is so much lighter i'll only used on specific spots from now on. If you are like me and are just using for acne blemish, its tedious but JUST PUT ON SPOTS THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS FAST.",5
I have used Dove Soap all of my life because I have always had sensitive skin. As I've grown older I've become allergic to many different items.  Dove has not let me down.  I love the moisture feeling unlike other soaps that leave you &#34;squeaky&#34; clean. It smells really good and has not irritated my skin.  I always recommend Dove!,5
I have used this product for a while and I can't say enough good things about it!  My lashes have grown since I started using it at night before going to bed and this makes run of the mill drugstore mascara look like a million bucks!,5
"I don't know why they call this oil control moisturizer, because it doesn't leave a matte finish on the skin nor does it remotely control oil throughout the day. I don't expect miracles, but when I apply my moisturizer and makeup at 7 am, I don't want to be shiny faced by 9 am! Quite honestly, I am less shiny when I don't use this. And for over $15, that's not acceptable.",2
"This makeup mirror is just like the one your mom had in the 60s, but now it's even cheaper and flimsier!  Hooray!I find the mirror's stand in the back to be so flimsy, I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't last even 6 months before breaking.  The magnification side of the mirror itself just looks a little 'off' someone, too (hard to describe -- sort of a 'fun house' effect?)  There is also a big ugly PERMANENTLY PRINTED ""Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors"" just above the mirror (yes, printed on the white plastic itself -- and no, it's not a removable sticker!)  This part is especially amusing, since there ARE no side mirrors!Steer clear of this one.",1
"DOVE MEN+CARE FRESH AND CLEAN 2 IN 1Although a clear cream, this was the thinnest of the 3. It had a medium strength masculine smell which I doubt lasts much past the shower time. I prefer separate shampoos and conditioners so that I can let the conditioner absorb for about 5 minutes. It doesn't make sense to soak your hair in a detergent and try to counteract the effects by adding a conditioner.DOVE MEN+CARE ANTI DANDRUFFThis was a thick white cream that had the strongest masculine smell of the group. Typical of dandruff shampoos is to include zinc which absorbs into the scalp and is effective. Coal tar is the most effective but you can't mask the smell- you smell like a miner for a couple of hours.DOVE MEN+CARE THICKENINGThis was a medium thick, gray cream. I have thinning hair and I found the ""thickening"" to be more mental than physical. The fragrance is weak enough that a woman would not be embarrassed using it.All of them lathered about the same. I prefer the Anti Dandruff overall. I will probably rotate them to get the benefit of the variances.",4
I absolutely love the dermastamp.  It is so helpful for getting those hard-to-reach areas when I'm  derma-rolling.ma' face.  Yeah buddy!!!,5
Use this and get rid of your little hangnails and also moisturize your nails. This keeps them from breaking. The smell is divine.,5
These plates are really amazing.. I have all 10 and each plate stamps amazing. No issues at all. And I use regular nail polish for stamping too. Great image selection on this plate. I highly recommend these plates.,5
"I tried the Nourishing ConditionerCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce, and while it was ""just OK"", I love this Root Boost version and will continue to use it. My hair is color-treated and dry, and my hair is thin but I have lots of it. I'm always pressed for time in the morning so I shampoo, then put a tiny, less than pea-sized amount of this root boost conditioner in my hand, apply it to my hair, and I LEAVE IT IN, no rinsing it out! It doesn't make my hair greasy or flat, in fact, I've never seen it so full.",5
"What is thisAxe Spiking Glue is supposed to be a hair gel with super strong hold to hold hair firmly in an upward, (spiked), position.Why do I need this?Cause you saw Jersey Shore or a lower-card UFC fight, and you said to yourself...I want this look?What's in the box, er...tube?The tube is about 3.2 ounces, but we found it to last about a month or five weeks of daily use of a dime sized dab.How well does it hold?I will admit, it holds. I used it on my youngest son, Garin, who has the hair this product is meant for. We found the best results were when his hair wasn't out of the shower, not fully towel dried, but somewhere in the middle. We applied the gel, went through 12 years of David Beckham hair styles until we found the one he liked...2006 for the curious. Then we told him to leave it alone, which lasts about 3 minutes for a nine year old boy.3 hours later?I rate it for three hours cause in my life that is the usual effective life of hair products. If you can find product that last three hours or more, you've found gold, buy it by the case, and cherish it like Gollum cherishes the ring. Now mind you, when I rated this product, it was put on a nine year boy, in Portland, in rainy season, which is any day in Portland. For the first hour, we were fine. However, by the second hour, it lost a lot of its hold and started to look like a matted mess. The David Beckham look became a George Clooney look around hour two. Which isn't bad I guess...I really need to stop reading TMZ before I write reviews.What does it feel like 3 hours later?The problem I see most often with guys when they use product is they either use too much or too little. Too little product yields unflattering results. Too much product often yields in cat tongue, where putting your hand or a woman's hand through your hair is like stroking a cat tongue. It also leads to flakiness depending on the composition of the product. I always use the rule of coins...start off with a dime, then move up to a nickel, then a quarter, and if you have hair that is unmanageable like Honey Boo Boo, move it up to a half-dollar. We used a dime for Garin's hair and it was enough to get the effect we wanted for the area we used. 3 hours later, it wasn't rigid. A lot of it has to do with the lack of alcohol you would find in old school hairsprays...remember Aqua Net? Note: Cetearyl Alcohol is not really an alcohol but a fatty wax like component. So you don't have to worry about that element drying out your hair. So yes, the claim Axe makes that this product doesn't dry out and feel rigid is true, but it does have some hold that you can feel.How does it smell?I never understood this aspect of hair products, with the exception of Paul Mitchell AhAhPoohie, 70% of hair products fall into a specific ubiquitous scent range. They either smell fruity, musky, or chemically formulated to fight dandruff. The Axe Spiked Glue is 80 percent musky and 20 percent fruity. If you can get an idea of what that's like, good luck. My suggestion, go to Target or your local drugstore, find this product, and smell it for yourself.Is there anything better?Yeah, I'm not touching this question, and anyone trying to answer it is full of crap. The problem with this is that everyone has different hair. There is not one product that will work for all hairs. Even Head & Shoulders has different models. I can't say this will be the best product for you, and then find out you're a black man with an Angela Davis fro. Now I kind of what to see what a black guy with spiked up hair looks like. I know what I'm Googling after I write this review. The truth is this, finding the right product for your hair is like finding the right woman. You have to go on a few dates with different ones to find the right one. Hell, sometimes, you think you found the right one, but you still want to see if there is something better...by the way, if you're laughing or nodding your head while your girlfriend or wife is watching, I can suggest some good pillows for you for when you're sleeping on the couch tonight. Anyways, Garin used this product, but it isn't anywhere near as nice as the salon level products.Is it worth the money?Meh, if you're looking for a cheap ""I'm out of town and forgot my hair gel at home"" solution, this might be it. However, there is nothing wrong with spending the extra dollars needed to get the right product. In life, how you look, is how you sell yourself, so, why do you want to look like you went for the cheaper sell?Will I get this product again in the future?No thanks. I'm sure it's a great product for the market it's intended for, but for me and my household, we will stick with the salon traditional fair.",3
"I had a sample of this stuff that I used on a trip to Disney World (in September). At the time I'd started using several new products so I couldn't figure out what was making the difference, but my hair, which normally has a halo of fuzzy frizz in humidity, would, at worst, curl and wave (which it does naturally). It was actually a better product for letting my naturally wavy hair do what it wants to do and look nice than anything I'd used, and if I used an iron it would keep it smooth, and either way, NO FRIZZ.Even without intense humidity, it makes my hair significantly more manageable. After the sample ran out I realized it had been the difference, since I didn't have a single good hair day without it. Keeps it smoother, holds style better, and much more tolerant of my terrible hair dryer. Just got this full bottle, and I'm sitting here playing with my hair nonstop. Normally my hair is like straw the day I blow-dry it unless I use tons of oils and silicone-based products, but I used only this and a bit of mousse and its light, smooth, silky (but not fake shiny), and looks incredibly healthy.I highly suggest anyone with frizzy, unruly hair try this and switching to a cleansing conditioner (like Wen, but there are cheaper versions). For the first time in my life, I love my thick, wavy hair without having to burn it into submission with an iron. I live in Savannah so the product gets put through the ringer fairly often.",5
Perfect compact size. Hate those other bulky packaging. Color is spot on! I'm dark haired and i use this lighter shade for more natural effect,5

"Was able to get a Buy 1 get 1 50% off to try.  The lotion does feel creamy, but after about 5 minutes my skin felt a little sticky which is ok if you are going to be at home for the rest of the evening.  My favorite body lotions that I have tried so far are Boots No 7 Body Serum, like the BEST, do to it's thick, velvety texture that lasts for hours and makes your skin look dewy.  My 2nd favorite is a toss-up Eucerin Smoothing Lotion with AHA's or Vaseline Intensive Stratys Lotion which go on smooth and are not sticky afterwards, but usually wait till it goes on sale.  For a low cost lotion, I liked the Aveeno Baby Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion.  Will still see if I find anything that tops Boots No 7.",3
"This is a great brand and a wonderful product for all skin types!!When you use Organic Rosehip Oil, your actually going to enjoy the benefits of:Re-hydrate dry skinPrevent skin damageHelp attenuate scarsNourish your skinRestore normal skin colorIt really is great and most of all it benefits anyone who has to deal with eczema, brittle nails, age spots, dry skin, acne scars, dry or damaged hair, and a bunch of other issues. I like the fact that your actually using something that doesn't contain harsh chemicals to heal what you need fixed, but instead a natural oil that actually aids in recovery and makes your skin even healthier in the long run. When you can heal your skin with a product that is all natural and is safe for everyone in the family to use, I would suggest it's a great buy!The VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil is at such a great price and comes in such a nice small container for easy portability. You can travel with this product and aid your skin whenever you need too. I found a great use with this product as a hot oil treatment and if you have a flaky scalp this will work to fix that! The scent is light and doesn't really smell at all. As always a little goes a long way, super potent!I actually have a scar on my arm, from a cooking burn. So I figure that with this product I can actually help it heal a bit quicker than it would take without. However, it is good to know that this product will aid in the recovery of the skin, but it also will depend on the age of the scar to know how long it will take.I think this is a great product, and even tho its not known like Argan oil, Emu oil, or any other oil out there, it is still a terrific product and should be recommended in most dermatologist offices.",5
"I love these face masks. Feel real good on my skin. I recommend to anyone, woman and men that want soft skin. I purchase these on a regular basis.",5
"This lathers well, smells nice, and has not caused my color to fade.  It may possibly be maintaining the color; it seems to me that my roots are not as visible!",4
"So much better than any other eye pencil brand I've used.  The blade is strong and perfectly aligned.  Ironically, I bought it to sharpen the intense liner by loreal and it's so soft, even this sharpener causes it to break off.  Every other pencil I own, is much better sharpened, though.",5
"Okay almost all detangling comb works , don't they? Well...idk but this one does for sure. I promise. I bought this because I didn't want to used my fingers to detangle my wet hair anymore, and brushes were just breaking the hair apart, and this was a wide-tooth comb. Also seeing that I have prime it got here in two days. So yeah..good buy. I don't know what else to say. Except that if I were you I'd take a look at my local supply store they could easily have it cheaper- but then again this isn't that costly so do as you wish.",5
"I got this because I was hoping sulfate-free products would help with my dandruff.  It doesn't, but I still love this shampoo.The moment I rinse this out, my hair is smooth and tangle free.  It lathers very generously so I don't need to use a lot with my long hair.  The smell is fantastic.  Even when I don't use the conditioner my hair feels amazing.Would buy again.",5
The perfect affordable concelear. It works perfect for me getting rid of my dark circles I would definitely buy again when I run out.,5
"I heard about this product from an acquaintance of mine. I didn't believe that it could be such a amazing product. I have long thick Middle Eastern hair that is semi curly and I didn't think any brush could tame it. I have never been so wrong! This product worked wonders. I use it all the time I bought my sister one. I no longer have any problems with tangles. It don't hurt as much at all. There is little pain or stress of having so many overwhelming tangles anymore. I had to coat my hair in conditioner and then brush it out. Now I can just go in the shower and brush it without using loads of conditioner to untangle it. I absolutely love this product and show it to everyone. My friend liked it so much she bought one as well. Brilliant product. I don't care much for the ratings that involved children. I am an adult I wanted it for myself and it works, period.",5
"This is a smooth nice lip pencil, but the color I ordered (Plush Red) was too red for me. I really like the pencil, but in a different color.",3
"After applying Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner and letting sit in my hair a few minutes, I could feel how tangle free and silky my hair felt while rinsing it out.  Thee is not an overwhelming smell and the aroma of argan oil is not to strong.  Followed it with Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Argan Styling Oil, blow dried and styled as usual.  My hair was soft, fizz-free, bouncy, shiny and manageable.I have been using products with argan oil for years now. Argan oil comes from the nut that is taken out of the fruit from the argan tree that are found mostly in southern Morocco. I am Latina and have thick dry hair. Argan oil hair products helps to naturally restore the moisture to the hair cuticle, helps tame frizz and reduce the appearance of split ends, and adds shine that last all day long. Besides taming your locks, it will also help counter the damaging effects of heat from flat irons and blow dryers.I would definitely recommend this conditioner to anyone who has dry dull hair that needs some shine and life back into it.  It is economical and works as advertised.",4
"The brush is amazing. Great shipping, super fast that's one of the reasons I love ordering from amazon. However I am new to order and apparently I got 2 brushes when I only wanted one. Nevertheless the brush is amazing so I dnt regret it.",5
"These wipes are dryer than a lot of similar products, which is fine by me since i don't want my face to feel slimy and wet, just clean. If you're expecting something sopping with moisture, this product won't make you happy.I don't wear make-up, so i can't speak to the make-up removing qualities of these wipes. What i've used them for is giving my face a quick once over after riding in a hot car. The damp wipes feel cool and nice, and they mop up a little bit of sweat to make me look ever so slightly more presentable.I wouldn't use them in any other context, though. I don't need to use a moisturizer after cleaning my face with these, but they do make my skin feel, if anything, slightly rougher. That's not what i expected from a wipe with a 'light exfoliate [sic]'.And as for sensitive skin, i do not break out in a rash after using these, so they get my skin's stamp of approval. Most Simple brand products have been kind to my fickle skin, and this one was no different.",3
"Exactly what we needed for quick application of sun protection before heading out for working in the yard.  Definitely aManly scent, but worked as a sporty scent for me also.  I personally loved the ease of application, and full coverage protection, so nice not to have become lobster red after stacking 3 cords of wood on a sunny day.  My husband would have preferred a spray lotion (don't know that they have something like that) so I took off one star because of that, in my book it's a 5 star.",4
"I love all the instanaturals products, I am using a lot of their products & they all live up to the description. This oil is deeply hydrating, I use it in my hair,  & I also use it for my baby's dry skin, I don't have to worry since its organic & 100% pure, no weird smell, his skin feesl great moisturised, & there hasn't been any reaction, so I am continuing it.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href=""http://www.tomoson.com/?code=BOTTOM467708c5c44ba3c32f4ae769d08dfe96"" rel=""nofollow"">Tomoson.com&lt;/a>. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.",5
"I just recently purchased the QMD Derma Roller and I must say that I am very excited to see what it can do for my skin. I used it for the first time a few days ago on half of my face. The VERY next morning I noticed a difference! I kid you not! The side of my face that I had rolled felt tighter and my pores looked smaller. I do have some shallow acne scars (impressions) on my cheeks and temples and even those looked less noticeable.  I cannot wait to see the long term results. As far as pain, it does hurt and feels uncomfortable, initially. However, after a few rolls, you become accustom to the pain more and more. I also want to try adding a bit more pressure when I'm rolling because I felt that since it was my first time, and I didn't know what to expect, I went very gentle and light. But the more pressure you can endure, without bleeding, the more you will penetrate those areas and hopefully see improvement! I definitely recommend this product and I'm excited to see the long term results. Oh, and definitely, definitely use a Vitamin C serum, makes a world of difference.",5
"I have my hair colored every 2-3 months with highlights, low lights, and a toner that take my dirty blonde hair to a brighter blonde.  In between visits to the salon my hair color can become a bit dull and lackluster without any maintenance so I try to take steps to maintain its color as best as possible.  Typically that has meant using pigmented shampoos once or twice a week (I've tried a few and have foundKevin Murphy Blonde Angel Wash 8ozto be the best and most effective) as well as making sure my shampoos and conditioners are free of sulfates.  I thought this would be an interesting product to try to supplement my current routine.I will admit that while I am clear on what this treatment is intending to do (preserve the look of color treated hair) I'm not 100% clear on what the product actually is or how it compares to other things on the market.  My stylist has told me that in the salon world, gloss & toner are interchangeable, but from using this product, the results don't seem to be as dramatic as when I have a toner applied in a salon.  Granted, this is probably for the best because salon toners/glosses do seem to require a bit of no how to apply and I'm not sure I would feel competent enough to do one.  However, I do think this is worth mentioning so you can set your expectations accordingly.That said, I was happy with the results.  I do think this does a good job of extending the look of salon color, even though I don't think it is a substitute for a treatment done in a salon.  In my case I applied it regularly after having my hair colored, even though it didn't show fading/dullness since I've always seen the best results when I've been more proactive with pigmented shampoos vs. waiting until my hair already looks bad.  Using the product this way, I was happy with the results.  However, I can't say how it compares if you apply it to hair that is already dull or faded, though my personal experience is that by that point you often need a professional treatment.  I know this is how the marketing seems to suggest using it, but to expect a noticeable bump at that point seems like an over promise.Overall with the way I used it I was satisfied and would use it again in the future.",4
"I love that this palette has such a variety in colors. It makes it perfect for mixing and matching to make a perfect match for your skin. I think it's an amazing deal, and won't let you down.",5
"I feel like this actually made my fine lines worse. I don't actually have a lot of wrinkles. I have two kids under 4, so I am asleep deprived, and I use wrinkle cream to make my eyes look more refreshed after a night of NO sleep. This didn't work at all.",2
"The bottoms of my feet are very callused and rough. I've tried a pumice stone, a metal file made for foot calluses and that goofy electric thing to try to get them smooth. But nothing seemed to work well until the Profoot Ped-Rock Flexible Callus foot file made its way to me thru the Amazon Vine Program.This foot file works like no other I have tried before this. It files the foot in a gentle way so I don't make a mistake and wound my foot. It fits easily into my hand and is easy to manipulate around the foot to file off more areas. I love this.If you have rough, callused feet, I recommend the Profoot Pedi-Rock Flexible Callus Foot File highly. It is a great product.",5
"When I was a teenager, I would pull off hundreds of blackheads every week with Biore strips.In My old age, my blackheads have not gone away, but I found these Ultra strips to be less capable than the regular strips.  Two applications only managed a dozen or so blackheads.",2
"Note: I bought this product direct from Clinique in a local mall, as I wanted to be able to return it or exchange it if I experienced any problems.Started using this oil-free gel moisturizer one week ago, and voila! No new breakouts! And the areas that were experiencing breakouts, calmed down.No redness, no itching, no irritation. And my skin isn't flaking anymore, either. That's amazing.ALL other oil-free and sensitive skin lotions and creams, have either not been moisturizing enough or have caused instant breakouts. Not sure which ingredient is the worst offender, but suspecting it was either lanolin or mineral oil, tried to switch to items not containing those.I even used Roc and tried prescription sensitive skin lotions and creams, plus expensive department store brands, to no avail.Turned out to be a lot harder than I thought it would be, to ditch the irritating oils. They seem to be the base for lots of different binders and liquids used in many brands and forms of makeup, including face powder, eyeliner, eye shadow, concealer, etc. And different names are used for the different forms they take. I'm not a chemist, so I was often fooled/confused.This gel form goes on easily, not heavily, and leaves no greasy/slick or tight/dry feel to the skin. Your skin feels soothed and hydrated, not wet or sticky.This gel is not inexpensive drugstore stuff, and it's not a luxury. It's affordable, and it works.I need to go back and get more. I will be looking for a carry-along or packable tube, too, as this square container is a bit too heavy for my small travel purse and carry-on bag.",4
"I really like the way this lotion goes on! It rubs in so easily and leaves no sticky residue. The smell is almost nonexistent, which is far better than having an annoying scent. It works well in the sun when I bike--I do not burn. I intend to keep using this and will report back if there are any problems. Thus far I like it very much.",4
"It does makes my hair shiny , even only after one use ! But I didn't get the clean feeling , I still felt my hair dirty or had a weird smell I can't exactly describe it.I used both the shampoo and conditioner .The bottles didn't come sealed properly , so it was spilt a little bit .",3
"I first stumbled into the world of essential oils back in 1990 when I needed a part-time job and there was an opening for ""Weekends Only"" at a tiny Aromatherapy store in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Back in those days, very few people had even heard of the word and thought FRAGRANCE oils to be synonymous with ESSENTIAL OILS.  It was an invaluable experience working in that store and it changed my life in regards to taking charge of my PERSONAL wellness through the use of Essential Oils.NO DRUG IS A PANACEA OR MAGIC BULLET FOR EVERYONE!!!! I state this clearly because of the few negative reviews that all the various company's that sell Tea Tree Oil have received. For instance, I'm allergic to Peroxide. The pills Asprin and Tylenol have zero effect on me. So, if you have NEVER used Tea Tree Oil, BUY THE SMALLEST BOTTLE YOU CAN FIND AND TRY IT OUT ON YOURSELF! If you're as lucky as I am, it will be your Go-To Treatment for 99% of ""What Ails You.""I've tried many a company's Tea Tree Oil and have finally settled on THIS brand. Why? The reasons I list work for ME; they may not work for YOU:1) It's in a CLEAR bottle! I know, I know: having E.O.'s in blue/amber bottles protects them from the light, but so does storing them in a dark place. I like being able to SEE how much is used so I know when to buy more.2) It does NOT have a calibrated ""Rain Drop"" apeture in the top, meaning that you can POUR the oil out or use these micro measuring spoons when creating hair or bath products.Norpro 3080 Mini Measuring Spoons, 5 Piece Set3) PRICE!!!!! Compared to other company's with fancier labels and prettier bottles, this product is several dollars LESS expensive than the other brands, without losing a bit of effectiveness.4) Availability!!!! Since this product does NOT ship through Amazon Prime, there's no cost savings to me. Both my local Whole Foods and Trader Joe's sell this brand, so I am no more than a 10 minute drive in any direction when I am running low.Okay, those are the reasons why I buy THIS brand. Now, HOW do I use it and HOW has it helped me?1) For my body, Tea Tree Oil is Magical!!! Every single thing that you can find online with HOW this oil works, it responds that well in MY body! YOUR results may vary. Since discovering the sheer effectiveness on my system, I keep no less than SIX bottles in our lives: in my purse; in our first aid kits; and in every medicine cabinet. My family has been taught by me that Tea Tree Oil is thee FIRST response to ANYTHING that breaks the skin and it's kept our medical bills down to ZERO. Yes, ZERO!!!, in regards to the common things you go to the doctor for.2) I have had chronic and debilitating ear infections my entire life. As a child, I've spent weeks in hospital with infections that threatened my life. Countless surgeries on my ears have done NOTHING to stop the infections, which can come on in an hour. Now, as soon as I feel the Tell-Tale tingling in my ear, I grab my bottle of Tea Tree Oil and swipe it down the entire side of my face. I repeat this process every single hour until the tingling stops. Results? NO MORE EAR INFECTIONS AND NO MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS OR DOCTOR VISITS!!!3) When my family and I have a scratchy throat or have been subjected to anyone with a severe cold or the flu, we place a couple of drops on a cotton pad and then deeply inhale the vapors and hold it in our lungs for the count of five, then exhale and repeat the process. Since doing this, NO ONE in my family has had a cold or the flu in 8 years!!!! NO ONE!4) We have a Summer Cottage near a lake which means ticks, chiggers and mosquitoe bites. One drop of this oil on ANY of the following solves the itch, the pain and the resulting infections. We've seen ticks actually back out of the skin when a drop of this oil is placed on their backs!5) Tooth infections! I had four Wisdom Teeth extracted. After it was okay to rinse my mouth, I placed a drop of Tea Tree Oil in warm water and would rinse out my mouth when directed. When I went in for my check up, my dentist was SHOCKED at the healing of my gums and was suspicious as to WHY they had healed so well and so fast! Seriously, Dr.? Shouldn't you have just been HAPPY for me? LOL6) And for me, directly, the use of Tea Tree Oil in my daily job is a God Send! I'm a Landscape Architect with a staff of 17 men. Every single day, we get injured; it comes with the job. Whether it's a deep penetration of a thorn, a complete scraping of skin from a tree you're climbing, a deep knick when you're sharpening a pruner, or a massive sliver that got jammed into a palm, we have daily injuries. Since we can't stop work when this happens, we normally would just rinse the area off with a hose and continue working. More than half of the time, these injuries would get worse, with either the employee or myself loosing productivity or hours, because we couldn't use that hand or arm.Now, I've taught every one of my guys to come to me for treatment and they hold out their injury to receive some drops of Tea Tree Oil. At first, they were skeptical; now, some are SO convinced, they've had me buy bottles for their own homes. And for home use, this oil is amazing! I've had deep knife cuts from a knife slipping out of my hands while washing; I've had deep scratches from our dogs and cats when we've tried to corral them for the vet; and 100% of these injuries NEVER get infected nor turn pink or swollen if treated immediately with this oil. Healing time is 3-5 times faster than when left untreated.We've used this oil for acne, cold sores, tooth aches, ear infections, athlete's foot, insect bites and all manner of skin breaks. For whatever reasons, our DNA works with this oil. That's why I'm giving it such glowing reviews. YOUR results may NOT be the same.In closing, I'd recommend that you buy the smallest bottle possible, to keep it fresh and pure. In my home and purse, I buy the .05 ounce size and when it's half full, I buy a replacement bottle and store it in the frig. Remember, NOTHING that you put to the opening is sterile (cotton balls, swabs or your fingers!), so with each touch of the oil, you are contaminating it. So, buying a large 2 ounce bottle just allows the oil to become less and less effective. The one exception for me, is that for work I buy the 2 ounce bottle, simply because we go through one of those bottles at least once a month and it's more cost effective.Also, if you want to learn about more health benefits of essential oils, THIS book is the BEST there is!Aromatherapy: A Complete Guide to the Healing ArtI've been using this book since it was first published in 1995 and use it as my ""Betty Crocker"" default for healing common injuries and problems within my family. It's NEVER failed me in 18 years of use.",5
I love Argan Oil!  My hairdresser introduced me to this product at the salon after my Brazilian Blowout and I fell in love with it.  It works great to speed up drying my hair and it makes it very soft and shiny.,5
"I would give this 4 stars if it had not come in a glass bottle.  This was very difficult to get the vitamin E oil out because it was so sticky.  So I had to shake the jar with my hand and in the process, it broke and shattered all over my bathroom.  The worst part was how it shattered in my hand and cut me pretty badly.  Most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle.",2
"I have my doubts about any wrinkle creams. But I received the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum from Amazon Vine, so I decided to try it out on my fine lines. After weeks of use though, there were no noticeable results. To be fair, I have no wrinkles yet but it claims to work on fine lines as well. Another negative for me was the awful pump design. Trying to push down the metallic pump was difficult, as you have to get it at just the right angle for it to go down. Which, by then, means your pushing hard and can accidentally squeeze too much out of it and make a mess. I like the Neutrogena brand for lotions, but this product didn't do anything for me.",2
"This cleanser does take off your makeup quite well and leaves your face feeling great.  BUT it's a struggle to open the cap!  It is SO tight I have to take a towel and wrap it around the top and give it a lot of strength and force it off -- what a pain.  It also tastes horrible should you accidentally get a tiny bit around your lips -- I've never noticed this with other cleansers.  I certainly haven't noticed any ""anit-aging"" effects, but didn't really expect to.",3
I'm not all that impressed.  I was excited to get these because I thought it would be a great alternative to the safety pin I have used since puberty to separate my eyelashes.  I tried these several times after applying mascara and they just didn't do that great of a job at separating my lashes.  I ended up going back to my trusty safety pin.  I do like the size and the fact that they fold up to protect the teeth.  Product was in excellent condition and packaging was excellent.  Nothing works like my safety pin.,3
I used this product in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo and I found that as a conditioner it has performed flawlessly on my thick hair.  I worry though that this may weigh down those with thinner hair or curly hair.  It made my hair very smooth and soft and easy to manage.  It could be a bit more smooth as I still had some tangles to battle but overall it's a good product that does the job!,4
"FINALLY finally finally something that has helped me IMMENSELY! I've been doing the 20% Salicylic acid peel every few days (maybe every three) and using this cleanser once every other day. I can't even express how much this has helped! I used to get quite large, itchy, PAINFUL cystic acne on my face, especially on my jawline, but since my insurance has changed and no longer covers anything for half of the year, I certainly couldn't afford to go to my dermatologist and spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on prescriptions (which were usually ineffective after a few months anyway) and face washes that didn't work. I searched around on Amazon and came across this stuff. Can't even say how much it's helped! Definitely start with this wash - I truly think the wash made ALL the difference when used in conjunction with the peel! I use it every other day to maintain my skin. It can be a little drying, especially on my chin, so I don't always use the peel/wash on my chin area, but it has helped my jawline sooooooo much! That's not to say that I have picture-perfect model skin, but it is sooooooo much better than when I started! And hey, I've only used up half of the bottle of peel and half the bottle of cleanser since I bought them both two months ago, so I'm looking at spending about forty bucks every four months - not a bad deal at all!",5
"Eyebrows are important, and this gel is a must. I use it every morning and it lasts all day as long as you don't mess with your brows! Highly recommend.",5
"My issue with co-washing was that my left always ended up still feeling dirty and gunky. Not with this! My hair feels clean, and isn't trying. Perfection!",5
"I have constipation type IBS and this works for me.  The first thing I noticed was that I wasn't as bloated.  Not alot of relief, but just enough to keep on giving it a try.  It took about 2 months to get the full effect.Without it, I am really constipated, but with it things work alot better.  I use the chewable tablets.",5
"I think these brushes deserve all what were said about them I am so in love , now I am planning to try the face brushes too",5
"This moisturizer has a very odd odor and stings a bit on the skin.  The cream has apple stem cells-all the rage in Europe for use in non-invasive anti-aging therapy.  Apple stem therapy should come from a certain rare type of apple from Switzerland in order to reap the true benefits, and this cream claims to use those same apples.I'm using this moisture therapy but I have not seen any real change to my skin.  It works fine as a moisturizer, and aside for the odor and slight stinging sensation, I have no other irritation to my skin.  I'm going to continue using it but I can't say it's done anything great.",4
i got this for a great deal and i gotta say im glad i got this for cheap cuz this is ok but it makes my hair feel weird and sticky..maybe its just me but it makes my hair feel tacky like i have to much product in my hair..even if i use a very small amout..i like the silky smooth soft look..this isnt horrible and it does protect but there are better flat iron heat protectants out there..i will be using this as a back up..,3
"I thought I'd get the one you can buy at Wal-mart while I waited for this one to ship but I am SOOOOO glad I tried the Konad also because it is SO much easier to use! The other is rounded and harder to use the konad is flat and SO easy. I almost gave up using the other so I love love love love love this stamper. Softer rubber,wider rubber, and flatter. ++++++ Wish I could find the plates near me tho I am addicted !",5
"This is good for a carry-on bag, and because it can be completely stuffed inside the zipper pocket, it's good for those who might want to bring a small bag on a trip, knowing they will expand it and fill it with goods acquired on the trip. It's certainly not all things to all people, and the material doesn't look nearly thick enough to withstand a lot of rugged use, but I think it's fine for its limited use ... something to carry light items on a flight, overnight trip, picnic, etc.",4
"If you've never brushed your long hair with a large paddle brush, you're missing out. I can't even explain it but I use to think all brushes were the same. This brush feels heavenly and leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.",5
"I orinally thought this was the leave in conditioner, but it doesn't matter love it still.  Gives my hair much slip.  I love the way it makes it feel.",5
"I received this product in a box and bubble wrap unharmed. I waited to write this review until I had used the product long enough that I seen results. I like AzureNaturals serums. My friends have noticed the lines on my forehead have greatly diminished and have been asking what my secret was. I told them I started using AzureNaturals Ultimate C. It isn't irritating at all, does not feel drying, and I would feel a tightening of my skin within a few seconds after application. I use the product on my face and neck and even under my eyes. I let it dry which only take a few seconds then put my moisturizer on and sometimes makeup over it depending if I have things to do that day. The lines around my lips and the lines on my forehead have diminished greatly and my face looks brighter. My pores are even smaller which is great since my pores have been really big lately. I think I look a lot younger than I am and I'm only 23.  I have tried different Vitamin C serums to see what one I liked the most and which one you get more out of for your buck. I did some research on the ingredients in each of the serums I have tried. I really like the consistency in Azure Naturals Vitamin C. The way it makes your skin feel and there's no smell plus the results you have after using it. A couple of the serums I have tried I swear they are just water with maybe if even 2% vitamin c in it. I also like that it can be a dropper or a pump. I really love the pump it makes life so much easier when your in a rush just pump and go. Highly recommend for people women or men.",5
I bought this because my pit bull hates baths. It does the trick because my dog sits still when I apply this to her.,5
My wife loves this shampoo. It smells really good and she says it doesn't wash out her color. She has been using this for over 4 weeks with good results. This is a good product developed for people who dye their hair.,5
"Great color pay off, last a really long time, i use the black one tu fill in my brows:) great eyeshadows overall",5
"I love this foundation, it blends very easily, it has such a great coverage, just use a teeny tiny bit and you will be good. My skin looks flawless and amazing, I totally love it. I have dry skin, I used a moisturizer and then a primer, and it worked like magic, it is my favorite indeed!I see myself re-purchasing this over and over, it is well worth the price.",5
"I received this Hempz product from a friend for a birthday gift.  Pretty funny, since I don't smoke dope, and yet this product is made from a marijuana leaf-clearly visible- on the product!  I was apprehensive, and then tried it and LOVED the smell.  I have tried 3 different scents from Hempz line and have enjoyed all three of the smells/odors!  I recommend this product to most anyone, unless you have a great sensitivity to odors, if so you may not like this product!  Personally, I LOVE IT!",5
"I could feel the difference on my husband's blackhead-filled back after just one use.  It was much smoother and softer, with fewer blackheads.  We use it with a salycilic body wash, and scrub acne-prone chest and back.",4
"I like this kit it being my first. I really don't have any complaints about this kit. No shedding, the smell is a factory smell. People reviews on here are exaggerated. I still find myself using my old brushes because they pack on my product better. The brushes are very very soft which makes it longer to apply my makeup. Besides that I Definitely recommend!!!",4
"This stuff feels so pleasant going on and makes your skin feel so silky!  I would wear it even if I wasn't wearing makeup.  I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  The worst part is that covering acne spots and scars is almost impossible.  If I use concealer, it just dries out and looks caked and clumpy. I can't wear lipstick at all, only Aquaphor.  This stuff really seems to help smooth out my skin so I don't have these issues.  I still need my moisturizer, but this works with it to keep my makeup looking great! The bottle is tiny, but you don't need to use a lot.  For the price, it's still a steal.",5
"I literally put this lipgloss on this morning at about 11oclock and did not have to reapply until about 3. That's saying alot since i snacked in this lipgloss, drank, and then ate a meal. It still wasn't all the way gone when i reapplied but i wanted the color back so i reapplied. These glosses are great, I don't know why I am just now getting into these. I have tanned, miami babe, beige and this one. I must say this one is my favorite. It's frosty and i usually don't like frosty lips since i am dark skinned but this is just the right amount of color and frost together and it gives me a really nice peachy pink lip :D this gloss is very thick though, so that's probably a contributor to the staying power.I usually have to wipe off a ton of product off the brush before applying. But it still gives me opaque peachy pink lips that are to die for. I love these glosses and will continue to buy more.",5
Well when I ordered I didnt pay attention and didnt realize that these where face brushes and not eye brushes. I havent used them as much as you would think but I do use some of them for blending. I have a different set of RC brushes and I love them. This is a good product and good brand but I just happen to by the wrong style of brush. Im sure i will find good use for them tho.,4
"I really like this lipstick. It goes on smooth and basically looks like lip gloss with a rich color. I just received it so I didn't try it out to see how long it would last, but when I tried it on initially, I totally was impressed.",4
"Target had one of these for a LOT more money - lets be honest what is the point of spending much more for an item that does exactly the same thing? There is no point in that at all. The small one is a bit difficult to use on ones own head - but the bigger one can be used just as well. For the price and some research of videos on what you can do for hairstyles, its worth it!",3
This product is okay. The wash and eye cream lasts longer than the moisturizer. It was comparable to most stores. It is no miracle product though.,3
My step daughter told me I needed one of these. She was right. It is a must have. Blends everything really well.,5
"This shampoo is good. I have very curly hair - that I straighten - which seems to dry it out a bit.  Moroccanoil shampoo leaves my hair nice, moist, and not dry.  not ""fly away"".  Expensive, but i'm hooked now.",5
"Very pretty silver sparkle, definitely not ment to be opaque, but it looks great over a base of midnight caller.",5
"This hair balm is surprising lightweight.  I was expecting this to be a heavy, gooey, greasy experience, however I am pleasantly surprised and happy to report that this actually helps to tame my dry color treated hair.  I color quite often due to the battle of the gray.  I use this on the ends of my hair prior to drying and straightening my hair.  The result, silky smooth healthy looking hair.  Easy to apply, but use sparingly a little goes a long way.",5
I love it. It has everything you need for your daily makeup routine. 18 shadows is such a great selection. And what a cute little mascara!,5
"My fav lotion, I won't ever change unless they stop selling It, hope they don't stop selling it, great great",5
"This is a nice, light moisturizer, and I appreciate that it is fragrance-free.I received this from Amazon, along with the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel and the Simple Soothing Facial Toner.I'm very happy with all three products.Only caveat for this moisturizer: it's not as moisturizing as other day or night creams I've tried. If you don't have really dry skin, this moisturizer will work for you. If you have more dryness (or if your skin gets very dry and chapped in the winter), you might want to try a more intensive moisturizer.Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 Ounce (Pack of 2)Simple Soothing Facial Toner, 6.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)",5
"Product received as advertised. Came pretty quick, fast shipping, packaged well. Some of the companies have been sending me half full things to where the photo doesn't match what was being advertised, but this wheel came pretty full and matched the photo that was displayed. Colors are even in the same spot.",4
"I love these!!! Only flaw? It doesn't say in the manual in how much time do they reach the max heat, which for rebel hair like mine is very important info, so i just let them heat up for like 5 min and then unplug one at a time and let them do their job for as long as i have time to let them on, first time in 15 minutes i was a curly queen! Love it!!",5
"Definitely a fan of Olay's new product line!  This is well formulated and gentle- have experienced no break-outs, (comedones a.k.a.  pimples) rashes or skin discolorations.Olay's products work better than and have beat out much higher priced face creams-La Prairie, Shiseido, Clinique, Alizabeth Arden, Lancome, etc.Olay has gone way beyond that old pink Oil of Olay moisturizing fluid of yesteryear!Will update when it is used longer. So far, so good. It's a keeper!",5
"I wash my hair about every other day, and I used to wear a towel. One day I looked up shower caps and thought this was perfect-- and it really was! My husband loved it when he saw it, which only made it better! Very good purchase!",5
"Pores smaller, skin glowing, LOVE this stuff.  I tried going without it (because of the cost) and people kept asking me if I was tired.  :/  So, worth the cost in my opinion.  I use it on clean skin, before my moisturizer.  Very little in the wildly hyped world of women's skincare is the real deal, but this is one of the ones that lives up to it's promises.",5
let me start by saying that i live in the middle east so i knew that anything i order would take time until i receive it but this lipstick melted completely i mean i couldn't even save the lipstick .it is not the first time i order lipsticks i order before and i received them with no problems .if i could give this seller and product less then one star i would i am so angry because it is expensive and i had to throw it in the garbage .,1
"I have several palettes recently acquired by Shany that I have been trying out for several weeks.  I have fair, 40-something skin.  I wasn't sure if I would like an entire palette of shimmers, but found it is one of my favorites.  Here is a review for this particular palette.Pros:Pigmentation:  Very highly pigmented.  A little does go a long way.Shimmer:  These have a very nice shimmer, but not glittery.Application:  I use eyeshadow brushes and an inexpensive shadow primer.  The color goes on very smoothly and does not require numerous applications for the color is so good.Price:  The price is very reasonable compared to high-end products.  This 88-color palette costs not much more than one shadow from a high-end store.  Shipping is free using Amazon Prime.  If ordered directly from Shany, shipping is free with $50 purchase and they give you free full-size samples.  They also offer you deals on their website when you are looking at items (I got a buy 2, get 1 free on palettes).Variety:  The color choice is superb, with shimmers from bright to neutral with many nice highlighting shades.Packaging/Shipping:  Comes in a black, glossy case with the Shany logo embossed in gold.  It is easy to open and snaps shut.  It comes from Amazon or Shany (if ordered from them) double-bubble wrapped in a box.  Arrived in perfect condition with no breakage.Cons:Pot size:  Pots are about the size of a dime, but the color is so good it should last a long timePalette size:  Rather bulky if you want to take it with you everywhere.Fragile:  Other reviewers have had broken shadows when they drop their palettes or bump them too hard.Origin:  Though shipped from U.S., product says made in China.  I am not sure which components are from China.Overall, I am very happy with this shimmer palette.  The colors are beautiful, going on smoothly and staying all day.  When I use a primer and a brush, I have very little fall-out.  For the price, I feel this and other Shany palettes are definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend trying them.  On a side note, I have eye sensitivities with colors containing reds (red, violet, etc), but have noticed less problems with this particular line.  If you enjoy shimmers, there is quite a variety of tones to work with and they apply beautifully.",5
"Finally, finally, finally.........a MATTE CREAM eyeshadow in a neutral color!  Believe it or  not........matte cream eyeshadow is nearly impossible to find!  I ordered a silver tattoo a while back, but it was &#34;sparkly&#34;........I hope that Mabelline continues this product forever.  I love the taupe but would also like this in a true brown.",5
"We just LOVE the Tan Towels!!!  Been using them for YEARS, however, just wish they weren't SO expensive  : )",5
nessessary to work withbut need more for much idea and planning to make some money on the side.this could become a great money maker.,5
This is probably better for the beach where there are no bees.  I wore it to the park and the bees loved me.  It smells good and goes on easy.,4
"Love this mousse! It is a little thicker than typical mousse (looks like whipped cream, the name is no exaggeration). I have long, thick hair and only need a little. It helps a lot with frizz. I will keep buying",5
"We tried this shampoo on colored hair of adult female and fine hair of teenage boy. The result was quite nice on the teenage boy's hair because they naturally try to avoid conditioners. This conditioning shampoo smells good and softens hair without making it look greasy. On colored hair, it is more tricky. We usually need a LOT of conditioner to make it smooth, so it is not the shampoo's fault. It is generic enough to be great for natural hair and probably more greasy hair that dry colored.",4
I have really bad acne. I am 22 and have had acne since I was 12/13. From all that acne came scaring and really bad uneven skin. It was so bad I would hate to go out in public and put pounds of makeup on my face to hide it. This has made my pores smaller just after 3 uses!! It has also helped with my acne and the scaring. This stuff it AMAZING!!,5
"I was looking for nice tiny round rhinestones and these are perfect!!  I don't like gaudy looking nails, but these are vibrant enough to stand out but not huge and tacky looking.. the shipping is a little long coming from China but that's okay.  :) Cheap, but nice product.  Very pleased.",5
"The Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo has a nice lather with a light refreshing scent. It didn't take much shampoo to give me a full head of suds. I thought it worked well to clean my color treated hair. I didn't think it did much to give my hair volume. Overall, nice product.",4
"These are exactly what I've been trying to find! The case they come in is very nice, and well designed! The rhinestones are very colorful as well! Great Product!!!",5
"I like my hair short and naturally spiky during warmer weather.  This Axe Spiking Gel is easy to apply to damp hair, goes on clear,  and is effective in grooming my spiked up hair throughout the day.  My family, co-workers, and I are accustomed to the Axe hair gel scent which is pleasant and masculine.  Like all spike gels with a strong hold, my hair gets a bit stiff and crunchy by the end of the day but this gel washes right out with any shampoo.",4
"This is a very good product.  You have to be consistent and use a lot.  I had terrible cystic body acne on my chest, they were red and painful and really deep all over my chest.  I have tried Salicylic acid products but they don't go deep enough to treat.  So I decided to give this a try.  Twice a day, use about 3 pumps to cover the center area of my chest and wait and let it dry completely.  This took about 3 bottles(3 months) to completely get rid of all the acne on my chest.  Occasionally my skin will get flaky and dry and itchy I will use a salicylic acid toner first to wipe and exfoliate the dead skins off, apply  this lotion let it dry and then apply a moisturizer.  Shipping is more expensive and takes a while, but I found a cheaper alternative on amazon just search 2.5% Benzoyle Peroxide it comes in a 16 oz bottle just like this one and is cheaper.  I found it works just as well, it leaves a white film when the lotion dries unlike Acne.org lotion, but it doesn't really bother me, I apply a moisturizer over it and it is gone.  Over all this is the only thing that helped with my body acne.  The key is use A LOT, twice a day, and make sure it dries before you put on your clothes and you will see results.",4
I've heard about using clay for better health for years and finally decided to give it a try. Wow!  This feels great on. Cooling and soothing. Try it you'll like it.,5
"never bought this before but I wanted to make lotions bars and it did the job perfectly..nothing to compare it to since its the first time I used it, but its got to be the real deal the way it performs",4
"I have hair almost to my elbows, so to my dismay, I had to stop using the ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair method"", because my hair is about two inches two long now :(.....  (I'll explain it in a sec.)  So, I started doing pin curls, rag curls, and every type of overnight ""setting"" curl I could do, because my hair simply does not hold curl from heat.  After buying pretty much every type on the market, including the cheap version of these,  I've finally settled with this product.Pros: No heat, fairly comfortable, cute leopard print (so my husband doesn't totally run for the hills, yes, I can be cute with these... sort of), Snap clasp makes these worth purchase, you don't have to use any clips or pins.  These seem really durable and sturdy, and can be washed in the machine.  I don't like little frizzy ringlets, so I put more hair on each stick, and get big full curls, like you would from a set of jumbo rollers.Cons: You will get better at putting them in with a little time.  The first time I used them, I didn't follow directions and interlock each stick, so I used some pin curl clips to hold them in place, which isn't really necessary if you follow directions.  One of the snaps was right on the pressure point of the back of my head, and was a little uncomfortable through the night (my bad).  You really need to dampin the hair AND use some form of product if you have thicker hair atleast.... The curls are really nice, but they fall if you don't use a product and have heavy hair.OKay.... now to explain the ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair"":You simply take an elastic cloth headband and put it over your head (like a native american, or flapper), with slightly damp hair of course, and some product too, and you simply take the hair and wrap up over and down under the band, adding more hair to that piece as you wrap around to the back.  VERY hard to explain without pictures... for the full picture step by step and video, web search ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair, by broken poet"" and your life will be changed.  It works on all hair types, from cheek length to past the shoulders.  When it gets about elbow length, it's too long.  It literally takes 5 minutes once you get the hang of it, for the most beautiful even curls, I've ever had.  Wish I had known about it all my life. If you use this method, all you need is one cloth headband.  You can get them in packs of 3 from any CVS or Grocery store for a couple of bucks.  I would definitely go that route if my hair wasn't so long.  Good luck!",4
I ran across this when my niece had it on one day. I couldn't believe it wasn't the actual brand! It smells fresh and clean and lasts long. I just got mine early this morning (as of 8/26/13) and It is currently early afternoon. I have not had to reapply of refreshen the scent and it still smells great!,5
"The Blush is very big and lovely colors, how deep I don't know.....delievered on time and the product looks good.",4
"a bit over powering stron not sweet like it shoud be,I certainly was very disapointed with this product,considering the quality of all the other essences",3
"This is wonderful Organic Argan Oil for Hair, Face, and Skin.  My hair, face, and body just drinks in the Argan Oil and makes my wrinkles less obvious and my skin feeling moist without feeling greasy.  I use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows to keep them growing and healthy as well.",5
This stuff is amazing I love this conditioner. Highly recommend!!,5
"The color pigmentation is fantastic, along the lines of MAC and Urban Decay. This is the only palette that I need along with Naked2 to recreate every look possible. I am tempted to purchase the Sleek iDivine OhSoSpecial palette from this brand as well. It has the coral and pink colors that look amazing in the summer season. With shipping, this palette isn't as much of a 'steal' as they brag about in Europe. However, I still find the price reasonable for the quality that you get over drugstore brands.",4
"This fragrance is definitely great for lovers of good smell, quality highlights in the duration in the body and maintains its scent for many hours, recommended",5
When you first spray on some of this perfume it almost has a floral fragrance. But give it a few minutes and it turns warm and powdery. You can't help but feel cozy when wearing this fragrance. You can spray it all over to make your skin smell like fresh soap. This is one of the perfumes my husband doesn't complain about when I wear it. He thinks everything else I use is too strong. So this might be a good option if you usually get headaches from other perfumes.~The Rebecca Review,4
"I purchased these not too long ago. during first time use i found them to be stiff i also had to be quick my applying my foundation, the end result was good though. I am washing a few of them today, i soak them in baby shampoo, squeeze them a few times inside of the soapy water then rinse them a couple of times. the sponges might be less stiff after a good wash.",3
"I carry this in my makeup bag and use it when I travel. It's lightweight without being cheap-feeling. I love being able to see more of my face than in most compact-size mirrors. The 10x magnification is enough for me to put on eyeliner, which needs to be precise, without glasses. Pretty little rhinestone detail on the lid was a nice surprise, too.",5
"Watts Beauty Moisturizing solution (hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and L-arginine) takes cosmetic sera to another level. Usually the effects on the dermis and epidermis are gradual (if at all) but this serum when applied as directed goes a step further - the results on crepe paper-like aging skin and the fullness of the facial skin with this moisturizer and collagen stimulator are seen within days! The erasing of fine lines and wrinkles may take longer but that will be a extra bonus. For aging skin try this product on the skin of the upper arms (that hanging crepe paper we all get or will get and notice the difference. An excellent and safe product. Grady Harp, June 14",5
"It's okay. It moisturizes. It feels a bit oily but that might just be my skin. It is light which I like. Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need. However, it smells like a sunscreen. Also, It looks and feels like a sunscreen to some extent. It is not a real problem, but I don't especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it . I'll probably try something different when I'm done with these two bottles. The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I'm not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for a sunscreen.",3
"When the corresponding shampoo left my hair feeling soothed and smoothed BOTH wet and towel dried, I couldn't wait to see what the conditioner would do. This conditioner made my hair feel the best it's felt in a long while whether blow dried or air dried. My hair was soft and smooth with less frizz. After flat-ironing my hair felt and looked so good, healthy, shiny smooth. What was nice is the flat-ironed style stayed smooth, looking and feeling good 4 days later.  IF my scalp didn't do it's natural oil gushing thing, I would have tried to push it even longer.The conditioner smells and feels nice, spreads and coats the hair easily. It rinses almost completely clean without stickiness or anything that made my scalp act up. A quarter sized amount was enough to work through my shoulder length hair and deliver the impressive results. After flat-ironing, every hair stayed in place, NO FRIZZ! The real test will be is how this holds up during the HOT Texas summer.",5
"I love to do my nails at home, but removal of gel nail polish can be a hassle since the remover needs to sit for so long.  I have tried cotton balls with foil wrapped around them, but it was awkward and could be messy.  These are great!  Just the right size and I can do one hand and then reuse the same wraps for the other hand with no problem.  Good product.",5
"i have combination skin with a particularly oily t-zone, so i purchased this product to help strike a balance with my skin. since i started using these sheets, my t-zone has fewer breakouts as oil no longer pools on my skin and irritates my pores. love it!",5
"This blue is darker,richer,and more saturated than any blue polish I have found. I love it! Now, I have a light, medium, and dark blue to match my wardrobe.",5
This thing is really easy to use and works well.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a facial hydration system.,5
"I love the idea of vanilla scent but when the package came, I was so excited of using it. The smell is overpowering and it gives me headaches.",2
"I would have loved some directions in the package. For instance, how long do you leave it on? How often?",3
i love it so much better than the shany cosmetics makeup pallete there is a shimmer to some colors and the matte so you get the best of both,5
"I really like this face serum. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel heavy or greasy, which turns me completely off with any kind of facial creams or serums. It made my skin feel instantly hydrated, soft, and smooth and the longer I used it the more my face started to stay feeling soft and smooth. I started to notice that my face wasn't as dry as it usually had been and my makeup started to actually look better the longer I used this serum. I have a nice glow to my skin now and I really love it. I really feel like this serum has really made a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I can't wait to see how much better it gets as I continue using it.",5
I was so glad i purchased this product. I always wanted this product it makes my skin feel so nice.,4
"I am 42.  I have age/sun spots, red spots, brown spots, dark under eye circles and large pores on my nose.  This is fantastic as an all over foundation or spot concealer.  I have so many imperfections that I just keep rolling it on.  It goes on so quickly and easily that before I know it I've used it as foundation, though it works perfectly as concealer.  THE APPLICATOR IS GENIOUS.  It is so soft and the liquid comes through in just the right amount to easily blend in a circular motion.  I haven't had any luck applying my normal powder foundation over it, it sticks too much and won't blend well.  So, I've purchased a loose powder to try.  My blush goes on over it with no trouble and my mineral foundation goes on over it w/no trouble.  I've ordered a loose powder to use when I want to use this as a foundation.  All of my red dots, dark spots and circles dissapear quickly and so easily.  I love the application.",5
The 3 jars are a much better deal and love the foam!! After 4 months hair growing in really good!!!,5
"I was so excited to have finally received my purchase after weeks of waiting. I opened the package only to find the wefts were very thin. I was very disappointed. Not only were they thin, but to add to the lack luster experience when I lightly and gently passed my fingers through the pieces, they started to shed. I have yet to wear them because I need another pack for it to look natural. The only positive thing out of the entire experience was that I finally found a great color match. If you are thinking of buying, don't just buy one pack....buy a few!",1
"I've used an electric shaver exclusivley for years now but was never very happy with the smoothness of my legs from it.  There seemed to be a bit of stubble that the electric couldn't get at.  This solves that problem and the moisturization this gives as I shave eliminates the fear of razor burn and scraping that I had experienced from a blade.  My legs are left soft and smooth and there is no greasy feel as I thought there might be.  Best of all, the shave is so close there isn't the slightest hint of stubble and the shave lasts over a week longer than it did with the electric.  I may give up the electric shave for good and switch over to this permanently.",5
"This was a little darker than the color I really wanted, but Essie is nice! I just don't like how the brush is small. But that's not really a big problem. I like it and would recommend it.",4
"So, I've been looking for neutral palettes everywhere, but refuse to spend 80+ on a huge MAC palette. I bought this along with Coastal Scents (for God sakes, don't but the knockoffs on Amazon, they smell like acrylic pants), but I found that the ELF palette creases while the COASTAL SCENTS 28 EYESHADOW NEUTRAL PALETTE is MUCH BETTER. It doesn't crease and doesn't include LOADS of sparkly eyeshadows which I personally don't use very often save for the holidays. If I would get it again, I would still get both because of the AMAZING variety, but I do enjoy the Coastal Palette more! Hope this helps makeup lovers!",4
"This is such a great basic oil cleanser. There are oil cleansers out there being marketed with simaliar ingredients for three times the price -outrageous! I myself have come to love cleansing w/straight mineral oil and grapseed oil as well, but when I'm looking for one with emulsifiers that rinses clean(no film left behind) this is always the one I reach for. For $9 and free shipping here at Amazon it's a steal in my opinion :) -It removes ALL of my long-wearing makeup and daily sunscreen -great stuff!",5
My eyes are sensitive - and my allergies are kicking up - and this eye gel has been gentle and works.Love the ability to use only what I need - and a little goes a long way!,5
"I swear after the first night you see a noticeable difference. My bags got lighter, my eyes looked refreshed. The pump stopped working on the 3rd night but I emailed the company and they got back to me within a half hour saying to just hit the bottom of the tube on a water bottle or something with a top so it'll hit the pump back into place. (After that it never broke again). Great customer service, great product. Even though it's a little pricy I will buy again.",5
"Well Neutrogena has terrific products. Was already using their make-up remover towelettes. As I was ordering those, this popped up... And I said why not? Tried them. Loved them. No, I don't think you heard me: I LOVE THEM!!! But keep these a secret because the secret is out about the towelettes. You've seen the commercial on tv...right? These will be the next best commercial about Neutrogena make-up removers! These are great for just removing make-up from the eyes. The are so soft and gentle, no sting...Just wonderfully effective. They get the job done right! But of course this supplier provides a really incredible price point and amount. So buy, buy, buy!",5
seems to work well.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  Good texture and pleasant smell.  I can feel a difference after just a few uses.,4
Some glitter pieces were too big to even get onto the nail.  Others were too thick and would get caught onto clothing.,1
"I love this shampoo and when you can get it on sale on amazon for this large bottle it is a great deal. In the store these cost around $55 bucks. I tried this once and was hooked, now everytime I use a different conditioner I dont like it because it doesnt give me the same soft and smooth hair as this does! Love it!",5
"My one-year-old daughter has the same dark hair that sticks straight out in every direction that I do.  My wife was keeping it patted down with adult hairspray, but I was always on her case about it.  This Swinging Coconut Hairspray is a nice middle-ground.  It smells pleasant, but not overpowering.  It keeps the hair down, but isn't gummy or heavy or sticky like typical hairspray can be.  You won't get a lot of hold or control out of it, necessarily, but for a child it does the trick!",4
why are all the reviews about some other product ?this is supposed to be about the RoC anti gravity serum.This is not helpful,1
I love magnetic fingernail polish. You can make such neat designs with it and this set comes with some very pretty colors in it. I love the bright green especially.,5
"Solid Black is very, very good - the only reason I couldn't give it five stars was because it still lacks the truly profound bronzing necessary to see results after only a few sessions, however for the price I would argue it is unbeatable. If you don't want to spend the big bucks on the fancier products with tingle factors and all that other garbage, this is absolutely your best bet. Been through multiple bottles now, and the one thing I wanted to include in my review is THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE AN OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS 100X BRONZER AND THE LESSER (around 60X) BRONZERS, so I was very pleased overall with these purchases over the last few months).",4
"I would love to say this works but I did not notice anything.  I guess it is better than rubbing with your finger.  And hey, it is cheap so why not try it.  I will keep it in the cabinet.",1
I have really really really really dry skin.  I cannot emphasize how dry my skin is.  I also have sensitive skin and have been recently transitioning to national products.  I picked this up at a local health food store and I am fairly impressed. It did a fairly good job at removing my makeup but I still used a bit of coconut oil to remove the rest of my waterproof eyeliner. (to be fair i have not met a cleanser yet that can remove it all)  It was very gentle and moisturizing on my skin.  I did not like the scent it smelled kind of like plastic but it's not enough to put me off.  I will continue to use this and would buy again.,4
I have tons of makeup...and haven't been able to find a case big enough to hold it all.....until now.....everything all together and organized....,5
"I have recieved numerous compliments on this color, I would discribe it as being Navy blue with a tint of purple in the light and dark turquoise.",5
"I tried this and theDove Men Plus Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 13.5 Ounceand I can say that I just don't get this one. It's just a normal, bland soap feeling thing. Nothing special. I didn't have any reactions to it, but I just don't see the sense in using it. I prefer the other Dove product instead and would pass on this.",2
"I have used this cleansing system for 3 times in bathroom. After I used,I cleaned body of the machine with no hesitation,because it is so-called water-resistant in the introduction. However,when I removed the batteries and checked out,I found that the batteries were moist&#65292;there is no doubt that the water had gone into the machine.Secondly,the cleansing brush is very smooth,but sometimes it's too smooth to clean my skin. For personal reasons,my skin is very thin,after I used,my face is always red and dry. Maybe the cleansing system is not suitable for me.",3
The fact that it comes with a little dropper makes having this worth while. I bought it for the purpose of my seche vite but other than that I would probably stick to the bigger bottles of thinner for less than the price of this.,4
I went to ULTA looking for the new dark version. They didn't have it or the flawless so I got this. I have ordered to Golden Goddess and will try that as well. I applied this and waited and waited. Egh. I reapplied as I hardly noticed any color. Not sure. Its okay. I little color. Certainly not the &#34;I live at the beach tan I wanted&#34; Just a light glow. Not impressed. I will update after I try the Goddess. I don't think Its worth the money so far.,3
Want your face to glow? Try this. Its cheaper than the major competitors brand and delivers wonderful performance. Just understand this unit is a bit different than some.. you have to move it around to get the &#34;scrub&#34; effect if you want that but its simple and very very easy. It definitely outshines the cheaper versions that do rotate. I have seen a serious improvement in my skin.,5
"I was looking for an all-natural/organic line of make-up, specifically a foundation. This is not a product for women of color. The mocha tone is not deep dark enough, and leaves a white undertone. The product is smooth but the line is not catered to women of color.",1
"I've been looking for an effective & affordable BB cream for awhile now. I don't like wearing full-coverage foundation every day because it's overkill for a stay-at-home mom. But vanity being what it is, I prefer to put a little makeup on so I can be ready to run out door at any moment. I don't need to look like I'm going clubbing - just presentable.My requirements were all met: light to medium coverage, easy to blend, SPF, an agreeable scent, complimentary to my skin tone, and unlikely to make me break out.The one thing I don't adore about this cream is that my face looks a little shiny. But I usually use a little mineral powder to set it anyways and that solves it.The fact that I can now order all of my makeup from Amazon just seals the deal. Hooray!",4
"I really like this as a gentle skin toner. It seems to remove excess residue that washing my face leaves behind, and doesn't dry my skin out. Seems to have decreased my breakouts too.",5
"This concealer palette is awesome! I love that it has many different shades! For me, in the summer I get super dark and so I hate buying an extra concealer for that shade! It's all right here!",5
"this cleanser is gentle, has a nice fragrance and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. I order this one faithfully",5
This is still one of my favorite lotions.  The scent is still the same as it was years ago.  The scent is light and not too heavy.  I love smoothing it on before bed.,5
"I used this once for church...  As I never curl my hair, so it took some people a long time to recognize me. haha.It does look very nice and I got a lot of complements, so it works very well.  It gives you the nice curls without the heat damage.  I should use this more often!It was easy to use as I got it in nice and tight on the first try. Taking it out was a breeze too.  Sleeping in it was not very comfortable, but isn't there always a price to pay to look good?",5
"This is a good mask. It has the addition of the Dead Sea salts, which are good for helping to get rid of acne. Or it can be used for fine lines and wrinkles. This mask kind of does it all. Dead Sea salts are good for the skin in general, they pull toxins out of the skin.",4
"John Frieda indeed is a source for good quality haircare products. However, I did not notice any effect on my hair colour when I used this product.",3
"Pure and wonderful ,I use my sponge and rub it against the soap for extra mousse and the skin feel fresh and clean",5
"I have this product on hand now - discovered and purchased about three months ago - and a little goes a long way.  I use ORS Pudding mostly as a styling gel and it's also a moisturizer that works very well for dry, brittle hair because it makes the hair easier to comb and style plus has a &#34;setting&#34; effect as well that keeps the hair in place. One thing though - this is a product that works best on un-relaxed or &#34;natural&#34; hair and tends to make the hair look somewhat &#34;curly&#34; - so I wouldn't use as a moisturizer on relaxed or straightened hair unless the hair is blow-dried after using. Also, this product has a build-up effect in the hair but it works well for me because I wash my hair once a week and because of the way I usually style my hair - brushed and pulled back in a bun alot (too much).  Overall this is a great solution for dry, hard-to-manage natural hair that makes the hair soft and healthy-looking - plus easier to brush and style. I don't have kids but if I did I'd definitely use this product on my children's hair as well because of it's primary organic ingredients.",5
"I use this eyeliner brush with eyeshadows to line my top lashline and use the pushing method. This brush could be a lot better. It does have stiff bristles, which is needed for the pushing method of lining but the bristles are rough and hurt my eyes. I also tend to get fallout when using this brush so I don't find myself reaching for it much at all.",2
"After using another brand for a while I was contacted by Protege to try their C-Rum. I find that my skin is smoother, calmer, tighter since switching to this product. I use it around my eyes as well as over my entire face, neck and chest. I also use their eye cream and both work really well together. 4 stars because I'm only 3 weeks in to using it... who knows what else I'll love about it. Exfoliate before using it for an amazing tingle and refreshing scent. Can be drying in already prone areas so use a time or two to determine if you should use less C-Rum and more moisturizer.Love the citrus scent, to me it smells like grapefruit which I enjoy very much. I'm going through an adjustment period with this because I have combination skin so where I have oily skin is smoother than it's been since I was a teen but where I tend to be dry it's still a balancing act. I am trying different ways to effectively use the C-Rum in these areas. I believe I will find that applying to these areas only once daily will be the answer since it already seems to be having the right result.I am 43, Caucasian, no fine lines or wrinkles but some slight creping under my eyes and I have medium-fair skin. I tend to breakout hormonally but do not have acne as a norm. Combo skin with &#34;T&#34; zone oily skin with dryness at the jaw line, I do tend to breakout in my dry areas when they get too dry.",4
"Cheeky has the most variety in images. I Love my sets. This set does come with a protective backing so there is no Sharp edges. The full nail images will even cover your thumbs :) I have used most of these images already and have had ""no ""issues the transferring. The plates are slightly larger than the other set but its accommodating the image sizes and avoiding plate crowding. Any who doubt the quality should check Cheeky's FB page and see how others too enjoy this set with no issues. :)[...]  Short or long nails these plates do the job.",5
I have been looking for a nice light color when i am in the mood for a nude polish. I have finally found it ! very happy with this purchase.,4
"My husband got this for me as a Christmas gift and it works wonderfully. There is no question about authenticity, because this the genuine article for a great price. I use this for facial cleanser, hand soap, and shampoo.",5
"Ok, so I know the complaints about how the amazon shampoo is fake, but that's not why I'm writing this review. I bought the real one. I honestly have no idea what the big hype is over these products. I decided to buy them both just because they're sulfate & paraben free. I really loved finding these products. But it was a complete disappointment. I believe these products are only for people with extremely thick hair. My hair is very fine. This shampoo is totally drying and not moisturizing whatsoever. It completely weighed down my hair. Macadamia products give you no volume at all. It's for people who want flatter hair. I guess there are more thick-haired people than fine haired people. But these products are totally NOT for people with fine hair. You'll lose all your natural volume. This shampoo does not make my hair soft or smooth. It makes it tangly & a mess. I even got their leave-in cream, did not help at all. It took away no frizz. If you want shiny hair go honestly you should go to natural products like almond oil & argan oil to give it natural shine. Don't waste your money on this crap. I also have their deep hair repair mask & I liked that, for the smell mainly. But it still left my hair lifeless with no volume. I've been trying these products for at least a month & it made me completely disappointed. NEVER believe the hype. I went back to my Suave coconut shampoo & Alberto Tea therapy clarifying shampoo. It COMPLETELY surprised me. All the frizz is gone, my beautiful volume is back & everything. Honestly I tried very hard to love these products, but if I had to admit, I would tell you I COMPLETELY regretted wasting my money on this hype. Nothing special about it at all, sadly, & I was so excited telling everyone about it. Until I tried it.",1
I waited for them for so long and honestly dint recieve  300 piece is more like 50 but otherthan that i like them.you get wt you payfor :(,2
"I've finally found my staple moisturizer! I used to have mid-back length relaxed hair, but I've been natural for several months and have been looking for an all-natural moisturizer that works well with my hair. The moisturizers I've tried so far either don't completely absorb into my hair (describes some of Shea Moisture's other moisturizers), don't keep my hair moisturized, or require me to use too much and are expensive for the size of the bottle. Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Conditioning Milk is not one of these moisturizers! It absorbs right into my hair without leaving a residue on the surface, keeps it moisturized, and makes it EXTREMELY soft! I've never used a moisturizer that makes my hair feel so amazing! The smell is also incredible. It has nice, light coconuty smell that doesn't fade, which I love. It's light and creamy - definitely lighter than some of Shea Moisture's other moisturizers - yet despite it being light, I only need to use a relatively moderate amount to moisturize my hair. It's also great to know that all the ingredients are completely natural and that the price is so affordable* (see note below) for the quality and amount received. As I said in the review title, I have absolutely no idea what I'll do if they ever stop making this. I can finally stop wasting tons of money trying out countless different moisturizers and leave-ins because I've found a single product that does everything I need it to do.*Note: Please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than $9.99! I'm baffled that they're being sold for so much more than this (more than three times the normal price)! I love this moisturizer, but over $30 for an 8 ounce bottle that normally retails for under $10? Are these sellers out of their minds? This moisturizer and all other Shea Moisture hair products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer's price. You can find them at Walgreens and Target for $9.99.Ingredients: Deionized Water , Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) , Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut) , Sugar Starch , Silk Protein , Essential Oil Blend , Melia Azadirachta Seed Oil (Neem) , Caprylyl Glycol , Sorbitol Esters , Algae Extract , Hlyssopus Officinalis Extract , Salvia Officinalis Leaf and Equisetum Arvense Extract (Sage) , Daucus Carota Sativa Seed Oil (Carrot) , Lonicera Caprifolium Flower Lonicera Japonica Flower Extract (Honeysuckle and Japanese Honeysuckle) , Tocopherol (Vitamin E)",5
"The lotion smells nice (light fruity smell) but doesn't linger too long, and is not greasy. It's a good summer lotion but is probably not heavy enough for winter. Best of all it contains lactic acid at the correct pH. I pH tested it - 3.5, which is the pH needed for the lactic acid to be effective.",5
"I use the Clear shampoo and conditioner and really jumped at the chance to try these.I have long, highlighted hair that is thick and straight.  I often have trouble getting a comb through it and it's very heavy.I tried this product and followed directions and my hair was very soft, manageable and easy to comb.I have very thick hair and I really didn't think one tube would be enought but it really was. The scent is very nice, and the treatment just spreads through your hair.After you rinse it out, your hair is softer and feels healthier.When I'm done with this sample, I will go to the store to buy these.You may not use them every day but maybe once a week if you blow dry or curl your hair or damage it any way.very nice product and I really like this product line.",5
"The customer support is great and product ships out fast. I did see some improvement and it did seem to work. However, it was just a little to high in price for me to do another order. I can only give a one month trial rating.",3
Kind of junky quality. However they make a clean cut  and do not crack the nail. Overall a good deal for the price.,4
"Can't live without it! Makes my face sooooo smoth and clean,  my husband loves it too I had to get him some for him.",5
I am very pale with cool undertones and this (powder blush in Taupe) is the first product I've ever been able to use for contouring without looking like I had a bronzer accident. The shade is cool enough to just look like a shadow and it is buildable. In the past I have been unhappy with NYX powder blushes because the staying power just isn't there but the taupe shade seems to wear most of the day on my oily skin.,5
"Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 protects your skin quite well.  Is also contains moisturizer to keep your skin soft and smooth.As a bonus, it doesn't have that typical sunscreen aroma - perhaps a bit of aloe smell, but very subtle and unobtrusive.  So I feel OK wearing this at the beach or around the house when I have to spend a some time in the sun.  This product seems like a winner to me.",5
"In the tube the Siren shade looks very orange, but once applied it is more of a nice orange-ish coral. It's very flattering for pale skin.",5
"It smells good. Most noticeable is the smell of grapefruit. I'm not sensitive to smell so for some the smell might be too strong. It makes a good lather. It seems like it would make a good summer body wash.Because it&#8217;s a gel it&#8217;s probably too drying for long term winter use, but I&#8217;ve had no issues with dry skin because of it as yet.",4
I've just been experimenting anyway and I guess I misunderstood just what this product was capable of.  I was expecting actual coloring and got very little change at all.,2
"This is a great curling iron. It heats up fast and has a good size barrel so it is easy to use, especially if you have long hair.",5
"I really love this product and have used it for years. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and this was recommended to me by my optometrist.",5
"Beautiful,a must have a so classy I love them they don't tarnish they stay shiny looks life stones but it's not a must have wish you got more in the pack but I will order again!",5
use with nu face and does not irritate like some other brands. My mom swears by this stuff to tighten her face,5
"Pretty clip!  Ordered 2, 1 for a friend.  I'm pleased with the items, attractive and stylish.  Recommended for sure!  thanks",5
For men's products whether it be deodorant or whatever but my daughter recommended this stuff because I live up in the mountains and my face is always drying out and I have fairly sensitive skin for a macho guy (hey a little self confidence building never hurt!).  I have to admit that I had my doubts but it lived up to the hype and washing morning and night keeps my face pretty well hydrated during the day.  It cleans pretty good and is easy to use but the hydration is the real kicker and I'm glad I found the product.  I'll be using it from here on out.,5
"Just got this is the mail to try. I was very happy with the way it came packaging with bubble wrap and that each product was wrap tight and secure. I love when companies think about shipping their products out and taking the time to secure their products, I used it as soon as I opened it, Love it so far, but Of course I will need more time to actually see how it works long term use!!But so far I love it and recommend this company for they're packaging and their product ***** 5 Stars",5
"I am a long time wearer of bare escentuals mineral powder, I wanted a more even look, and have never worn liquid foundation. After trying this, I am hooked. I always read all reviews on all products and went back and forth on a few, this one won. And I am super happy with it. My face looks even, and it leaves a bit of a dewy look which is youthful and natural looking.",5
"The Awapuhi and Ginger Suave products smell great, so I knew that I would like that aspect of this conditioner.  It is a pretty standard creamy conditioner otherwise.  Since it is on the heavy side, I used it with a clear shampoo to avoid limp or greasy hair.  Overall, a very nice option to have in the rotation.",4
I am in love with this color because not only is it a soft lilac it has undertones of blue so the color stands out! beautiful,5
"This is one of my favorite mascaras. I will continuously try out different mascaras, but always end up coming back to this one. I will sometimes layer this with the L'Oreal False Lashes in the gold bottle (I can't remember the name of the mascara) and the two work wonderfully together. I like this better over the Dior mascaras and Benefit, too.",4
"InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is almost clear and has a sweet smell with a hint of citrus and just the slightest whiff of spice. The new, improved formula has a slightly more viscous consistency, which makes it easier to apply to the skin. It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.Inside the bottle is blend of helpful ingredients such as aloe, vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) 20%, vitamin E (tocopherol), MSM, hyaluronic acid, sodium PCA, and jojoba oil, in an herbal infusion. The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells. It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin. I have also found that regular application seems to minimize the appearance of facial pores.There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months. Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.It is best applied after a bath or shower. The solution is slightly thick but is not at all oily and just a few drops massaged into the skin immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated. Apply a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin. Storing it in the refrigerator makes it feel even more refreshing and also keeps it safe from light and heat.InstaNatural provided vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.",5
"Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner, 8 OunceI'm just an outdoor kind of girl (nature, wildlife, tornado photographer, hiker, salsa gardener et al), and my hair and hair color can take a real beating from the Sun, heat, cold, wind etc.reads Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner*Intensive Deep Nourishment, Keeps Color Vibrant for up to 8 WeeksOkay, I'll try it *into my Shopping Cart it goes*1st I shampooed withDove Hair Shampoo, Color Care.Rinsed shampoo out and next applied a minute amount of Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner.Daily Treatment Conditioner has a pineapple/coconut sort of scent, is super thick and creamy, applies evenly -- with little effort -- through hair. I used a small amount, and that was plenty for my waist-length hair. Waited a minute (as per the instructions) and rinsed out with clean water. Conditioner rinsed out easily and left no tacky feeling on hair.  Combed out hair with wide-toothed comb, blow dried and then styled as usual.Hair is beautiful, feels extraordinarily silky, feels a lot thicker, has a noticeable healthy shine (but the brassiness, of my blonde hair has been toned down -- better for photographs).Perfect! :)Just knowing that I've taken the time to add a bit more protection to one of my best assets (my hair) is totally worth the tiny bit of time it took to do it. *smiles*Does Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013note:  Other Dove Color Care Products I've reviewed:Dove Hair Shampoo, Color CareDove Hair Therapy Conditioner, Color CareDove Hair Shampoo, Color CareDove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner",5
I have combination skin and this cleanser leaves me balanced and feeling clean. The scrublet is great not cheap at all and easy to handle. It exfoliates very well and all of my dead skin is removed; I have not felt dry flakes since using this.  The pores on my nose have also shrank and much less noticeable.Although this has salycylic acid I feel like it could use a bit more. It appears to keep my pimples at bay and I have not had a huge breakout but it does not work very well to eliminate my larger bumps.I woukd recommend this cleanser but be sure to spot treat if you get bumps.,4
My husband has sensitive skin and this is a great antiperspirant for him. It's gentle on the skin and yet powerful enough to do the job. It is moisturizing and seems to hold true to the wetness protection factor.,5
"My nails have been a mess for a long time. I have no idea why. They chip, split, peel.I've used everything on them but nothing has helped.  This stuff helps.  You reallyhave to use it every single day without fail.  It takes a couple of weeks for the resultsto show up. Then, if you stop for a while, the nails go right back to being a mess.It's the only product I've found that works at all.  If you're willing to use it faithfully,it will probably work for you.",4
"I like a spicy, woodsy scent and this is a good one.  It's not sweet or flowery. Its also not heavy which I like also.  Glad I got it!",4
"I really like this product.  It makes my hair apear fuller and thicker.  It also seems to help prolong the life of my hairstyle.  I usually have to wash my hair every day since it gets oily fast.  This product seems to help control the oil on my scalp and I can skip a shampoo without it looking grose.I apply it after styling my hair but before back-combing (teasing) and hair spray.It can get a little messy when applying but not too bad.  I also haven't had a problem with it coming off on my pillow.My biggest complaint with this product is the way it looks up-close on my scalp.  If you look closely at my scalp after applying it, it looks kinda weird.  Not terrible but just kinda weird and slightly blotchy looking. Luckily no one is all up super close to my head looking at it, at least I hope not.  :)Also if you scratch your head where the powder is, it will come off on your finger and leave a ""naked"" spot where you touched - kinda making it more obvious that you have colored powder in your hair.But complaints aside it does help a gal with her thinning flat hair.",4
"This is one of my favorite hair serums. It is not at all greasy, a little goes a long way (half pump to 1 full pump for long hair), and it helps fight frizziness. It doesn't necessarily help with holding a style, but won't make hair heavy and cause styled hair to fall flat. When I had natural colored hair, it worked great at making it sleek and soft. However, after bleaching my hair, I noticed that my hair tangles more easily, which isn't helped by this serum, and other products now work better to soften my hair (although they also make it a little oilier). I continue to use this and deal with tangles in order to avoid greasy products, but if your hair is really damaged, you might try another product that helps with damage more. Otherwise, for non-bleached hair, this product is a five star.",4
Great color. Frosted lipstick looks good with a slight tan. Very summery. Stays on lips. Used this brand for 30 years.,5
"This fragance is divine, hard lo describe....I have a few favorites,among others Juicy Couture by JC, Reaction by K. Cole and Selena Gomez fragance( a winner too!) but I have to set this one aside as the heavenly one, nothing to envy to Christian Dior or Prada ( I love those, my all time faves are Addict, Dune, the Poisons and Eau d' Iris!) Like I said I fell in love again with Jimmy Choo...mmmmmm I even snif myself non stop when I wear it.",5
the line is not very black and you have to reapply it over and over to get an opaque line,3
"I really like this product, this foaming wash is gently yet gets the job done. I certainly like it more than there regular head to toe body wash. I notice some take issue with how natural it ""really"" is it has been great for us I have used this on myself as well as my baby girl, I highly recommend this item.",5
I ordered this after seeing Pins about how great it was. I normally hate how drastic most lipsticks look and lip tints are dry and need layers. The &#34;almost lipstick&#34; solves both of those problems by adding subtle color and feeling like a chapstick. It looks really dark in the tube but doesn't look too dark on your lips. I think this is a shade that would look good on anyone. AND it is actually cheaper on Amazon than the actual website.,5
I was perfectly happy with this purchase & good price!  I have used this exact product for years .. the ONLY curling iron that  heats up fast & hot enough to do the job for me .. plus has a nice long life  On and on and on!  Once I found this brand I have never switched .. have used it for years .. have it in just about every size for all the different hair styles I've had over the years! You won't be disappointed .. IF you are comfortable with a Marcel curling iron.  Great Product!,5
"I love this stuff! It is thick and creamy, dries fairly quick and it definitely long lasting on moisture. The cocoa scent isn't at all over powering, it's light and sticks with you. Great lotion for the winter months and I will definitely be a returning customer!",5
"I have used this before.  It was nice to find that Amazon sold it for less than my usual place.  Anyways, I use it about three times a week, and my sun spot is not gone.  However it is noticably lighter.",5
"I was skeptical on purchasing this because it's a small amount for $10, but I decided on it anyway. When it arrived, I was eager to try it, and even said I wasn't going to wear makeup until it got here. When I put it on I didn't really think much was going to change, until 6 hours later I checked the mirror and everything was still in place! I was so impressed with it. Even my crease makeup was staying instead of running into my base. I compared it by not using this the next day and 3 hours later my eye shadow looked awful.The primer is pretty much amazing. Now I can wear eye shadow and not be self-conscious about my eyes if I'm going out for a few hours. :)",5
its very black and gives your lashes great length volume and curl. it does give your eyes a more doll like appearance.,5
"This is the product, leave hair straight, soft and with an incredible shine. I have very fine hair so I use it with my titanium flat Iron at 390 degrees Fahrenheit, but It can be use it up to 450 degrees. I don't recommend using it every time you wash the hair, because it have to be sealed with high heat and you can damage your hair  if you use it always, personally I used once a month or every two weeks, when I want my hair to specially straight and shinny.",5
"I'm the kind of person who usually ignores my hair and tries to get away with the best look for the least amount of work, and this has been perfect for me.  Due to having short hair, blowdry-and-style is my go-to, and this has made such an approach much easier.  A little keeps fly-aways at bay, and more packs such a hold that the blowdry with appropriate brushing is pretty much all I need--even a little hairspray for hold seems to be superfluous.  I am very impressed with this product.",5
"I expected them to be a bit longer. Other than that though, They're very cute, I got lots of good ones and I use them all the time c: would recommend for nail art fans",3
"The title says it all!  Lots of lavish bubbles, long lasting too!  I just wish that it had more of a lavender scent, but for the price I am not complaining.  I also appreciated the fact that the ingredient list was short, it didn't have a bunch of chemicals in it!",5
"Only been using for a couple weeks now, but the color is true to picture and it lasts all day!",5
"My wife ordered it and since I just pretty much use the first thing I can find, I tried it as well.  My wife and I like it because it does make our skin feel smooth and it does clean our skin very well without drying it.  We recommend it.",5
I really liked the curling iron. With its non tangling cord to the 30 heat settings. i like that its one inch . It gives me the tight curls that I need . If you have long hair or short. (like mine is short).  It gives the purfect curl. I used the heat setting on 20. I used some oil and hair spray and it gave me a long lasting curl. Great curling iron.,5
"My hair is naturally dark brown. A year ago, I dyed it blonde, then red. Since then I've been trying to get my hair back to its original color, so before using this product, it was already pretty brown. I wanted the red tones to be less apparent, so I used coffee instead of water as the instructions say to do. I left it in for one hour. It didn't do much for the red tones. My hair is now slightly darker (and smells like dirt). I like that it's all natural and seemed to condition my hair but the messy, smelly, and long process hardly seems worth it in my case. I think it did the job it was meant to do and I simply expected it to have an effect it wasn't marketed to have.",4
"I have not tried the original I guess, but my friend loves this one, she was very happy with the smell, plus I liked it on her too, as long as she is happy then I know the product was worth it, plus it comes in a nice bottle..",5
Amazing neon pink that stands out and screams &#34;look how awesome i am!&#34; Perfect neon with the amazing Essie quality,5
Amazing coverage and staying power even in tropical climates but I find it hard to blend well.  I prefer the one for oily skin even though I dont think my skin is oily.  I found that I need to blend the nude with the buff to get the right colour for my skin.,4
"I am always trying new lotions for my face and neck (I had 35 days of radiation to my left side from my cheek bone to just under my clavicle) trying to find something that is really going to moisturize my skin, protect me from the sun (I no longer had any natural protection on the left side), and not irritate my skin or feel oilly. So when I saw the Dove Revitalize I snagged it, but then saw the Dove Hydrate and got that, too. You have to understand, my skin on the left side is soft, but will always need to be moisturized and protected from the sun, so I need something I can use every day, hopefully for what will be a very long life.Dove Hydrate works as advertised. It does not go on greasy, and feels rich and thick when being applied. Fragrance is sometimes a problem for me, but not this time. I had no irritations on my skin at all. It really feels nice against my skin and feels like it is doing a good job. Since I need year-round protection, I don't want something that is going to make me breakout and Hydrate seems like a great solution. While it may be a little more expensive than some of the ""cheap"" lotions, I think it is worth it....and, it is much cheaper than a lot of the specialty lotions, like Arbonne, etc. I do wish it came with a stronger SPF, especially for after the winter, when I will be outside much more....maybe I can find this in a travel size and keep it with me in  my car or in my personal travelling storage compartment (aka my wifes purse).As for the fragrance of still smelling like a man, I don't really get that. I never really smelled any poduct that was marketed for men that smelled overly feminine, and my wife has never told me I smell like her, nor have my friends ever told me I smell like their wife/girlfriend. Also, after wearing this, nobody has mentioned that I now smell more like a man....but I guess it's nice to know that Dove is concerned that people might pass by me and say, ""What an ugly woman,"" but thanks to their fragrance, I guess that shouldn't happen. LOL.Back to being serious. I should also note that during my radiation, my radiation oncologist said to use fragrance free Dove soap, which I used. My skin burned VERY severely, they told me they never saw anyone burn as much as I had. I do not attribute this to the soap, I just mention it, because I never got any kind of skin infection (of course I also ended up having to use some heavy duty burn cream which was pretty amazing). I mention this to give you an idea of the quality of my skin, and the severity of the burn.....if Hydrate feels good on me, it should be great for you! :)",5
"This is a good moisturizer for dry to combination skin. I have dry and extremely spots to somewhat oily surfaces and was able to try it out on my skin over a period of a week to write this review.The skin feels supple and more moist within two uses. It plumps up the skin to the point that it feels softer and looks softer and smoother as well.I am really light skinned and didn't get sunburned while wearing this moisturizer but the jury's out as to whether this is because of the reported SPF 15 in this moisturizer or because the UVA and the UVB light isn't strong enough yet (it's almost the end of May but the sun has been an elusive creature this year).The ingredients are relatively safe. They sound safer than the generic brands at the Dollar Store but not as good as some of the organic products you'll find as Whole Foods. In other words, if you wouldn't eat it, why put it on your skin (where the absorbency is upwards of 85%).The heath issue aside, the only true negative observation about this product is that one quickly develops a dependency to it. It's not quite a heavy dependency, but what I noticed is that after using it for about three days straight, I didn't want to quit using it since my ski felt much more supple when I used the product.To prove to myself that, although I liked the feeling of supple, smooth skin, I needed to let go of using it to see the teue results. What transpired next is not a mystery - my skin went back to being drier and less ""enriched"" with adequate nourishment.Overall, I think this is a decent product but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to purchase it.",4
"This is one of my all time favorite shades.  It's like a purplish/brownish color that looks add but is beautiful for fall and winter.  It is a bit dark but I love that, it a sophisticated color age appropriate for anyone.  The formula is great, requiring two coats to obtain full opacity but well worth it.  I have very pale skin and I love how it looks.  I suppose if you have darker skin it'll look somewhat neutral but beautiful none the less.",5
I wanted a shampoo without too many harsh chemicals... that also smelled good. This smells amazing! I use it withAphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor 16ozand100% Pure Emu Oil (8 oz.)afterwards. My hair is stronger and smells good.There are so many other products that build strong hair that smell horrible. I've had enough of them.,5
"I love that this doubles as both a regular razor and a bikini trimmer. I've been using Bic Soleil razors for a long time, and I love this new product. Easy to use and gets the job done!",4
"I read reviews, but no one seemed to mention fragrance, so I took a chance.  I was actually looking for something I'd had before .. a lovely almond-scented almond oil that I used to use. . . but I can't remember the manufacturer's name!However, unfortunately for me, this oil has no fragrance. .. .Then I stopped and thought. . hmm. maybe that's not a bad thing. .I can use it when I'm using perfume elsewhere, so there's no clash.  It does seem to rub into the skin nicely and doesn't leave a greasy after-film. ..  The weather here isn't dry enough for me to judge its effectiveness .. but I like it ok so far. .. I gave it two stars for not having fragrance. . and for not SAYING so in its description.But it's great for people who want it unscented.",2
I've been using this product for about 5 days. I'm not impressed. I thought I was going to love it but I don't. Revlon eyeshadow primer is better than this. With the NYX eyeshadow primer my eyelids are oilier.,2
"I have been using this shampoo for about a month now, and I LOVE it!!! My hair is soft and shiny without any weighty, gloppy feel. I wash my hair every other day, and with most hair care products, my hair feels limp and flat on day two, but I see a significant difference in how full and bouncy my hair looks and feels on day two. It may seem like a pricey product, but this shampoo, like all Fekkai hair care products, a lil' dab will do ya - really - you only need dollop about the size of a quarter. I've also noticed the color of my hair is not nearly as drab and washed out looking (it's going white). Phenomenal product! I'll definitely be sticking with this one!",5
"I had used this product in the past, and had some really good results.  I have some fragile edges, and after wearing my hair in braids, needed to regrow my temples out.  So far, I am seeing results.  It's not going to grow them out overnight, but it is helping.  It isn't heavy and the smell is pleasant.",4
"The brushes aide me in accomplishing what I need to do, which apply makeup. I have only used two or three because I had older brushes that I still use. I am excited that there are so many for the price. I don't even know what to do with all these brushes. I will say that the bag does have a strange odor that when you are around it for an extended period of time, it will become overwhelming.  I had it sitting on the table next to me while I was using my computer and the odor began to make me sneeze and become congested.  I ended up removing the brushes and storing them in pencil holders I'd bought for them anyway, and just put the bag in an inconspicuous area in hopes it will air out and the smell will dissipate.",4
"A sulfate free hair conditioner that doesn't cost a ton.  It leaves the hair smelling and feeling soft, silky, smooth, and terrific.  I wasn't sold on the product at first, but after a few uses I love the way it makes my hair feel.",5
"The Clean & Clear Blackhead eraser kit comes with this nifty vibrating wand and a bunch of little lavender abrasive pads that have a cleaning solution already in them. You just pop the Velcro like pad onto the small hand held wand while your in the shower, run the cleansing pad under the water and then buff your face clean by running the wand over your face, paying special attention to the t-zone or any other area you may have trouble with.It kinda felt like a mini sander lightly stripping away the dead skin and dirt. The vibration is a little heavy, especially going over your cheek bones, buy no more so than the Dove wand I have and I didn't like its results nearly as much as the Clean & Clear. My skin feels clean, smooth, and polished after using just one of these little pads and after using it for two weeks my pores look noticeably smaller. Does a better job than face scrub. I like the convenience of being able to use it in the shower as well. All in all, I'm very pleased.",4
I was dissapointed when I opened this and saw that I really couldnt see any holo in the inside light... even under a bright lamp it was VERY fant. If you are lookin for really good holos try the color club halo hues... China glaze is my favorite nail polish company but this just wasnt impressive for a holo. It is a very beautiful color though.,3
"Have been using this weekly for the past month on my daughter who suffers from back acne with sevre scaring. On first application she felt no stinging and did not peel (left it on for 7 minutes).  Did a follow-up days later and while I noticed some frosting on her back - she still has not peeled and she started breaking out more. Sheesh!While it's working for some...definitely did not work for us. I received the instructions and followed them to the tee (cleaned her back, wiped down with alcohol, applied the peel, rinsed with cold water and applied a liquid skin neutralizer, moisturizer and sun screen). Absolutely nothing! Very disappointed...",2
"I usually like Clearasil products and this one matches up with my expectations. It comes out smooth, lathers well and leaves my face clean.  It has a clean scent, but not overpowering or chemically. I do have sensitive skin, so I only use this every other day, as it is a bit drying.  I follow this with some moisturizer and my face is clean, smooth, and blemish free. Overall, I like it a lot and use it regularly.",4
"This has micro, holo glitters in a clear base.  It looks beautiful over any color!  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn't have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!",5
"Middle aged on a mission seems to take it's toll on my skin, but I can sleep better knowing I put this on after cleansing my face at night right before bed. This is a lovely, essentially fragrance free NATURAL product that absorbs nicely into the skin. It is a little heavy for my daytime use (I use Jason Tea Time Moisturizer then), but is a perfect night cream and that is precisely what I was looking for. The whole line is affordable, gentle and effective, plus their whipped cream style cleanser ROCKS!",5
I will never use another eyelash curler again!!! This is a fantastic product that can be used with or without mascara already on & it works in seconds. Doesn't burn your eye even when you get super close & the results last forever-or at least for me they were still pretty curled the next day!,5
"I have found a miracle product. After 24 hours of applying this cream twice a day, my eyelids have returned back to normal. My eyelids very dry, flaky, red, and inflamed-nothing I have ever experienced before. It may have been a makeup allergy or the cold dry weather, but nonetheless I looked ""jacked up"" as my guy friend said and I was desperate for a cure. Luckily, I came upon this amazing product online and after reading excellent reviews, I hurried to the closest Nordstrom and bought one. I am so glad to have come upon this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone with dry and inflamed skin problems.On a further note, I gave this to my mom to try on her flaky, itchy, and dry elbows. She has been experiencing this problem for twenty years and have never found a cure. After two days, she found the results to be favorable. She stopped itching and her elbows were looking better. She loved it so much she wouldn't give it back to me! So I had to buy another one. But yes, it is a great product and a definite must try when your skin is encountering problems.",5
"Covergirl has made a very natural looking, average mascara with this new Natureluxe Mousse Mascara. I have tried many different mascaras since the 60's and this one is nothing new to me. Covergirl has blended synthetic polymers with beeswax and this has made a very waxy, thin mascara that doesn't do a whole lot to make nice thick lashes. The mascara is waxy thin and takes a while to build up on your lashes with the tiny comb. Due to the thin wax, you don't get clumps and it also removes easily. This mascara is for someone who wants to look very natural with just a thin coat on your lashes. I personally like my lashes longer and coated more, as I like a heavier look with my eyeliner. I will just stick to my old dependable Revlon mascara which always gives me long, black lashes.",3
"Haven't used it just got it today. Cannot believe how fast I got it! They packed it securely, The powder comes with an extra seal plus packed in a zip lock bag . All canisters where filled to the top and the brush is a little small but very cute and I love that you can use the handle part of the brush as a cap, so after use, you can just snap the metal part of the handle off and store the brush inside of it. I wish the acrylic liquid bottle was bigger  its only 4oz but  so far it seems like a great product at a great price and great speedy service. I do a lot of nail sculpting and 3d nail art, so Im hoping its easy to work with. I will give it 5 stars when I test it out tomorrow.",4
"I have had a few different flat irons - Revlon, Chi, Gold n Hot.  Never really satisfied with the outcome, straightness or shine. The straight look never lasted.With this one, my hair is moving, shiny shiny shiny, and straight.  It looks soft and touchable. I used 320 degrees, and my hair is awesome. Straight and silky in one pass.  I am on day 3, and my hair is awesome, if I say so myself. I used a little grapeseed oil to protect it, and then the iron.  AWESOME. Get it. I am so serious.",5
"You cannot find these in any beauty supply store! They are beautful and I plan on ordering more. The wear well and wash well! They are synthetic so you can't apply heat to them but if you like a traight style, these are perfect.",5
"They're a little too firm for my liking, and a big downside is that once they get dirty, it just gets stained. You can tell where you have put makeup on it even though you wash it. Also, even after getting it damp it seriously takes up a lot of makeup. After trying these out and trying out brushes,  I think I'll just stick to applying with my hand!",3
"With all these white floral notes listed, I would normally be turned off ... but not with Bora Bora. After hours of research online, I finally decided to give this one a try for summer, and without a sniff ... I bought it. I am so glad that I did.Don't let the tropical island theme fool ya -- it's neither a fruit salad nor a pina colada, and it's not watery or island-like either. Many reviewers highlight the tropical flower notes -- I get those, but on paper. On me, it wears differently.Definitely florals & fruits, very well blended & difficult to pick out individual notes. Wears sweet. I can smell jasmine on top. There's a musk and/or amber. Perhaps bamboo & pineapple? On another website, notes listed are pink peppercorn, lychee, sand, mango, and musk. No single note dominates and nothing turns sickly, which is frequently a problem for me.Nice. Pleasant. Unique. Adult. Unknown. Exotic. Womanly.This is a mature fragrance, in that it is meant for a woman not a girl. It's got good lasting power, and a few sprays are lasting me a full day. However, it is a soft fragrance that stays close to the skin. Although I'll likely only wear it in summer, and occasionally as a pick-me-up in winter, this fragrance would be suitable year-round for many women.The opalescent glass bottle is beautiful & substantial ... but the plastic top is just plain tacky.At its current price, it's terrific value for a quality fragrance imho. In fact, I am so impressed with Bora Bora that I am sampling every LC release in the 2000s. Yup, Bora Bora is that good. Full bottle worth!.Rating: 5 out of 5.EDIT: Confirmed! Bora Bora is a famous designer smell-alike. I have penned 2 *unnamed*perfume* reviews with the observation, only to have them deleted. That said, the famous designer brand is smoother & rounder than BB, and it is muskier as it dries. Regardless, BB is a GREAT smell-alike at a great price. Search a bit online and you find the name mentioned.",5
I needed to upgrade my 5 brushes to one &#34;great&#34; one and this is it!!! It helps to detangle and style which is just what I needed. What a great price too!!!,5
This is one of my favorite scents from VS. Light enough to wear everyday and great for both a summer and winter scent.,5
Slimquick products may cause liver-failure...I bought the bottle and found this out and have not touched the pills since. Losing weight may seem like the most important or one of the most important goals of your life at the moment but it is absolutely not worth liver-failure.[...],1
"While I generally favor an SPF 45, most sunscreens will offer adequate sun protection if they are applied frequently. Sweating and exposure to water necessitate more frequent application during the dog days of summer. Nicely scented without a really obvious odor, this comes in a lotion formulation. I applied it evenly on exposed areas, sat in the sun for about an hour and then swam for about a half an hour. I reapplied and spent another hour outside.I thought this offered good protection. My skin felt hydrated after coming in and I did not experience any redness or burning. I also I'd not need to use a moisturizer .My only criticism is that with frequent application, this 6 oz. squeeze tube probably won't last very long so it isn't a particularly good value. Still it works well and has prevented any drying or redness.",4
"I bought this at a store in CA, Glendale Galleria while on vacation. At the time I was obsessed with Korean BB creams and the coverage you get from it. And this BB Cream delivers! I got this one specifically because this one is targeted for more oily skin and I get an oily T-Zone. It's got great coverage so you really need to match the skin tone well. I might have gotten too dark of a color but it's okay because I'll just use it during the summer when I'm a little more tanned. I still get a little oily a couple hours into wear, but I haven't found anything that will prevent that so I don't blame the BB Cream. I like it and I would buy it again if they opened up a store in NYC.",5
"I will admit that I am a great fan of Olay skin products.  The Regenerist line works extremely well for me, without causing my almost 60 year old skin to break out.  I am always looking for a good sun block product that will prevent sun damage, without having to apply it constantly.  I sweat a lot, which tends to negate the effects of most of the sunblock products that I have tried.Now this Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Dna Superstucture Uv Cream Spf 25, (wow, is that a name or what!) is my favorite so far.  The pump dispenser measures out just the right amount to apply to face and neck.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not notice a heavy scent.  I was aware of the product on my face, but it didn't bother me, since this has been my same experience with most other high price sunscreen products.  The first time I used it, was before spending the day outside working with friends.  After a few hours, I perspired heavily, and even after all that, I didn't sustain any sunburn.  Usually 10 minutes outdoors, and I am starting to turn red.I use many other products in the Regenerist line, so I can't say that this one provides any additional ""anti aging"" benefits in particular, but the sunblock feature is worth the price, in my opinion.",5
I really wanted to enjoy this scent. It did warm as I rubbed my wrists together. A little goes a long way and it does last all day. If I enjoyed the way it smelled it would be one of the best deals out there. I have smelled this smell on several old ladies before. I'm looking for a younger sultry scent. Does not smell like the description :(My best description would be old powder that back in the day women used to coat themselves in. It didn't smell good then & it doesn't smell good now. I just had my hubby take a wiff and he threw his head back and said eewww that smells like old lady. Sorry!,3
Just got it in the mail today! LOVE the color! Just what I was looking for and for a great price! Great buy!,5
"I'll have to admit that I used to travel for a living, which means that I used to use whatever shampoo was provided by the hotel, so I'm definitely NOT a shampoo connoisseur.  With that being said, my hair and scalp definitely know if there is an issue with the shampoo I'm using, generally using shampoos with conditioners in them, causing flakes.  After a week, this is definitely a decent shampoo.  Another comparable is CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY AntiDandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE).Either way, I like them both.",4
"I got the Kabuki Brush by Beauty Junkees for my wife to try out. Based on her feedback, she found it was different than what she was used to, but it was definitely a high-quality product.She's used to a brush with stiffer bristles, and the white tips of this brush were softer and offered more drag and coverage with the foundation she was using. Once she got used to that difference, she liked the effect and result. There was no bristle shedding, and the handle was comfortable and easy to hold.Overall, she thought the Kabuki brush was a very good brush and much cheaper than what she would expect to pay elsewhere.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free",5
"I've used this brush twice since I received it and the detachable head falls off onto the floor of the shower, making quite a racket that frightens my dog.  I'll see if it falls off again in the next week, and if so, I'll return it as ""defective.""",3
"This conditioner, especially when paired withNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo, 13.5 Ounce- that's how I used it, at least) creates clean, soft, light feeling hair.  Works for normal, fine hair..as well as very thick, fine hair...and even ""ethnic"" hair.  Smells fantastic, too!The most pronounced results were on the head containing very thick, fine hair - the hair had a level of lightness/bounce to it, smelled great, and felt very soft.  The ethnic hair ended up great, too - rather than feeling dry and coarse, it still felt like the hair was thick, but very soft and very smooth.  (And the normal, short, ""whatever"" fine hair...it worked well, but not as obviously superior than other brands.)Highly recommended.  Get that shampoo, too!",5
"According to Chaz Dean, in one of his informercials, he said that cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner was specially design for fine hair because it has aloe.I have been buying WEN for a while now , for that reason I have tried different ""scent"" conditioners.I bought this conditioner because I have fine hair. The aloe helps fine hair by adding volume so it doesn't lay flat. But I didn't notice any difference using this conditioner (normally you feel that kind of minty sensation on the scale or even the smell but no. No difference from this product to any of the other WEN conditioners.  Honestly I think is just the smell that changes.Dont get me wrong I like how my hair feels after using WEN, Im just saying that I don't feel that this product could be different or does any differences  on my hair than any other WEN conditioner.The smell is very settle, not the best one but not bad.",3
"Not thick enough if you ask me. This is more of a creamy consistency. I prefer a thicker, richer foot cream. I do use this for my hands and it's very nice for that.",3
"The Pantene Minoxidil Topical Solution Usp, 2% Hair Regrowth Treatment For.Women  came packaged with 3 bottles and one applicator. My beef with the applicator is that it is child-proof -- certainly that's a great idea but if you have arthritis and no kids in the household there should be a way to remove the top cap and just use the eyedropper with the bottom (inner) cap. I may have to saw off the top cap with my Swiss Army Knife saw.The instructions that come with the product are extensive, informative and very helpful. The product is easy to apply, I have a bald spot on the back (top) of my head and this liquid covers it without being too runny -- I can control the amount and the location using the eyedropper. The instructions say that it takes about 4 months to see results, and I am patient. Will report back again..UPDATE March 2014 -- Using it religiously. I also like to apply it on my baldies just before bed, It gets cold here and I wear a stocking cap on my noggin at nite. What I found to be effective is to draw just a little Rogaine into the eyedropper and then ""scribble"" it onto one bald spot and then the next, using a crosshatching pattern so it covers everything but does not drip.",4
"The scent is sweet, kind of vanilla-y and spice-y, and it is definitely a light scent (which is perfect because it sort of rises as the day wears on). The bottle is opaque (the liquid is dark yellow) and it's about the size of the palm of my hand. I've been a fan of this scent for a while now but you might want to be careful when ordering online because I think the one I got is old or something because it smelled strongly of rubbing alcohol for the first few squirts. After I shook it up and sprayed it a few more times the smell got tremendously better. Also, the bottle doesn't have a cap. It instead has a charm that wraps around the neck of the bottle to prevent it from spraying. Even though the hanging charm is cute, a cap would've been more convenient.",4
"Excellent smell of perfume for a reasonable price. I've always liked the smell since buying it the first time two years ago. The smell is moderate as in not too strong, and not too light.",5
"I only gave it 4 stars because it really didn't last a week. each day it gets noticeably lighter in the color it adds but it sure was easy to use in the shower and the 3 minutes it needed to stay on before rinsing went by faster than I thought. I used it first, then lathered up to get clean so it was done about the same time I was done washing and rinsing my body. Will be a great little travel fixer for your hair for those quick pick ups to your hair and my hair stayed soft and seemed a little fuller after using it. I'll definitely use it again.",4
"I've been using this for a week. This stuff makes my hair SO soft and shiny! Oh, nice coconut smell too. LOVE this!I use this as my daily moisturizer. It's sooo light.ALSO! I don't know how this product works but it totally smooths out new growth!If i get my hair damp, i can put this on and slide a tight hair band over my edges and they are completely smooth. The hair doesn't revert back. I like this better than my $18 jar of keracare edge control!Best kept secret...shhhhh!When Amazon starts selling this, buy it!",4
Not sure if this product is helping or not.  Have to use it a little longer to see the effects on my skin.,4
I recently purchased this blender sponge and HIGHLY recommend it.  I have used other sponges and none compare to this one.  It truly blends well and gives the illusion of wearing no makeup at all.  It's a worthwhile purchase.  I also purchased the cleaner for the sponge which I like as well.  It's not sudsy so it doesn't take forever to rinse out.  Get them both if you can.  Great purchase.,5

"These are incredibly tiny. They are hard to put on,  but with practice it should be better. Definitely is a lot.",3
"I love this perfume.  I couldn't find anything I liked when I finally found this one.  It smells great.  Even hours after applying it, I can still smell it.  I get compliments all the time.It's not over powering and does fade slowly through the day.  I like to spray it in my hair and in the inside of my elbow.  This helps the scent linger longer.",5
"I decided to try Maybelline Instant Rewind Radiant Firming Makeup because I felt it was time to give up the Bare Minerals and try something that would be more moisturizing and something that would not emphasize any fine lines I have (my skin is dry and prone to flaking from eczema but not sensitive to most products, I have fine lines on my forehead (""11s"" and worry lines) and faint nasolabial lines that only show up when I'm wearing the wrong foundation). I also saw that it had very good reviews on MUA. I have to say that I love this foundation! It makes me look so much younger than the BE foundation did! I doesn't sink into fine lines and is moisturizing. My skin had a dewy and natural finish and the flakiness I have was not emphasized or made worse. My skin was looking radiant again! Someone was even stunned when I told her I was 32 - she thought I was in my 20s! The coverage is medium, but you could thin it out if you wanted more sheer coverage, or build it if you wanted more full coverage. It has lasted the day every time I've worn it (even in the gym). I have tried it both with and without powder to set and have tried a few methods to apply it. I feel a stippling or foundation brush works better than blending it in with fingers. It also has SPF, which is always a plus with foundation. The only thing I don't care for is the packaging. I think a pump or a bottle you could squeeze would be much better. All of this for under $10! I am so glad I tried this!",5
"I love these lipsticks. They came in great time. The only negative was that they came all smooshed on the tops, but luckily none was broken. Overall they were quite beautiful. Happily grateful!",4
"I've tried Jergens sunless tanner and Hemp sunless moisturizer and neither one gave me instant dark color like this product...and neither gave me deep of a color - even gradually. I am pleased with this product. After having read all the good reviews, I decided to pick up a bottle locally since it was available at Target. I've been using this product for the last 3 weeks. I would warn not to apply too much of this because you could look a bit orange. Apply minimally until you've reached desired color. Blend very well. I highly recommend exfoliating every so often and moisturizing every time before applying this product. This seems to dry my skin so I use the Hemp sunless tanner on days I don't apply this. I think 1-2 times weekly use of this product would be sufficient. I realized this was drying my skin having snakeskin/scaley look in certain areas of my legs, so I scrubbed the area with my bath sponge and it removed the scaley appearance.For the price, I think this is a very good sunless tanner that doesn't stink.",5
"I bought this to clean under my nails.My intentions were to only use the smaller end/ Spoon Nail Cleaner.I liked the soft grip touch.The bigger end (Cuticle Pusher) does have a small chip on the left tip, inside corners. ( if held up like picture)This makes it a little rough & I would not use it against my toenail.The outer portion of the big end is completely smooth.I believe another reviewer already stated that.I knew this prior to my purchase so wasn't sure if hers had broken during transport.So, its probably came from the manufacture a defective.Three stars cause although I currently don't use the Cuticle pusher I never will cause of the chip.",3
"I bought this pair of shears to trim split ends. They are very sharp, easy to handle and compact. Good value.",5
I like how the nail polish looks when I am doing my nail art decorations. Its amazing how vivid the colors are and it does required 2 coats to appreciate the color but it is worth it,5
"It's very practical because it has the two brushes in one,the foundation brush allows you to use less product than a sponge and withouth using the fingers.The quality of the brush is good",4
"I bought this to put on my face at night in place of a moisturizer. I have a lot of acne scarring and was hoping it would help fade the scars, as many reviews said it would. I've been using it 5-7 nights per week for about 4 months now, and I don't notice much difference. I also didn't experience the next morning &#34;glow&#34; that many reviewers experienced. It didn't do anything bad to my skin, but just didn't do much different than a normal moisturizer would do. Might be worth a try, but I wouldn't repurchase. It does last quite a while - I've been using a generous amount each time as stated above, and still have about 1/2 of the 1 oz bottle left.",3
"I really like this product. This is the best leave in conditioner that i have found my naturally curly hair (4a, 4b). I like how thick it is, it melts in my hair leaving it really soft and moisturized. I cannot complain, this is a staple product in my natural hair regimen.",5
"I'm not one for hair product. I've had a very short haircut for a number of years. But I'm growing it out and I realize it needs a bit of guidance for the day.  I wanted something that let it look free, but not be like putting nothing in.  I also have dark brown hair, so I wanted something that didn't flake, and when I saw it might even help natural flakes, I thought this would be for me.The scent is pretty mellow, pleasant without being anything near powerful.  A little goes a surprisingly long way, so I have to comb in in for a bit to avoid white streaks.I'm getting this again once this bottle runs out.",4
"The Sedu seems to be OK I only had trouble with the seller Beauty and fragance because  I had the possibility next to my orders of being refunded if I have got a better price which I did and it wa snot honoured by seller , other than that, is an OK product. I still did not used it only tried it for some minutes to  see if it worked and this was taken by seller as used item. Oh well. The product is OK  but be carefu lwho you buy it form. This seller on the other hand did not know much about the product either. So  that is all the product seems to be OK.",4
"Also works the best for heat rash in hot, humid weather!  Works for me!I wish I had known about No-Rinse Body Bath when my Father was confined to his bed in a nursing home.My Father was in a wonderful, caring nursing home, so I called the Registered Nurse and recommended this wonderful  product.!",5
"Bought this after training on essential oils - jojoba itself has many direct benefits and can also be a carrier oil to dilute more expensive oil, so it is incredibly versatile and beneficial.  I selected this particular brand because it is organic, cold-pressed, unrefined, and because of the glass bottle with an eyedropper. I LOVE it!  I am using it personally for moisturizing skin and hair, and also with my healing touch practice to dilute essential oils.  Will definitely resupply right here!",5
"This contains enough product for me to do just my roots, which is perfect to cover those pesky stray grays between salon visits.  This works quickly within 10 minutes of application.  Im happy I tried this, no more wasting most of a regular bottle, easy applicator and this works so much quicker.",5
"I been searching 20 years for something to satisfy me and my hair, my hair has a life of its own being thicker then a lions mane and curly as can be without being a black woman haha. When my friend put this product in my hair about a year ago I heard angels sing.  I used to keep conditioner only in my hair because that's all I could do, my hair would get immune to anything else, I still put conditioner in my hair and leave it in because I wouldn't be Ble to comb it other wise but right after I put about a quarter size puddle in my hair while wet down to my roots to my ends, and that's all I have to do each day. It's been a year and never have I needed anything else. It doesn't make my hair oily because my hair without it is extremely dry, this is perfect for me.",5
"I really don't see any difference using products such as this on me.  If I had, Olay would be my preferred brand.  Don't waste your money, just buy a good moisturizer and cleaner.",2
"it's super cute, but I didn't like the thick consistency and it doesn't seem like it's very effective at moisturizing.",2
"I have light brunette hair that I've never dyed. I got this in Honey Blonde mainly for shine but also try to warm up the tone a touch. The hint of warmer tone I got, but shine honestly doesn't look much different :( If anyone has a good product for that reply to this please!Had to add an update: Looking closer, I do notice a bit more shine and when I flat-ironed my hair like another reviewer said wow, much shinier than usual. I guess just not as noticeable from a little farther away when my hair is still wavy. Also, really does make split ends look way better!",3
"I have thick, wavy, course hair and I love this straightener. I have been using it for years now and I have never had to replace it. Other straighteners took forever and left my hair frizzy but this one makes it smooth and soft. I will never use another straightener again. I hope this is never discontinued!",5
"I have always had fine hair and as I age it is getting thinner.  I am always on the look out for a hair product that can give me thicker looking hair and maybe stop me from hair loss.  This product goes on easy, it says to pump it many times where you part your hair, I also put some on other areas also.  Then you massage it in for one minute.  It does not seem greasy at all or too thick, just the right texture for me.  I do not notice any odor also as some have said.  What I really like is that, I can put it on at any time of day and my hair will not look greasy or like I have product in it, in fact, once I style my hair, it looks thicker.  I have seen some improvement and have not noticed bare areas lately.  I know that nothing will give me thick movie star hair. As long as it's an improvement and makes my hair seem fuller and no bare areas on my scalp, I'm happy.",3
"I purchased this product because I read that it was supposed to take the frizz out of your hair and make it soft and smooth.  Well, it didn't do anything like that.  I'm sorry, but would not purchase again.  Maybe it will work for someone that does not color their hair.",1
"MAC's Desire lipstick looks very dark in the tube, but once it goes on, it looks like a rich berry color. Just right. Not pink and not orange. It is a bluish based burgundy. It also feels really nice on. Creamy but not heavy. There is no taste and no noticeable smell, which I really like. After eating, the color still looked good and didn't dry out. I wouldn't mind wearing this anytime, but it probably would go best when you're all dressed up. I would recommend going to a store like Dillards to try out different colors before you buy whether you buy in store or online. Don't trust your monitor to represent actual color. There's nothing like seeing it in person and trying it on. The ladies at the MAC counter are very helpful and will assist you with finding the right cosmetic, no matter what you're looking for. They helped me find a great foundation, mineral powder and lipstick. Dillard's also has a 30 day guarantee on their products - doesn't matter if you use them or not.",5
"This is a very dark brown, almost a black-brown. I haven't had any issues with it staying in place. Goes on smoothly without any tugging or pulling. Stays in place for 8+ hours, give or take. Works for me!",5
I bought the salamon color thinking that was nude - it is too orange for me - I bought this and it is a perfect shade of light pink.  Would be perfect for french.,5
I use this in the morning with olay buffer thingy and my skin just loves it! rinse with cold water to lock in all the good minerals. My niece told me about this soap and her complexion is flawless. Leaves shin refreshed and not dry ( I have dry skin). Will not be without this soap!,5
"CG Flamed Out Mascara is just the right formula for my lashes.  It goes on smoothly, with no clumping or pulling of lashes.  One or two strokes with the brush is all I required for thicker and longer looking lashes.  I think I have finally found just what I was looking for in a mascara.",4
"Very smooth, silky coverage.  Sets great with powder.  Lots of colors and easy to mix between shades. Seems to be pretty long lasting, will purchase again.",5
"I really like this product. It does a great job of removing all my makeup and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I can tell my skin is softer and more moisturized.However, the smell is very peculiar. It smells like my grandmother's perfume exploded on my face. And it lingers throughout the day. I would buy more of these products but that smell is a bit too much to handle.",3
I wouldn't use any other product for my nails.  My manicurist doesn't carry it so I take it with me.  Lasts for a good three weeks without a problem.,5
I received this product 3 days ago and have been following the instructions as directed.  I've tried other products in the past with no results or have broken out severely.  With this product my skin is not breaking out and it's not greasy at all.  I absolutely love it!,5
"Love these false lashes. They feel good, comfy to wear and are dramatic but natural at the same time. Obsessed.&lt;3",5
I truly like this product. I have used for a couple weeks now. Can see a real difference in my hair. Leaves it manageable and shiny. I have used as a hot oil treatment by warming and... You can see the rest of my review at: http://bamagramma.com/insta-natural-argan-oil-hair-treatment-arganoilhairtreatment/,5
"Received package on schedule, but there was a shattered bottle with polish on ALL the other bottles. There was also one bottle that was Blue Diamond (a glitter), so I'm missing one of the holos.",2
"Nice and soft, they blend makeup very good , I do recommend getting these sponges because they're not expensive and work just as well as a beauty blender from your local drug store. They're also easy to clean I use &#34;Baby Magic&#34; body/shampoo",4
"I really like this tanner. I am fair/medium skin with freckles. It leaves my skin a nice golden brown. It dries pretty quickly. I am using it on my face too and looks very natural. I apply it with a sunless tanner mitt and think that is key to getting it so even and not streaky. It smells like sunless tanner once you have it on for an hour or so, but I put it on at night and shower in the morning, so not a big deal.I highly recommend trying this product!",5
I love this after tanning lotion! It has a fabulous fruity scent that lingers for a little while and feels really light. It's also a great deal on Amazon! It is about three times this price at my local tanning salon.,5
"As someone else said this is a game changer.  I walk my pups in the morning, get kids off to school, remind my husband of everything he has planned for the day and what he needs, then a shower before I go to work.  In the past month or so I have been resorting to letting my hair lay limp and do its own thing...why, because I just didn't have the time to dry and then style.  This is fantastic.  I have fine hair, and I use the straightener while it's damp.  It heats up quickly I use it on setting 20. My hair dries and straightens and flips in less than 7 minutes.  It's perfect for me.  Does my hair look amazingly perfect...no...do I look like the hot mess I had been looking like...no.  I look like I spent a little time making myself presentable.  I'm satisfied with the look, the ease of use, and the quick time it takes.",5
ehh not the most impressive OPI color I have used.  This is not as opaque as I thought it would be and not as shimmery as I would have liked.  Basically a translucent sandy white.  It also chips very easily which is not unusual for textured polishes.,3
"I had a skin issue (basically pre-cancer) on my nose from years of skiing and running outdoors without proper protection. I'm ok but the Dermatologist said I need to wear at least a SPF 30 on my face. I usually just put sunscreen on my nose, but sometimes I put it all over if I am going to be out for a while. I bought a brand that said &#34;invisible.&#34; Far from it. After you put that brand on, it literally looks like a white powder is all over your face. This product actually blends in and doesn't leave your skin oily looking either. Finally a product that I feel ok putting on my face on a daily basis. Plus it was a great price!",5
"absolutely LOVE these rollers because first, they are rubber type with metal clips which holds hair perfectly and distributing heat precisely. After buying first set, i ran to buy another since my hair is medium length. LOVED the bouncy curls with such an elegant view.",5
I suffer from eczema and so far this is the only cream that stops my itchiness.  It feels heavy at first but after a while you almost don't feel it.,5
This stuff is amazing! It definitely is crack for your hair! It makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry. It also doesn't weigh my hair down after I use it. With thinning hair that can be a huge problem! I only use a dab and it seems to cover my entire hair. This will last forever but I love it!,5
"The tips is really thin , buy it if you want that kind of eye liner . I repeat  very thin . It was good for a month or two. It dried up very quickly",3
"JBCO protein conditioner came on time, good service. It does not have a great smell but I apply it to my scalp every night.",5
I have tried other serums and always come back to Olay Regenerist.  There is one other serum I have liked as well however it costs over $100.00 for an ounce and smells really good but does not work any better.  Olay Regenerist leaves skin silky and makes my skin feel very protected.  I highly recommend and will continue to buy this serum.,5
"I love this stuff soo much i cant explain, honestly i always thought that ors products were kinda expensive but then again i am a bit frugal. the size of the jar is matching to the price so i had to get it, my hair is a bit coarse at times but it smooths my edges down and leaves it with a refreshing scent love love love will recommend this to anyone that wants an alternative to hair gel that leaves your hair hard, this leaves it managable and soft",5
"I received this quickly.  I made a face mask with this powder and distilled water, left on for 20 minutes and rinsed off.  It doesn't take much quantity to cover your entire face and the results are very nice. It was easy to apply and easy to rinse off.Also, my husband hurt his finger doing yard work so I made a poultice with this clay, powdered mustard and apple cider vinegar.  He kept his finger wrapped in it for 15 minutes and was amazed how quickly it took the soreness away.I also used the clay powder as an ingredient in homemade mineral veil (clay powder, arrowroot powder and cocoa powder) and it works nicely for that as well.  I'm very pleased with this product and will definitely order it again.",5
"My stylist recently gave me a small trial bottle of Pravana Fresh dry shampoo. I fell in love with this product! Gives my hair new life on the &#34;second day&#34;. I have thinning hair, and Pravana makes it look thick and healthy without smelling like spray paint. The scent of this stuff is amazing. Nothing chemical about it. Great product, well worth the price over other brands for the smell alone!",5
"While I did originally recieve the wrong product (shampoo instead of conditioner). When I called the company they immediately sent me out a the correct product and even allowed me to keep the shampoo, which I recieved the next day. All-in-all they did a good job and I would have no problem purchasing from them again.",4
"This is almost completely invisible. I would not call it pink, because there's no color on my nails after using this.",1
"I was getting really desperate.  After searching and buying many products to help my damaged/fried, fine, colored/highlighted hair which i have been flat ironing daily I think I finally hit the nail on the head!  I tried Biolage Ultra conditioning balm, Neutrogena Triple Mositure deep recovery hair mask, Got2b Styltini, Redken All Soft Heavy cream, Redken Antisnap, another Neutrogena deep conditioner I can't recall the name, Phytospecific hair mask, Kerastase Nutritive and that's not the complete list!!  I don't know if it's my hair type.  I have mostly gray hair which as i said is processed.  None of the above products made any difference.  My hair was dry and when I flat ironed or combed it, it was breaking off so much that my sink was full of hair.  I was scared to death because my hair was getting thinner everday. Oh, and my hair stylist recommended Sebastian Cellophane to make my hair thicker and ta da....nothing!  I learned of this product on a beauty/makeup review website and out of desperation decided to tried the mask and the spray on leave-in from Amazon.com.  After one use of both products I couldn't believe the difference.  I did my usual routine, and almost no hair breakage when I flatironed.  My hair was soft and shiny!  Yes, my hair is a bit weighed down, but that's not too bad as it seems to manage the frizz better.  Out of curiosity to see how long the effects last (ie. cummulative), after two uses, I've been trying different products to see if I need to use this every time.  I've tried skipping the mask using the Neutrogena one with just the It's a miracle leave spray.  So far I'm having good results.",5
"This smells SO GOOD. I can't emphasize that enough - I love the scent. Makes my hair literally feel like silk, but only a mask. Has to be used weekly.",5
I hate the feeling on my hair after I used this shampoo ..it feels dry ..and I don't like the smell hate ..DO NOT BUY,1
"For years, I have searched for a replacement for my one-and-only &#34;rat-tailed&#34; hair brush.  It's the only kind of brush that works on my springy, curly gray hair.  When I found these in Amazon.com, I ordered them immediately.  They came in a pack of three and were exactly what I wanted.  Now, I'm happier with my hair, and I have a &#34;Tease Brush&#34; in three convenient places.  Thanks again, Amazon.com.",5
"I used to use Dior Show, Lancome Hypnosis, or Badgal Lash then I eventually switched to Almay Intense I-Color Mascara but the bottle dries out in a week and I noticed that even with makeup remover it was tough on my lashes to get it off. Luckily I tried L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara because I love it as much as my Badgal and it is a 4th of the cost. For people who have problems with clumping they probably aren't swiping the excess off the brush before they apply and they have to finish one I completely before they switch to the other. To apply with a clean brush simply hold the wand handle and slide the bristles against the opening of the bottle so there aren't any goopy areas on the brush. I use to do this with my Dior show as well. In addition to applying with a clean brush, you will also want to start at the base of your lash line and use a zig-zag motion as you draw the wand up your lashes. If you are getting clumps then just work on your application. A lot of the thickening/volume mascaras will look clumpy if you don't clean ans zig-zag. You can also use a lash comb right after applying (before it sets) if you want to get every lash combed out but this will reduce the thick look of your lashes. In addition to this note that can hopefully help you make a choice these are some additional pros.Pros:- Thickens and Lengthens- Doesn't clump when used correctly- The Carbon Black is a nice deep black color- Depending on your look for the day you can do a light one coat or layer it on to do that sex kitten eye look- I think it healed my lashes from the damage the Almay brand did, really nourishing- Washes off easily, I don't even need makeup remover now, yay!- I'm only on day 20 with this but I do think it will last the full month-Curved brush so you can really get every lash and sweep them upward",5
My nephew used this and really likes the fragrance and good clean feeling.  I have to agree with him that it is really nice to be around him.  The cost is a bit spendy but since he is happy it is worth it in our opinion.,5
"I absolutely love all the skincare products I've tried from Neutrogena but I must say this is not one of their best ones. I have a pretty oily tzone so I wanted to try something I could use in the morning to wash my face and then put some makeup on and not have to worry about being a shiny mess at the end of the day. I quite like washing my face with this, don't get me wrong. It definitely leaves your skin feeling clean but in terms of controlling oil and shine this is not very effective. Some days I don't even go outside my house and start getting shiny/oily in about 30 minutes which is ridiculous for a cleanser that claims to control it for several hours! Reading other reviews it seems like it works for some people but it didn't do it for me in terms of oil control. I haven't stopped using this because it's still a nice cleanser so I say it's worth a shot if you're looking for something new. It might work for you, right?",3
"I bought the SHANY plates to try and this to use as a stamper and scraper. The scraper is good for one thing and that is SCRATCHING the plates, it doesn't remove the polish well. and the stamper DOES NOT pick the images. I tried different plates thinking maybe the plates are defective, but it still didn't work. I mean it's cheap, but still a TOTAL WASTE of $4.50",1
"I haven't had any problems with these on my fine to medium hair. I love that there are different widths and that you get so many. I keep them everywhere, car, purse, work, so I can always put my hair up when I want to.",5
I had to write this review.  I am writing this review because of how well the product works.  Worth your money!,5
"These brushes are very soft & cute. I love the pink & white color. I didn't use the storing case because I have my own makeup drawer, but it was handy nonetheless but cheap looking. The hair in the brushes don't fall out & stay soft & straight.It comes with many tools & I use almost 1/2 of them. I don't use all of them though.Although the colors of makeup might stay in the brush since it is a little bit hard to clean, it doesn't really bother me.",5
"I am still using this product. I loved it. I use it for tracks and also to hold head ties and hats. If you are on to make your own wigs, this product is for you.",5
"I definitely noticed a difference in the tone & quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles, skin looks younger & softer.  I use this in the morning along with the lotion - age repair SPF30 and the eye restoration cream.  At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  This skin tightening serum lasts me about 2 months as you really do not use alot.  Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.",5
"LIKE THIS PRODUCT LEAVES FRESH FACE, a skin LOSANA, prepares for makeup, creams to get,SKIN MAKES BETTER. A GOOD PRODUCT,",4
"This is an amazing wig!  You would never guess it was such a cheap wig.  I will be recommending this to everyone I know.  It looks so much better than the picture.  I will be buying one or two more just in case I wear this one out.I am going through chemotherapy and am losing my hair.  I can't afford any of the expensive wigs they sell in stores around here but this wig looks better than any of them!  I had to take it in to have my hairdresser trim the bangs for me and she was so shocked by it's quality I had to send her the link on Amazon so she can recommend it to her other clients.Seriously, buy this wig!",5
"My normal to oily hair doesn't need much conditioning except for those days when I've been out in the Florida sun and summertime wind: gardening, the beach, boating.  Even with a hat or headcovering the heat and humidity cause my hair to become frizzy and straw-like.This Dove Hair Therapy leave on conditioner is lightweight and has a light smell, reminiscent of coconut.  I've only used it on damp hair and it spreads easily, though it's can be a bit sticky until it dries.  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  It's not something I'll use everyday, but I'll definitely need this product this summer.  It's a nice addition to my normal hair care routine.The bottle recommends using a ""quarter-size portion"", so a 4 fl oz bottle should last months on my short hair.",4
I use it before I go to bed. Works great for me! Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft. I have been using it on scars from acne to cat scratches and they disappear in a matter of days. I find the smell of it to be wonderful and calming. Highly recommend!,5
"great color, not a full frosted polish...just a little shimmer.  deep color, applies and wears very well.  very sophisticated and a great 'winter' color",5
I love this polish! It's so versatile. I suggest using this on dark polish. You can't really see the matte effect on light colors. Ensure you leave your base color to dry completely before applying the matte color. Leave the coat to dry and apply a second coat if needed. I didn't use a top coat but others have recommended it.,5
My husband is using this instead of Burt's Bees because is moisturizes his hair better. I started to buy more that I can use it also for my hair.,5
"My hubby hated giving me back rubs before, but this makes it way easier to get a knot out and smells great!  It's a little oily but not bad.  Great for dry feet right before bed.",5
"Soon as you spray it, you've got color!!  The fumes arent harsh but it still kinda stinks.  I strongly suggest laying towels down while you do it because my floor got a tan, too :P.  So far I like it.  I didnt turn orange, I turned tan hahah.  Shipping was super fast!!  It arrived 2 days after I placed the order (standard shipping).  The package wasnt damaged at all.  Very impressed.Well, I loved it last night... Then I got in the shower and it washed off almost completely..  I say almost becase I am blochy now.  On my chest, ankles, shoulders, legs and back..  I think I will stick to my neutrogena micromist thank you.",2
"There are no instructions included with the product to indicate how to apply the mineral oil based therapy treatment beyond -- massage into hair and scalp. No guidance regarding quantity to use or length of time it should remain on the hair before it is rinsed out or if the treatment should be left on the hair, etc.And, the label states  --  provides light non-greasy nourishment to scalp and hair. Well, that is patently ridiculous. I tried it on dry hair and was left with a greasy mess. I tried it on wet hair and was left with a greasy mess. The first ingredient in the product is mineral oil, and it makes a big greasy mess. On the plus side, the scent is light and pleasant.If there is a trick to using this product that would permit a decent result I don't know what it is. As it stands, I'm a little put-off that decent instructions aren't provided. Why are we left to guess how the product should be applied?",1
I have been struggling with skin blemishes during the winter months.  My skin really does well with this product.Pros:  It helps decrease acne.  My skin reacts just like having sunlight.Cons: Very time consuming to actually do the treatment.  I usually just focus on areas that are starting to break out as opposed to following the directions that include over 45 minutes of the whole face.,4
I honestly don't have the right set up right now to do this everyday like I should but I did end up trying it in the shower on my back since I get blackheads there and it worked rather well. I think it would help my face if I could just do it everyday.,4
The colors are wonderful and the coverage is excellent. The palette arrived on time and in secure packaging. I am extremely happy with the purchase.,5
This is a great product and offers good coverage with. I like this product on my acrylic nails and I am able to go longer between fills.,5
"I have very, very light blonde color treated hair that never seems to stay true to color between colorings. Between this product and the Fekkai Color Care Shampoo, my color now stays almost perfect the whole six weeks. I love it. Plus it smells nice - a little bit like grapefruit.The only thing that worries me is now that Proctor & Gamble has taken this label over, will it stay the same product or just morph into another high priced flavor of shampoo on the shelf at the store? I'll be watching closely. P&G; is one of those monster brands that seems to make a billion vanilla flavored products from soup to nuts and none of them are remarkable, just okay. Can a company who makes toilet paper really be an expert on the vagaries of premium haircare? We'll see.",5

"My son is liking this gel to give his hair some shine and to create his signature do.  Basically he makes most of his hair stand up in the front in a formation that we lovingly refer to as ""the unicorn"".  If this gel can provide enough hold for the clumped and stuck up in the air style that my son loves then it will provide enough hold for other less extreme styles as well.  I also combed his hair into a more clean cut look as the gel's name suggests and this looked nice but he did not keep it in that style for long.  I tried using this Axe gel to slick my hair back and it kept it off my face all day.  The citrus like scent is not too heavy for younger kids.",5
This color is pink metallic color. It is very nice and subtle. I love wearing this color and then putting the June Bride color over and it is beautiful. My mom likes this color alone because it is light and not too flashy.,4
"Guess not popular due to price.  I agree.  That said here is what I like:After quite a few years of weekly use no diminishment in filing speed.  Length is 7"" so you can make long strokes and it flexes nicely.  Wash it about every two months cleans out file dust for faster filing.  Note the diamond filing is on one side only.  Since it seems to last forever does not matter.At this high cost I am careful to keep in one place and put away right after use.  Oh, one more thing;  between #1 and #2 I have not tried #1 but my #2 is medium cutting at best meaning it could be slightly coarser not less with my large male finger and toe nails.  Female might like #1 but this #2 will file smoothly and fast.  A little slow on my ""big"" toe nails.Highly recommend getting quality clippes too.  Bought Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper $18+/-.  Work fine on fingers too.  Also pricey but compared to Revelon they are much sharper, better steel, and just feel better in the hand.  Also had them for five plus years.  Too $$$ to loose and I am careful.  Do cutting and filing right after shower, much easier when nails are soft.",4
When looking for inexpensive this is a good solid choice.I have thick curly shoulder length hightlighted 50 year old hair and need a conditioner that will tame it enough to allow me to brush it out before I add any leave in treatment and this fits the bill.You can't go wrong with Suave.,3
"I have used a couple other dry shampoo products that I liked, but this one is the best so far. It smells great, and my hair feels cleaner after I use it.",5
Good price for the caps.  But honestly it is a little cheap filling.  I have had better processing caps.  I will probably look for another brand when I but again.  I wear clips in my hair while I have the caps on and I fear that they will push a hole through because of the thinness of the plastic.,3
ok this is Great for SHORT wigs but if you are styling or trying to keep a long or heavy wig on this thing it WILL SHIFT,4
This moisturizer makes my skin so soft and with the added benefit of a &#34;tan&#34; makes it even better....much better than Jergens,4
I've never had super nice brushes which made eyeshadow application a bit hard. These brushes really do make SO much difference with blending and precise application of colors. I think the price for the 6 brushes is great! Can't wait to buy the face brushes.,5
"(Disclaimer: I got this product free from Influenster and am posting a review as part of an entry to submit - however, all opinions and thoughts are my own)I and my hubby both used this product and he LOVED it, while I was ok with it. The only issue for me is the strong scent that it has. It's not a BAD scent, just strong and &#34;manly&#34; smelling - so that can be a little off-putting when I am just trying to moisturize my legs. However, it does what it says it will - it goes on fast, absorbs fast, and leaves your skin nice and moisturized. So for that, I think it is definitely a good buy.",4
So far so good.  My hair is more healthy since using this cap.  My scape gets the deep conditioning it so needed.,4
this cleanser smells soooooo bad. the consistency is similar to milk gone bad. the only good thing is that it leaves your skin smooth but I don't think is worth the trouble. plus i was looking for a cleanser not for a moisturizer. I wont buy it again. i am now stuck with a product i hate for 1 more month ugh :/,2
Very pretty color but it doesn't last on lips or cheeks.Fades almost immediately.Disappointed and hope the manufacturer fixes this problem.,2
I am loving this stuff!  It smells so good you almost wish it was edible.  It really cleans and degunks my face well.  I will buy it again in the future when I run out.,5
"A 3 heart score from me...this products smell is so unique.  It cannot be found just anywhere.  I enjoy the subtle smell it offers the wearer, when you walk into a room, you know your there, so do others, as this unique scent carries with you all day long.  I will re-order more '",5
"Real cosmetics have a smell about them, the way a woman should smell.I lucked out the color is good too!",5
"I love the scent of the K-Pak reconstructor so much I bought these, but they smell nothing alike and not particularly great. My hair seems to like it okay but for me it's nothing special and not really worth the price.",4
"These are surprisingly short for free edge extension. They would work for the typical client, but if your client likes really long nails you should carry another form. I do appreciate that these are reusable and I can disinfect them for use on my next client.",3
"This Bay Rum aftershave has a strong cinnamon smell to it that quickly settles down to a very pleasant milder scent.  I like it, and it feels good on my face after a shave.  My only complaint is the scent fades very quickly, which is surprising given how enduring the scent of Clubman's Pinaud aftershave is.  If you want an aftershave to make your face feel good after shaving this is a good one to choose.  But if you want one that will have a scent throughout your day you will be happier with something else.",3
"I use this product on a daily basis and it is awesome. It does not leave your eyebrows hard or strange looking, it does not dry up and shed and it goes on smoothly and hold my eyebrow hair in place. I love it so much, definitely recommend it.",5
This works great other than having to clean the tub more. Light smell but nothing overpowering. Great for in the tub or in foot soak. I also mixed it with Lavender Epsom salt for tight muscles.,5
"I've used this mascara for years and years.  I try other brands once in a while but I always go back to the Voluminous.  I think it beats the department store brands hands down and with the price of L'Oreal being so affordable, there's no excuse for not changing out your mascara every month as is recommended.  I use the auto ship on Amazon so when the package comes, I know it's time to throw out the old one.",5
"After years of trying to get my mother on board with skincare I finally did it. I don't even know how many products that I gave her went unused and then for some mystical reason she actually used this! Not only did she like it, but she started receiving compliments on how well rested she looked and now she calls me to get her more before the jar runs out!I know this brand is a little pricey but to us it is worth it.",5
This is very good for removing all the layers I have on my nails after one week of applying strengthener. Very pleased with it.,5
"I was so excited when (after very disciplined regular usage) I saw amazing results. But sure enough, after stopping, only a week or two later I was back at square one! It does work though, so if you have no problem using it for the rest of your life, or just need it for a time when you want those results albeit temporary, then go for it, you won't be disappointed. I only give it a low rating because I was hoping it would be a permanent solution.",2
"I love this container, and it had great price for the product, I recommend for everyone and would definitely buy again if the price and quality stays the sames",5
"I had to decrease my beauty budget, and unfortunately can't afford to spend 40 or 50 like I used to. I honestly don't see how this product is different than higher end mineral foundations that I've used.Perfect amount of medium coverage (use a flat brush to cover darker spots, like under your eyes), and doesn't look wrinkly or powdery. Matches my pale skin tone great, and evens out my freckles and flushed face.I love it!",5
I really like this. Makes nice sharp points for my pencils. I have just one fat pencil that doesnt fit though. The cover stays closed and doesnt spill the shavings out.,4
"This case is nice but a bit flimsy. The makeup inside is NOT Shany its Cameo. I bought this expecting Shany quality and its not. Its nice and holds most of my stuff. I bought it to hold my Shany makeup pallets but it does not. It's to small. This case is nice for younger girls just starting out but for older women, you may want something more sturdy and bigger to carry all the necessities.",3
"This product is a bit heavier than other hair glosses I've used.  I have naturally curly hair that tends to get frizzy in humidity, and gloss products often alleviate that.  This product is too heavy to put on dry hair, as it leaves my dry hair looking greasy.  On wet hair, it spread out better and did seem to control the frizz and add some shine.",3
"Came weeks early, perfect cut, cheap price and with a great price! Highly recommend for at home or salon use.",5
Great mirror. Doesn't fog up really.  But don't get the smaller one. I can't imagine how small that is because this one isn't huge!  Look at the provided dimensions for true size.,5
I have always loved Burt's Bees products and this moisturizer is no different. It feels silky on my skin and holds up the entire day. I love that it is made from natural ingredients. The only thing that could make this better would be if it contained a sunscreen.,5
"This isn't my ""holy grail"" as some people have told it was for them; however, I do like the product. There is a definite oil""er"" feeling to my face without this product. Now, if you ask me if it's worth so much....meh. It's an ok product and it's probably something I can go without. On the up side, it lasts for an extremely long time! I use it everyday under my light makeup and , after 9-10 months, I've only used about 2/5 ish.",4
This is the second bottle that I have purchased since it seems to have the same consistency and applies the same as the SkinCeuticals product. I'm definitely happy with the product and the price and will continue getting this product and try others by this company.,5
"I've been using this lotion as a natural alternative to my philosophy products, since finding out I was pregnant.  I feel good about the ingredients but the lotion takes a long time to absorb. It leaves my body feeling sticky. Overall though, it does a great job of moisturizing.",4
"It's great for guys aswell as I been using this product myself. The shipping was fast it took about 3 days I belive. The black can sometimes be way to dark so with simply one dab with the brush it's enough for an entire eyebrow, Lasts all day. The only complaint is the brushes are really small about half of my pinky finger so it's hard to handle but besides that nothing else and worth buying!",4
"This palette is great - most of the colors are very wearable on my fairly dark skin (I wear MUFE HD 178/180), except for the chalkier colors at the top.  I wear these shadows wet (most of the time) over my UDPP in Original or in Greed for maximum color payoff.  If you have darker skin, I really recommend wearing it over Greed - I have found that the colors show up better over the gold base than over the clear Original primer.The Original CS palette is pretty decent, but a lot more of the colors on that palette are very chalky when compared to this one.  I have dark skin, so I can't play games with my eyeshadows since it's so hard to make them show up on me in the first place.  This palette is cheap and worth every penny.",5
Such an amazing and soft brush. I'm very happy with my purchase! I've heard so many girls talk about these brushes and they are definitely worth the hype; this brush especially! Love love love!,5
"These are nice, I probably wouldn't order them again mostly based on they lose shiny luster if you use a top coat. They are nice, you don't get too many of the bigger, more usable sizes, the little tiny ones are microscopic (which could be good for very intricate nail art) but they have so much static between them and the plastic container they come in, it was hard to grab & use them even with tweezers.",4
"If your hair is particularly susceptible to products creating a greasy look, be aware that this is probably not the &#34;lightweight&#34; nourishing treatment you are looking for.  I'm still waiting for the lightweight oil treatment that supposedly does not leave hair looking greasy. The only people who look great with wet looking hair are models, and that is not my profession.  Still, it is a good product for repair purposes.The Dove treatment is useful for treating hair that is tired and has been abused by winter, hard water, irons, dryers, or other things.  In my case, it entails a bit of planning to use this product.  I usually apply it on a Friday evening so my hair doesn't look so greasy when I return to work a couple of days later.Macadamia is a fantastic scent.  The smell of an actual macadamia nut farm is beyond comparison to this product, but I don't know if you could ever replicate a nut farm's scent completely.This is a nice product, but plan ahead before use.",4
Love using this with cleziderm orange face wash and green 5% bpo lotion. Amazing results and best prices for these products.,5
"This hair oil is a great product.  My hair was damaged from taking prednisone and no doubt from too much heat.  I bought a pony tail, stopped using my flat iron and blow dryer, put a Dr. Miracle relaxer in my hair and started using this oil  My hair is repaired, long, bone straight and soft.  This stuff smells terrible but I don't care.  I've got my hair back!!",5
"Salon quality hair dryers can run upwards of $130-230.  But this hair dryer provides much of their technology and power, at a fraction of the cost.  At 1875 Watts, its powerful airflow gets your hair dry quickly.  It includes 3 fan settings and 3 heat settings, plus the cold shot button which you can use to quickly alternate between warm/hot air and cold air to set your style.  The element is designed to distribute airflow so that you don't get hotspots in your blowdrying, which can damage your hair.  This is important to me, since not only do I use it to blow dry my own thick, long Asian hair (which dried very quickly using this hairdryer), but on my wigs which are made of more fine, European virgin hair which cost over $1000 and I don't want anything damaging them.  I also found that I was able to blow dry my wigs very quickly and without the frizziness that sometimes accompanies the styling.The hairdryer is a bit larger than I was accustomed to, so it can be awkward to move your arms around to make room.  That said, I was surprised that it wasn't too heavy and was actually lighter than many of the smaller models I've used before.  It was also fairly quiet, as hair dryers go, which made me comfortable with using it in a neighboring room when my daughter was napping.  I also like the removeable filter, which makes periodic cleaning of the dryer easier.I did find the rocker buttons annoying.  Although the box boasts ""professional-style rocker switches"" (seriously, though, what are ""professional-style"" buttons?), I found the switches could flip off and on or warm/hot/cold by accident if you were clumsy or not careful with your fingers.  Since the handle is fairly bulky, it wasn't too hard to avoid accidentally flipping the switches, but I would think that sliding switches would have been better.The hair dryer also comes with a bonus Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, which will help smooth your hair while drying.  It worked just fine, but I prefer and recommend the use of BioSilk when working with your hair and heated appliances such as hairdryers or straightening irons.",5
"Pros: has no scent, and is a thick rich cream.Cons: leaves skin sticky; however by next morning it will have been absorbed. Don't like as a day belly cream, using is at bedtime.",3
"I bought this even though I was a little afraid that beige would be too dark for me (I'm brunette with light complexion), and fortunately it works great! I don't have super-intense dark circles under my eyes, but enough to make me look tired sometimes, and this product provides good coverage. Also good for blemishes, any redness, etc. Would buy again.",5
This make-up is good if you are running late and need to put your face on in a hurry. It does look good at first but a couple of hours later it looks like I forgot to put foundation on. I have combination skin. It covers my red areas at first and fades away. I use it on top of liquid foundation and I do like it then.,3
This is a great product for your next day hair. All you need to do is spray it and your off. I highly recommend this product for people who have curly hair.,5
I have struggled with extremely dry skin on my face for a few years now. I have tried every expensive moisturizer on the market. I bought a Tree Hut product at a yard sale and liked it so much I looked them up. When I saw this product I had to try it (along with the shower wash). Both products are great. After only a couple of weeks my face has stopped flaking and is not red and painful. So much relief without spending a fortune!  I can't say enough good things about these products.,5
"Hides any grease and shine from my hair and smells very fresh, only bad thing is I noticed I get tons of dandruff after using it.",3
This arrived super quick. The sender covered it in a lot of bubble wrap securing it very well. I am very happy with this product.,5
I am a long time user of this product. I REALLY enjoy having these smaller tubes available because I keep them all over the house. I use this A LOT on dry lips and certainly around my eyes. Shipping was quick. Will buy again. Thank you.,5
It is okay.............did not experience problems with this shampoo and conditioner set.  It has been a while since I used this set as I went back to my Wen.  I am addicted to Wen.  I felt this set would be good because it is sulfate free and I don't think it hurts to switch up now and then.  To be fair ........I truly cannot remember how this shampoo and conditioner worked for me because I am writing this review several months after I used it.  I will no doubt use it again when my other shampoo runs out.,3
Lot's of brushes to work with only thing that bummed me out just a little was there was no &#34;fluffy&#34; brush for blending in eye shadow into your crease but other than that really like these brushes!,5
Great,5
the older version of the mousse was like fine hair nirvana  this is ok at best  gives some guts to baby fine hair without the gunky feeling but i was hoping for more,3
"Hello. I researched several texturizers and this brand before my purchase.  Thank you to all who wrote a review; it helped me. I am a girl of color with tightly spiral curls. Growing up, I used perms to straighten my hair because most of my friends were, but that hid and masked my TRUE hair texture. I have not had a perm for several years and really adore and appreciate the texture and richness God has blessed me and all of you with as well.I read about texturizers and that seemed to strong for my hair. I never needed a perm on my hair; it is a cultural myth handed to many by societal norms and media. Nonetheless, I wanted something to loosen my curl pattern because I have thick, rich hair and did not want that to be hidden by chemical processing.The reviews on this product were mostly positive, but I still waited a few days after I bought it because I did not want more chemicals. I prayed. I had peace about doing this so I did!!I am SO happy that I did. I almost over processed my hair by leaving it on too long, but it came out perfect. Let me explain - briefly: I followed the directions EXACTLY. I did the strand test (4-5 minutes max - that's it according to instructions), and combed it through - not smooth it out with my hands like you do for perms. I followed the time for course hair, which was 12-16 minutes, but I should have followed the time for medium hair (8-10 minutes I believe). My hair is not course. That why I said I almost over-processed, but did not.Suggestion: read the instructions. This product loosened my curls without removing it. Gave me the sired look that I wanted!! Thanks. :)",5
So far I love this product it is the perfect color and makes my skin feel great. BUT haha I have learned that once you put it on if you don't blend immediatelyit is streaky XD OOPS but other then that it goes on great. And I would buy it again,4
"I bought this on the recommendation of my friend for easier removal of glitter nail polish.  Just as told, it works great.  I have enough to last quite a long time with the 32 oz bottle.",5
"I used to use an eyeliner pencil but wanted a softer look.""Color Tattoo"" can be applied with an artist paintbrush andthe look is more subtle and natural. I've had my pot for 6+months now and still love using it. It comes off very easilywith Vaseline and tissue. But I dont like all the chemicalsin it so will probably try to find a greener brand once itruns out. But if you're on a budget -- this is the one to try.",4
"I really wanted this to work! I have very fine thinning blonde hair that has been coming out heavily in the shower daily for 2 years. I'd hoped this would at least slow the hair loss down a bit.  I have Hashimoto's Thyroid disease and nothing they've tried has helped with my hair loss so this was my sort of &#34;last resort&#34;.  While I know that it may be my thyroid disease at fault here, I also started getting cystic acne for the first time in my life (60+). In reading one other review, I think I may have found the culprit.  So here is my review:A) after religiously taking this for 2 months - this product did not do anything to slow hair loss in this 60 year old with Hashimoto'sB) it seems to have caused cystic acne in several people, including me.I will not buy again, there are several herbal supplement here on Amazon that I will try next.",1
"I really like this curler. I have never used a wand curler before, but it was quite easy to master. I suggest watching some YouTube videos on wand curlers. :)",5
I bought this at nordstroms not here but I just love this and can see a difference right away. I am 27 and just love it.,5
I found nothing special about this mascara. It flaked and did not volumize my lashes. This company claims that this mascara is waterproof and will stay on until you take it off. Not true. Returned it and will use another brand that I have trusted for many years.,2
"Such quality! my salon started using this company, and they say they get really great reviews. I love the smooth finish and glow.",5
"This remedy help with the back pain I was experiencing.  I don't know how three sprays in the mouth work like that but it did -- enough to let me get to sleep.  This product does not solve the problem that is causing the pain, it helps relieve it only.  You have to turn to diet or something else to find out what is causing this back pain.  In my case I had Candida Yeast infection in the muscles.  It  took about three months of detoxing with other homeopathic remedies and natural food to fix the problem.",5
I have been using this cleanser for many years and will continue to do so. This product was recommended by my doctor of 13 years whom I highly trust.,5
"The lip gloss is cheaply made, it absorbs in your skin after a few minutes it does not even stay shiney at all! It's made out of oil! there's nothing glossy about it! LAME. I bought better stuff for a dollar that was million times better and stayed on! Try the shea butter lip glosses",1
"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black ""purifying grains"" in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don't like strongly-perfumed soaps.",5
"I love the smell and feel of this green tea cleanser.  It's a scrub but not harsh.  Great for sensitive skin and I've notice it not only helps with acne, but also calm my mild case of rosacea.  The bottle is a good size and lasts for a few months.",5
"I was so happy to find these, I have a Galla ball i need to put about 50 eyelashes on clients for... The worest thing ever...My happeness went away very quickly.. in the box look AMAZING trying to put on not so much. I am fashion stylist/beauty school owner. I put fake lashes on each day. I couldnt get these thing to bend at all. Lashes must shape the eye.. please save your money.. to the makers keep working on it.",1
"I have stick straight, black Asian hair and was skeptical whether or not this would work or be too harsh, but it worked and looks great!PROS- I left it in my hair for 25 min and rinsed it out.  It is VERY subtle, I recommend leaving it in more for a bolder look.- Hair does not appear damaged, but then again I did not leave it in very long- Other people have complimented me on the new highlights and said it looks good- The end color is really beautiful and goldenCONS- You have to put A LOT of it in your hair (especially if you have long hair).  My problem is that I thought I had enough in, but I didn't.- It's a little challenging to apply evenly and get the back hairs in.  In my case, only the front portions changed colorI would recommend this and buy it again!",4
"It's already been pointed out that this product works just as well for adults and maybe has some benefits.  I'll add to that by mentioning that it's especially good for senior citizens.  The lack of many chemicals present in regular shampoo is a plus, and the fact that these ""kids"" products are less threatening to the eyes is a great big plus for us old folks.  The scent  is definitely okay and not all that strong.  So hey, this is a fine product for your kids but also for ""grandpa"".",5
"This is a lovely, smooth mascara. There are no clumps, either on the brush or on your lashes, so you don't have to waste mascara by cleaning the brush before using it. The color is very nice, and gives a natural effect.The ingredients are healthy and natural. The mascara washes off easily, and doesn't smudge or give you those panda eyes (ladies, you all know what I mean). I have never had trouble with sensitivities to eye makeup, so I can't speak to that, but I notice that other reviewers have been happy with this aspect of the product.So, yes, it's good mascara. My favorite thing about this product, though, is the mirrored case. We see these usually for lipstick, which requires touchups during the day. But there are those days when we run out of the house without doing our eyes and then regret it later, and those days when we go straight from the gym to work -- not to mention traveling light for weekend trips. Drop a tube in your purse, and you'll be ready for anything.",5
"I received this product free of charge as part of SalonGuys' Market Research Program and do state that I wasn't expecting this spray bottle to be anything spectacular. A spray bottle can't be anything more than just precisely that, right? Not quite... Not when it comes to do with this fine bling of a product anyway...First off, the feel of the bottle is very fancy! It's super velvety and goes very well with the bling theme - richly smooth and pleasant to hold with a guaranteed firm grip as you spritz your hair away to superstardom. I really enjoy the feel and noticed that the bottle is made out of a plastic material that could be squeezed accordingly. I appreciate how the nozzle head could be turned 360 degrees to your convenience but most importantly, LOVE the misty quality of the water sprayed!I use a hair detangler formula from Victoria's Secret that comes in a spray bottle and thought that the spray it emits is of nice quality, but after using this bottle I've come to realize that it's the ultimate Spray Bottle Bling Queen. Not only does this bottle spray quite effortlessly, but the range of one single spray is impressive! What I find most important is that the hair is not drenched given its delicately light mist. Never did I think that there could be such stark differences amongst spray bottles...All in all, I highly recommend this spray bottle, for just one spray goes a really long way. This would be super important in cases where you would want to maximize the effects and prolong the duration of liquid hair formulas that might be a bit on the costly side. As one reviewer commented, this bottle may indeed be on the expensive side, but in the long run it would be more on the cost effective side when one thinks of how long their liquid hair formulas would last (or even water, if that would be an issue for some...).",5
"I have very oily scalp,so I use it on daily basis. Works good for me. I combine it with SuperPlump Conditioner and it does give me volumizing effect.",4
Water Field is a must have color that is great for layering over other colors or using by itself for a french manicure.,5
"I have very difficult curly-frizzy hair and this stuff really helped to calm down the frizz while not taking away my volume.  It was the only product I had to use after washing my hair to get great results and it left my hair feeling really soft all day.  For best results I would pat dry my hair with a towel after washing, then scrunch my hair with the product and either blow dry with a diffuser or let air dry--my best results were with air drying.  I also found that I could go easier without washing for a couple of days when I used this stuff too and very rarely on those days did I have to put more in to finish the look, I seriously would just kind of get up and go. Can't argue with the price either...and I looked in Wal-Mart for this stuff on my last grocery shopping trip and I don't know about your stores, but the one I went to did not have it so I will be ordering mine from amazon only I guess :)",5
"No aroma, excellent price. Will be mixing this in our own mixture of Shea Butter, Almond Oil and Almond Extract. We like the oil to make the Shea Butter melt faster, give a smoother flow and give off a pleasant sweet almond aroma. We have bought the Shea Butter in prepackaged 7 ounce sizes but figured this would work as well and give us a definitely, less costly product with good coverage for 3 plus months longer use.I have done this before with a moisturizing lotion (about 10 years ago) that all my friends just loved. It was made for a Christmas gift and they kept asking me to make it again, so, maybe this will please them now, and, again at Christmas. We shall see . . .",4
I purchased this cream because my skin would not stop peeling. I live in Texas and it is always so dry. I use this cream every night before bed and it decreased the peeling. I also like to use it on my hands before bed. Normal hand lotions will break out my face if I touch it while sleeping. I'm looking into purchasing more products from this line. The eye cream has fabulous reviews on Sephora.,4
It smelled like your grandparents retirement home nasty musk mixed with moth balls! but holy crap on a cracker you will be DARK!!!!!!!!!,3
This is the best lotion to make your hands feel silky smooth!  Ever since I had a manicure and she used these on my hands I have been in love!  I highly recommend it!,5
Had to see many YouTube videos to use it right way but still not perfect.I would say just gets your nails done from a professional....useless trying yourself,3
After a long time waiting for the product :/ I took contact with the seller :)the product was missing :( he answer the next day and I got another one ship to my place :) Very happy with that :)The new pencils arrive in good condition :) They look like they are made from a chip chip plastic :( but the pencil work well:) I have to wait son more weeks to see if they are still working good :)But not complain since the price was just 3 dollars :),5
I am giving this to my daughter.. its way to fruity/ teenager like for me. it smells great - just not for me.,4
I fits in my Louis Vuitton cosmetic case.  I can take it on the airplane to exotic places and smell good.  I can carry it to work and introduce other people to this romantic fragrance.,4
This stuff works good so far. I've had my nails on a couple days. I haven't did lengthy nails yet. Easy to apply. I will be ordering this again. Glad I ordered two containers.,5
"This sun screen's best features are its smell, and its non greasy feel. We've only had a few occasions to use this, but we have tried it while mowing and at the pool. Generally we're  out for a couple of hours at a time. I usually burn very easily, but haven't so far this year. I've tried this one and the Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate, and they're both great. Nice smell, and non greasy.  I can easily recommend this product.",4
I use this daily now & can tell a difference on my under eye circles. The cooling sensation is nice & it blends really easily.,4
"I haven't used a curling iron since I was in high school and had a ""spiral curler"". Luckily, the technology has come a long way. This wand heads up quickly and imparts a smoothness to my hair that is impressive. The only downside is that I missed the clip. There is a glove included, but I know it will probably get separated and who wants to search for it early in the morning or before a big evening? Also, with the 1 1/2"" model, it is kind of hard to wrap the hair around-I actually felt my hair was almost too short for this model. My hair is down my back and it was hard to wrap it around. This probably will not work for shorter hair.",3
"I was looking for something that didn't smell nasty like the spray can types. I ran across this on Amazon and the reviews made it seem like it was the lotion I was looking for. It works great, easy to apply, and most of all, little to no nasty smell. It actually doesn't have that &#34;greasy&#34; look like most sunscreens leave on your skin which was another bonus for me.This tube is a bit pricey, after I found the exact same thing at walgreens, the generic version for half the price. So I ended up buying 2 tubes for the price of 1 of Neutrogenia for the exact same things. It had the same ingredients in it and smells almost the same, but at half the price. So if you want to save money, I would try the walgreens generic version of this......it even says &#34;compare to Neutrogena ingredients&#34; on the bottle.So far, my skin hasn't been sensitive to this product as many end up experiencing symptoms like burning or irritation. I suggest getting the walgreens version of this before you spend the full price on the Name brand one.",4
"When i first purchased I was so sure what I was going to do with these but now after several months late, I have yet to use these.",3
My husband bought these because the reviews said they worked just as good as Gillette Sensor ones.  They do not.  Unfortunately he now has 24 blades to use.,1
This product has a classic Irish Spring smell with a sweet twist. It is probably the most feminine smell of all their scents. It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. I love the liquid soaps you get clean without drying out your skin. I really liked using this one on my face. The little exfoliating beads helped to give my face a nice glow. I think it would make a great addition to anyone's daily cleansing routine.,5
This brush is great for my extensions and also for my natural hair.  It reduces static cling which my natural hair has very badly.,5
"I purchased this iron at CVS to try it out.  It is a little difficult to hold your hair in place on the barrel.  I ended up not using the included glove because it made it difficult to hold onto my hair. I did like how the curls came out.  You just need to gather small amounts of hair and separate your hair into sections to make it easier.  The curls came out really tight which I wanted and lasted for the whole night with some light hairspray of course.  Keeping the ends of your hair in place it difficult at first but with some practice it will get easier.  I ended up returning it at CVS since they charged me $43, yes that much.  Their mark ups are ridiculous so I ordered it on Amazon for a little over half the price, so worth returning it.",4
X x x does what it should. X x x x x x x x x x x x d,4
"Great quality product.  The bottles are midsized not the tiniest bon bon size you can get.  I suppose if you have very large talons they might only be good for one use.  However, I have kid-friendly nails and have used the green polish several times and still have plenty in the bottle.  You will need a base and top coat as the colors are a typical (for neon) semi matte.  I think the colors are called Neon Night Life because they are all good colors for a night at the club under the neon lights.  Not because they are all neon.  Either way, I could see the colors before I placed the order so I am very satisfied.  I got what I ordered.",5
"I love the skin obsession TCA 15% peel. This peel is great if you're a beginner. I have been to spas and recieved chemical peels costing hundreds of dollars. This peel gives you the exact results, you will absolutely LOVE the results! Remember to follow instructions and this is a great start for new at home chemical skin peelers.  I have purchased the TCA 30% because I would like a deeper peel. I will post results soon....",5
Love this stuff goes on very well makes my lashes look full with out clumping I will b getting more of this it is we'll worth the price great deal came fast,5
"Helps eliminate frizz but keep the curl, and adds a little shine.  Use sparingly!  It's a good bargain for $5.00 as a little will go a long way.",3
"My skin normally gets very dry in the winter, especially on my face. I'm not a huge fan of salt or sugar scrubs because they're often oil based and leave a film on my skin. I have only used this product three times so far, and I can't begin to describe how amazing it is. I can use it anytime without suffering any irritation, my dry skin is completely gone, and I feel like it helps my lotion sink in better as well. Gentle enough to use every day but effective enough that I don't have to. Will definitely repurchase when I finally run out. This is the only product that has been able to make such a difference and especially in such a short amount of time, I am completely sold!",5
"I'm a RN. Nurses was their hands a lot. Not like normal people wash their hands a lot, but like a lot a lot. So when my hands were scaly and starting to resemble a cheap street knockoff alligator purse, I borrowed a squirt of this from a coworker. It couldn't have been more magical if unicorns and sparkles emerged from the pump. Not only did it smell lovely and hopefully cover a little of the smell of sweat and various bodily fluids that were no doubt on my scrubs, but it made my hands look totally not like a cold reptilian handbag. My hubby is hooked too. Buy it.",5
this product is way overpriced and it doesn't even work that great. It did nothing extra for my hair...save your money and buy something better that will give you more product for your dollar,3
Not greasy at all.  My face loved it but my neck found it too strong and developed an itchy rash at the base of one side between the collar bone and the top of the shoulder and up the neck a bit.  It went away when I stopped using the cream and came back when I started again.  So I used it up on my face and moved to a different cream so that I didn't have to keep two kinds of cream going.,4
"I am Native American with light medium skin. When I Suntan,I turn medium to dark brown. I used the Jergens BB cream for medium skin tones, and it really made my skin feels so soft.This cream has a pinky beige hue that makes it look like Foundation. The color does not dye your skin, but it does give your skin a slightly Rosie glow.  It is good for several different skin types, but it does have a strong musky scent that may interfere with your other body products.  The smell reminds me of Obsession perfume.My daughter loves it,because she does not have to wear perfume when she uses this cream.I on the other hand, do not like the strong sense. I put it on my hand and it felt nice and soft and smell okay, but when I rubbed it from my elbows down on both arms with sent was so overwhelming I became nauseous. So if you are affected by strong scents, this is not for you.My sister also loves the scent.*warning. Do not use on broken skin, irritated skin, are open skin areas. I accidentally got this on an examole irritated place and it burned a lot.",3
Ok-I have been waxed once before and it was so bad I swore to never do it again (my friend was becoming an esthetician and I was her first time). I saw all of the reviews and I thought- what the heck maybe I can do this too. It was actually very easy to use and not nearly as painful as when my friend did it. There were some points where it was a bit painful but I bet it was my own fault. It actually did not last me as well as it did some other reviewers. I used almost the whole jar and I only cleaned half up. Maybe I used too much wax? Either way it turned out great. It's nice and clean- which is what I wanted. The only other thing that bothered me is how the wax piles up on the rim of the jar. It was frustrating. I also had to reheat it about 3 times. I might get the mug warmer. Other than those 2 things- I'm a happy camper=),4
Doesn't work your client has to keep switching hands. It takes forever for the coats to dry. The thinnest coats mind you. Spend a little more and get a better product. I don't even use this anymore.,1
"This soap is okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.  The package tells you that it makes you feel clean. I don't want to just feel clean, I want to be clean. The bar didn't lather well, and the scent is pleasant but does not last on the skin.  Overall, in my opinion, there is nothing special here.  The scent doesn't last, the lather is minimal, and without getting to personal, I'm not sure I'm as clean as I want to be. I feel that if I am going to purchase a specialty soap with a strong scent, I would like the scent to linger on the skin - this doesn't linger at all.  If a person is looking for a nicely scented soap that does a good job getting you clean, this doesn't quite make the grade for me.",3
This is a quality hairbrush at a reasonable price.  It works well on my medium thick hair.  Highly recommend this.,5
"As soon as I put on this creme, it tingled my face. It hasn't stung my eyes yet. It is very light and absorbs well. I sense no oiliness.",4
"Like I've said in other reviews, I have long been a fan of the Babyganics line. My daughter has my sensitive skin and this line does not irritate her skin like a lot of other baby targeted brands.This particular product is a small stick of sunscreen.  Think like a mini deodorant. It goes on easily, doesn't have a scent (that I noticed) and like most baby sunscreens leaves a white residue until it is fully rubbed in.I personally like how small this is, and find that with a toddler the sunscreen sticks + wipes work easiest and allow me the ability to see if I've missed any spots.My daughter did not have any issues or allergic reactions to this sunscreen. Great item for purses and travel bags!",5
"Right when I got this, I didn't want to put it anywhere near my eyelids to be honest. The seller is great though. But the curler is flimsy and cheap and stickyish. My sister asked if she could have it and I didn't hesitiate to say yes! Just gave it two stars though because it curls somewhat, but shipping was too long, even for hong kong, it was flimsy and cheap looking almost as if it would break any second, and it was somewhat sticky. I would suggest going to a local Target and getting a E.L.F. eyelash curler for only one dollar! It works great and by a trusted brand.",2
"I would've given this product four stars, however, when you pay for 2 day shipping, that's what you come to expect. Product is so-so. I saw gradual increase in bronzing. I have not gone more than a couple times so I do not know if it can give you the ultimate golden glow. We'll see.Apart from the shipping, This product does make you darker and leaves you with a alright after tanning smell. Not putrid like some other tanners. Doesn't tan the fastest, but gets you there if you keep going, just like all tanners. This was a great price as compared to the in store tanning prices that are RIDIC!",2
"bought for my mom to give to her with the station. works great. not too much comes out at once so little kids, like my nephews, don't waste the soap. I will take the one persons advice and drill a hole into one or both of them and refill with other liquid soaps. ty!",5
"Like tha picture BUT the mascara its bad, i hate it ( El rimel no funciona bien, no suben las pesta&ntilde;as con el muy desepcionada )",2
"I think this vitamin c serum is wonderful, after two weeks of use, I could see and feel the difference in my skin.ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!",5
"I like the color of this glaze because it can be worn alone and is neutral enough that it can be worn over almost any shade of lipstick without changing the color.  Just adds a nice shine.  Not sure that it actually &#34;plumps&#34; your lips, but it does feel warm and tingly when applied.",4
"I was doubtful when I read how everyone loved this stuff.  I'm very pale naturally.  While this went on &#34;dark&#34; after it's rubbed in, it looks great and overnight it leaves a natural looking &#34;tan&#34;.  It's the best one I've used.",5
"I just came home from two weeks of beachy goodness - which unfortunately gave my hair a workout.  It's a dry, frizzy mess!  I seriously thought iI was going to have to do a big chop to get it looking decent again. I was also worried this leave-in would weigh my hair firm or worse, make it look greasy like I hadn't washed the conditioner out of my hair like so many others do.At first, it felt kinda gross - sticky and nasty (I tried it on clean but dry hair) but after a minute or so, it made my hair SUPER bouncy, thick and shiny looking.  I'm sold on this stuff.  The scent is a bonus -fresh, clean, yummy.  And the pot size is a good value.  Totally worth it for how great my hair looks now.",5
"Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and femenine cologne",5
"I can actually get stuff done righ after doing my nails! I don't have to weight minutes for my nail polish to dry, this top coat dries fast and leaves a beautiful shine. The smell is the only thing that bothers me, is a bit too strong.",5
"I've converted to Moroccan oil as a general everyday full body moisturizer. My skin feels amazingly soft after application. I love how I can apply to face and not break out. My skin feels smooth. Noticeable difference after even a single application. Non-sticky. Don't feel oily. Easy to spread. Absorbs right in. Use it as a stretch mark prevention on my pregnant abdomen.Comes in a 2 oz plastic bottle, which I've used argan oil in nice fancy glass bottles too. The quality of the oil is comparable, but the glass does make it feel of higher quality for storage. I suppose plastic would be convenient for travels and less risk of breakage.  Pump that is easy to use.",4
"It's a good fragrance and smells good, but I don't think I'll purchase it again. The price is good, but I'd rather go with Lucky, Mambo, Guess or several other fragrances for the same price.",3
Nothing like the real thing...I've tried a few imitation beauty blending sponges and this was by far one of the worst unfortunately. The material is too firm and ruff and doesn't get bigger when dampened like the original.,1
"i found a yes to carrots face wash three years ago at an ulta in savannah ga and have never forgotten it. i have used salon hair products for the last ten years but recently i have been looking not only how my products effect my hair but also how they affect the environment and animals. aveda is a great company that only uses plant products but they get expensive after a while. so to break up the dent in my wallet, i bought this and its matching shampoo.let me tell you, i am in love! it smells great, leaves my hair soft and tangle free. i am super glad i got this and will get it on a regular basis. i am happy that it is crulety free and uses organi ingredients. such a good buy.",5
"I have looked at several YOUTUBE videos and saw people using these sponges. I wondered..&#34;What's the big deal with this sponge?&#34; Well, I orderd these and I now see. These are great for blending. I was going to purchase the actual &#34;Beauty Blender&#34; sponge, however, it was not necessary to spend the extra money to get one sponge. Here, I got 4 and they are really good. My only problem is that they are kinda tough to clean. This is why I give it 4 stars. I had to keep squeezing and rinsing it to rid  it of the soap I used. So I recommend using VERY little soap to  clean it. After all it is a sponge. I think these work well, and  if you are on the fence, go ahead and try them. You will be pleasantly surprised. Also, go to YOUTUBE and you can see how to use it!",4
"A few years ago, a long side to side study of all the popular face creams was done. Price was not an indicator of quality.  In fact, the super expensive ones (like La Prairie) did not fare as well as Olay. (Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream I believe was the winner).I do not recall how the L'Oreal products fared or whether or not they were even tested.Clearly, this is true in this case.  This cream is certainly a good addition to your daily routine.Agree-  if you've done a good job of taking care off your skin for years, avoided excessive sun exposure (wearing SPF around 45 on your face), refrained from smoking, excessive drinking and high Salt intake, you should be feeling pretty good about your skin in general today. Skin care is not a flash in the pan.  Your face shows years of your routine.Most importantly, avoid the harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA primarily) on your face.  Keep your skin hydrated and use a well balanced nourishing cream that helps you lock in moisture without adding grease or being comedogenic (causing pimples).If your facial skin care is to the contrary, this cream is NOT a substitute for derm-abrasion or plastic surgery.What this cream is:  a nicely balanced, non-greasy facial cream, suitable for both day and night use.Appreciate that it is nicely affordable as well.  (Especially on sale).",5
"I've tried many beauty products that don't ""deliver""; this is not one of them.  Results are striking and evident even faster than promised.",5
"I had ordered a belly oil from another company at the beginning of my pregnancy, but was never able to stomach the smell of it, so I went in search of another one.I had first tried out Belli's skincare line, since it was the only one I could find that was deemed pregnancy-safe, and I've been very happy with it, so I decided to try this belly oil next.It is now my favorite thing I own from Belli. I'm completely addicted to the scent. It is so relaxing and perfect for bedtime! Time will tell if it helps with the stretch marks but so far so good!",5
My hair was like a yellow and brassy color. I used this and wow a beautiful blonde.thanks Amazon.. I am so glad a chanced this color.,5
"Tresemme Smooth and Silky Conditioner, 32 Ounce is a very nice conditioner for all types of hair,especially nice to get this on a subscription.",5
I was disappointed after all of the good reviews I read. I just didn't find that this made any difference in my hair at all.,2
"When I first orderd this, I also bought several other hair accessory clips and peices from other chinesse companies. I was expecting this heart piece to be one of my least fave but I was wrong. Its sooo much pretier in person. Shines well. Its an ""aligator clip""  which is awesome and hold up in my thick kinky hair very well",5
"I order this for my daughter and I know it took an long time to come but when I gotten it, it was broken. When I contacted seller they asked me to take a picture to send another one but I didn't just cuz I knew how long it takes to come!",1
"My doc recommends this line.. and I have to tell you I can see why.  It is the best over the counter cream I can remember using.. affordable and lightweight but heavy enough to solve the issue.. NO smell and RELIEF from itch, dryness and being uncomforable.. it is a wonderful product, but I have never used anything in their line i didn't love.",5
Great for shining hair and smooth skin.  All natural and long lasting.  I recommend this brand of natural oil for hair and skin.,5
"At first I wasn't too sure about it, but after using it for about 2 and a half weeks, my sister who had not seen me for a month noticed that my lashes were fuller and thicker.  I am also using it on my eyebrows, and they also got darker too! Its good for the price! oh, and it is good for sensitive eyes too.",4
ok not a great product I really did not see any difference. I think these products are a waste of time and money. There are much better products out there that really help to thicken your eyelashes as well as soften the lines around your eyes.,3
"Like all adidas eau de toilette's it smells great; however the draw back is that it's staying power is terrible, which is to be expected since it's and eau de toilette and not parfume, but still, even to that end it's staying power is weak.",4
"Flamed Out mascara with the &#34;Volume Igniter brush&#34; is &#34;specially designed to add volume to EVERY lash for bigger, thicker, and fuller lashes to help maximize volume&#34; (according to packaging). The casing feels very light, and honestly very cheap to me. That may not be a big deal to some people, but when the casing is so light, it throws off the balance of my hand in applying the mascara. The brush covers my lashes well, but I did have to use two coats (as in, apply one coat, for it to dry, then apply a second coat) for full coverage. When I took off my makeup though, I noticed that the mascara had flaked everywhere and it was flaky coming off. Not really a pleasant experience.If you're looking for a similar type of mascara brush, my recommendation is Rimmel's Scandal Eyes mascara. It has a bit heavier of casing, and covers each lash much better.",3
"I love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes.  I'm almost complete with the full set of these brushes, they have the best brushes for the best price - to me better than MAC",5
"This daily exfoliating cleanser in my opinion rivals my more expensive exfoliator by Elizabeth Arden.The first time I used this product I put about a quarter size dollop in my palm, mixed it a little bit with water and stirred it around in my hand before putting it on my face. oooooo, really creamy and a nice amount of grit, not like most cleansers and when i moved it around on my face I was amazed how nice it feels and makes my skin feel with the least amount of grit.So, next time I use it I put about a nickel size amount in my hand and still loads more than I would use. I'm down to a dime size now and I believe that is the correct amount from me.  I can't describe how yummy the cream exfoliator feels. It doesn't make my skin feel violated like most scrubs do.  Its almost like they put it in cream instead of a soap base.The rinse from my face is more of a joy.  Yes, it came off easily.  I did rinse twice as I normally do and all of it came off which was a complete shock.  No grit beside my nose or in my eyebrows as my other exfoliator does.  I do follow with a mild astringent but I really didn't need to.  My face was a little rosy as I like it after a really good cleanse.This product was a joy to use and I will look at the Ponds brand more closely for other products I might be interested in at a reasonable price.",5
"This smells like black licorice, which, I don't like eating but I don't mind the smell. It was okay, nothing really special. It slightly made my hair softer than anything I've used before but I think it's overpriced and far too overrated.",3
"I love this product.  The weight , the size are great for travel.  I have a short style so don't need muchpower, although this would work for anyone.  I liked so well I now have one in my guest bathroom.",5
"It does what it says on the cover.  Wide toothed, gentle on hair, arrived on time.  Highly recommended for 4b hair like my own.",5
"I purchased this coconut oil from a local India market here n town for $2.99. This coconut oil has a pleasant lemony smell and is easily absorbed. It makes my hair soft, silky, and smooth. This is my number one hair oil that I keep at all times in my home. It is a must have for all hair types, especially for those like myself who have tight curls. By the way, any price over $4.50 is too much for this oil as it can be found at most any India grocers or International markets.",5
I was really skeptical about purchasing this item coz i've always used very high priced department store brands. This one i'll have to say is almost similar to the Lamer serum. I've been using it for only 2 weeks now and there's noticable difference in the glow of my skin. I use it aloing with the regenerist daily moisturizer with spf. This product does a great job and i guess i'll never be looking back at the big brands.,5
"This lotion was not what I expected.  It was thicker and oilier than I thought it would be, and the scent was not appealing to me- smells a little too plastic. Still, with it being winter, I thought it would keep my newborn's skin soft and moisturized.Alas, after application, she broke out in a red rash. Tried it again after a few days passed to confirm it was this lotion.Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns program and I was able to return for a full refund.Bought &#34;Noodle and Boo Super Soft Lotion&#34; and love it.",1
I've always loved this stuff but it has been a while since I've used it. I will definitely purchase this product again.,5
"I have curly 3a hair that is difficult and full of frizz.  This shampoo actually created more frizz and has some chemicals I worry about, and it suds for no apparent reason.  It left my hair with considerable slip when wet, which felt promising but as the day progressed, my hair felt more dry than it had in weeks and I actually had to use a mist and more gel (something I never had to do in the past with other co-wash) just to keep down the Rosanna-Rosanna-Dana look from stalking me.I didn't particularly like the smell either, and it did not get better during the day.  It has a heavily chemical scent to it and the hibiscus scent seems to sour a bit. My husband definitely didn't sleep closer to me that night. I think it's a good first try, but L'Oreal could do better and eliminate some of the more drying (and silicone based) chemicals from their line for us Curly girls. Also, one of the chemicals seemed to make my head break out in painful zits that took a few days to clear. I had higher hopes when I got out of the shower because of the feel of the slip, but they faded fast when the scent became sour and my curly ran skyward to escape it. It might work for type 2 a little better, but even 2c's might find it super drying and frizz inducing.",2
"I ordered this for my boys to have in their bathroom. I was tired of taking them to my bathroom and using the big hair dryer on them. Now I can just whip this little travel one out to dry their short hair. Perfect timing for winter when the bathroom is colder than usual. Very powerful, light weight and compact.",5
"I received this item in exchange for a review on my blog and on Amzaon.com.I like the pump on the bottle because it helps prevent bacterial contamination. The acid serum absorbed quickly into my skin, and I believe that it has helped reduce the appearance of fine lines on my face. I will need to use hylauronic acid longer for better results. I like that the acid is made from organic products and is safe for my sensitive skin.You can read my full review here: http://costaricanflora.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-to-take-care-of-your-skin-during.html",4

"I like to do my nails a lot and for the more complex nail designs, I often use Konad templates. Prior to this, I had the normal stamp which was very wide which made it more difficult to do precise stamping. This double ended stamper definitely fixed that problem.",5
Seems fine on light skin that is lightly tanned. If you do not scrub your skin well it will create blotches that are darker than others area's and be obvious. Goes on easy with decent smell.,4
I purchased this item for fresh 1st and 2nd degree burns that I acquired a few months back.  They are on my right arm and right leg in visible areas so I really wanted to get rid of the scarring before it is too late.  I am done with the large size bottle and there is absolutely no difference in the scarring.  I followed instructions and used it twice a day but I can't report any progress.  I wish this oil worked but unfortunately I am stuck with the scars until I can find something that I will fade it over time.,1
it is not at all what is in the pic u have to use a black or white fake nails or polish..,3
"I ordered this after all the good reviews on amazon.  That is why I love amazon I can usually make a very informed choice before I purchase something.  This scrubby towel is great.  Especially if you have ketoris pelosis or however you spell that, little bumps on your arms possibly legs.  My kids and I have it and this really helps scrub it away.  I feel very clean after a shower.",5
I use this product on my face every day. I love the Image skin care line and especially love this. A little dab will do ya!,5
"Use these flat pearls for craft projects.  They are about 3mm in size.  On the downside, the wheel is hard to turn and if not careful there will be pearls ALL OVER!",4
I bought these on a whim after being pleasantly surprised by other RoC products.  They really have a nice skin care line.  These work well and are relatively inexpensive compared to similar products.  My only complaint is they should offer refill packs of 60 or 100 so the packaging isn't wasted.  I like the way the jar opens with a flip top lid to avoid fumbling around with wet hands.  The product gives you a nice clean face without making your face feel tight.  I will continue to purchase.,4

"Now, THIS is the STUFF!  Forget anything else out there ladies, this one will do the trick!  I am going to have to buy more soon, though, as it's such a small bottle but it really does a wonder job on your face!  Love this stuff!  Just wish they would give me more for my money!",5
"If you are ever running low on soap this is the thing for you.  Just pop open the top and squeeze some into your empty dispenser.  Voila, you now have more soap!  Seriously, though, it's a reasonable price for a big bottle of soap.",4
"Being a wee bit on the pale side (seriously if I don't hear the words 'you look a bit pale' at least once a week...), sunscreen is a must. Hawaiian Tropic Silk goes on very easily, absorbing quickly and leaving the skin feeling nice and silky (as advertised) without any sticky or greasy residue.  There's a definite coconuty/flowery scent when you put it on, but it does fade away a bit (guys may be happy to hear that).  The sunscreen holds up decently to normal conditions - the biggest selling point to this lotion is that it does leave your skin feeling great while protecting it.  The faint fragrance is an added bonus, unless that's something you'd rather avoid (due to allergies/sensitivities or preferring not to smell vaguely like flowers and coconuts).",5
"I use this cleanser and tend to recommend it.I have used many,many fancy and store bought brands and the Neutrogena CPM seems to help keep my break outs to a minimum. I am not saying it is the best, but I know two other good friends who see the same results I do. It just works for us. Unfortunately stress, diet and hormones have a significant affect on my acne, which can be anything from mild to severe.Basically, if I use this in conjunction with a very mild cleanser my skin looks clear. I have also noticed, if I wash in circles for 30 sec to a full minute and rinse well, my skin looks very clean and almost radiant. And it feels soft from the tiny, tiny exfoliation beads.The mask is too drying, but as a cleanser, I prefer it to proactiv. And frankly the acne market is worth billions, so I tend to use affordable products if I can, that work.EDIT: October 2012I had to stop using this product. My skin is older and more sensitive and prefers natural cleansers. I will use this maybe, once a month or after a long hot summer day. But sadly, it dries me out horribly now and irritates my skin which it never used to. I have heard some people say you can develop sensitivity to b peroxide. It is a very hash chemical, so that makes sense.",4
This has definitely become a part of my daily morning regiment........After a bad bout with adult acne I have been trying everything to get my face to feel normal again.............I like the way this feels and I will be purchasing more,5
"The brushes overall are good quality. I rate the eye brushes 5 stars b/c they work great for applying cream or powder eyeshadow and have not had a problem with any of them. The powder brush, however, have been acting up recently. My powder brush handle broke off last week and it began shedding after one wash. Nothing some crazy glue can't fix, but it's still inconvenient. Other than that, these brushes I believe are definitely worth the price, especially if you're a beginner at make-up like me.",4
"Right now I'm suffering with hives on my face resulting from a bug bite.  The welts are quite red, so I thought I would try this to suppress their appearance.  It does a nice job of toning it down, and like another reviewer commented, this would work well under your foundation.  I like the design of the glass bottle, and the dispenser spits out just the right amount.  The lotion is very mild and causes no irritation, which I was skeptical about.  Some complain about the green being visible, and I really can't say that was my experience.  This lotion also has a SPF 15.",4
"Normally when you open a new polish you assume it's going to smell a certain way, and that the texture will be smooth and not too thin. Well, this one was a bit old I think. It has a thicker texture than normal, but it's alright, I'm not too picky.",3
"I quote:  ""This creamy natural body wash is infused with jojoba beads, so it exfoliates while you cleanse.""Infused? Really? Uhh, No.At first I thought the beads might have settled to the bottle while sitting on the shelf or something, so I kept shaking it and even had it sitting upside down ready for my next shower.But really it turns out that they only put about 5 jojoba beads in each bottle. Which is wierd because Burts usually does a really good job on thier products. There really is not any exfoliating going on here unless you are squeezing it out onto a loofah and washing with it that way. Which is what I am doing now. The milky base for the body wash is ok. So with the loofah it will still be worth using the rest of the bottle. But even then the wash almost smells a bit too perfumy for a natural based product, otherwise I might have given it at least 3 stars.The irony is that the small polished jojoba beads would have been perfect for their Willow Bark face scrub which, unfortunatly is the only only other Burt's Bees product that I have been disenchanted with on account of the overly harsh and sharp Peach Stone bits that would have been much better suited for this body product!",2
"Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is the very best conditioner I have ever used.  It is perfect for my fine thin hair.  It is not too heavy and not greasy, leaves my hair shiny and full of bounce.",5
I'm a tough critic when it comes to fragrances. I'm SO tired of celebrities selling new scents just to make money. BUT WOW...HALLE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING! This is soooooo beautiful. It's warm and exotic. It's definitely a sensual fragrance and makes me feel great. I just wish the 3 piece set was available now.,5
"I initially bought Liggett bar shampoo due to my extensive travels.. and wouldn't you know it, I'm no longer traveling, either. I am still on the fence for daily use or for general traveling. For my former very extensive Road Warrior travels, this is a 5 star product without a doubt!  (Those who have done PDAs with For Ever Moving Around will understand...)Traveling:* lightweight and convenient - this 3.5 oz bar claims to replace a 24 oz bottle of shampoo.* TSA - need I say more?* no worries of shampoo spills in luggage - been there, done that! (Always wrap any bottle(s) in a sturdy ziplock!)* my concerns are getting the bar shampoo dry enough in the rushed morning repacking when hotel hopping night after night (federal government - don't ask, don't tell LOL!)  I think I would dedicate a soft but thick cloth to wrap around this bar to allow some air flow so it doesn't turn into a soggy lump in a ziplock. It simply needs to breathe.. without coming into contact with my clothes. (Any of you new FEMITES doing preliminary damage assessments- make extra note of this...)Everyday use:* it didn't leave my hair straw dry as some shampoos... or oily... or greasy... but I don't know.. I don't think I am used to it yet.* I was concerned it would dry out in the shower - or turn into a soggy blob. So far so good, it's still very similar to how it arrived over 6 months ago (I obviously haven't used it much- I fell in love with 365 Herbal Mint Shampoo.Ingredients:  olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, spring water, sodium hydroxide (lye), essential oils for fragrance.For backpacking or *extensive* travels requiring extremely light packing, this is a 5 star product. For most anyone else....",4
"Yes, I was skeptical and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is due to the outrageous price. The fig was GREAT on my hair. Can't believe someone didn't like it. I received it as a combo deal with the conditioner/cleaner, and just let it sit for a long time in a cabinet. What was I thinking?! I'm running out now and decided on getting the almond. I hope it's as good as the fig. My head feels and smells like I've washed my hair. I've even gone 2 days only using this stuff. Well anyway, I'm buying more of this expensive product, so I can attest that it is the bomb diggity. :)",4
"Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner is as good as the shampoo by the same name. I ordered the 2 ounce size of this one, too, and this is eligible for Prime shipping, unlike the shampoo.  It leaves hair soft and with no tangles, but not limp.  I have color on my hair, and some hair products strip the color, but this doesn't.  The ingredients listed are almost all natural and as with the shampoo, there are no animal by-products in it and it is cruelty-free, which is important to me.I most definitely recommend this for anyone who wants soft, shiny hair.",5
"Tinted moisturizers are generally not my thing.  I find that most of the ones I've tried don't tend to hit the mark with either moisturizer or foundation.The Nars Pure Radiant Tinted moisturizer is definitely the exception.  This product is incredibly moisturizing and also has fantastic coverage.  Most brands do tinted moisturizers in a very limited color range, but the Nars tinted moisturizer comes in an astounding 9 shades.  This is fantastic if you're someone like me who has very fair skin.  With other brands, I often find that the lightest tinted moisturizer is way too dark.  But not Nars, their lightest shade, Finland works great on me.The level of SPF in the Nars tinted moisturizer is also great.  Most brands will top out at SPF 15 or 20, but this is SPF 30.I am incredibly happy with this product.  I find it wears well through out the day, is very moisturizing and has really good coverage.I will definitely repurchase.",5
"I purchased the tea tree scent directly from Dr. Bronner's website, and loved it so much I had to talk about it! I have tried a ton of organic lotions and body washes, this is my absolute favorite body wash of all time, although I also use the Dr Bronner's bar soap as well.  I have light, sensitive skin prone to breakouts.  I work out a lot, so I also break out along with it, on my chest, face and back.  I ordered this version on a whim, I really don't care for tea tree smell, at all.  But for these results, I could tolerate anything.I have a prescription cream to use on my breakouts, but it takes them days to heal, and peels, burns and bleaches the clothing it touches.  I have taken antibiotics, and those didn't do any good at all.  Anytime I heat up, I break out. Lovely.So, I tried the tea tree soap instead, ONE TIME, with my Clarisonic, and the next morning my breakouts were smaller, and many were almost gone. So today, I used it on my face, (which turns red with just about anything). My skin looks fantastic, and with no irritation. The blackheads on either side of my nose are gone. I have been trying to rid myself of those for a week, and it took one use of the tea tree soap! I know it sounds too good to be true, but this company is the real deal.  As I said, if you can just tolerate the tea tree smell, this body wash pays off big time! Tea tree oil has been used forever for it's antibacterial properties.  You can make an awesome foaming handsoap out of this; just save an old foaming handsoap container, fill it with 3/4 cup distilled water and 1/4 cup of any of the Dr. Bronner's castile soaps (the hemp almond is my favorite to use for handsoaps). I used to use triclosan soaps, but quit when I read about it's toxicity.  My hands were always dry and my nails peeling.  People, you really need to rid yourself of as many chemicals as you can, it makes a huge difference in the way you feel.  Sorry! Off the soapbox, and back to the review...This is such a fantastic company.  They present themselves as a family more than a company, and really do fill their products with organic and fair trade ingredients.  If you study them a bit more, they also give a ton of their profits away, and treat their employees like family.  (I wish I lived in California so I could go beg for a job there!)",5
"Brush is soft enough, and yet firm enough to contour as expected. I use this every day. Love it. Inexpensive.",5
"Im a deep golden caramel skin tone, and Apricot Kiss, was not the color for me...... And the pic shows that its lighter.... the blush is PINK.....",2
Love this stuff...I use it for my face and hair...A little bit goes a long way and whatever I use it for feels clean and energized once the process is done.,5
"I HEARD AT LOT OF TALK ABOUT THIS PRODUCT SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME. I HAD A LOT OF SHRINKAGE AND IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK DULL EVEN WITH ADDED OILS, SO I WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN AND IT WAS HARD TO DETANGLE. I THINK I WILL STAY WITH AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE DEEEP CONDITIONER,  MY HAIR  LOVES THIS STUFF, I HAVE VERY LITTLE SHRINKAGE ,VERY EASY TO DETANGLE ,LOTS OF SLIP, AND LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINY.",1
"I bought the NYX Eye Brow Shaper Wax to replace the much more expensive Anastasia brand that I ran out of.  This product is the exact same, at a better price.  I am really sold on NYX.  Haven't had a bad experience with their cosmetic products yet.",5
This stuff is horrible. Way to sticky. If it gets on your fingers it just has to wear off.Yuck,1
"This shampoo is OK, I can not say I noticed any real difference to my hair.  Fragrance is nice.  Easy tube to use in the shower.  OK product.",3
"The bottle itself is in shape and proportion like a slightly small tube of caulk.  That made me like it.  To me it was only a little strange &#34;opening&#34; it, because one presses one side of the top and the other side pops up just a little.  But that makes it great to close - just push the raised half of the top down and it clicks shut.This shampoo lathers well.  It rinses out nicely.  Hair truly feels soft afterwards.The fragrance is to me like tangerines.",5
"This powder where as well and is easy to apply. Personally I like to use a brush. It is awesome that you can find your TrueColor using this line. There are no guessing games, it is clearly listed on the compact what shaded is is either neutral cool or warm and what deepness it is. I give it four stars because the new packaging is annoying with the mirror on the back. If you use the mirror and the powder at the same time you constantly have to flip the compact over.",4
"To test & review this properly, I planned on using this until it disintegrated, but after a week of forcing myself to put up with the scent, I'd had enough. Yes, some people rave about the smell, but to me, it's just awful. And it sticks with you (I can smell it on my hands right now, 4 hours after using it). Of course, smell is relative, so I can't give this a poor review on that alone. I do, however, think it's fair to deduct one star because of the cloying & lingering fragrance chemicals used, and I'll base the rest of the review on the advertised claims vs my experiences.Overall, I found absolutely nothing special about this product. It hasn't made my skin look or feel any better than any other similar product I've used, and it costs roughly the same as what I normally use.Looking at their advertised claims:""Purifying grains clean deeper"" and ""Purifying exfoliants renew skin"" - nonsense (and poor grammar). It contains a small amount of tiny grains of salt. The amount of exfoliating & deep cleaning they can actually do is miniscule, especially when compared to using an exfoliating sponge, or loofa, etc.""Feels better than regular soap"" - a meaningless claim. Feels better how, and by whom, and how are they defining ""regular soap""?Speaking of ""soap,"" notice they never once call this ""soap."" They can't legally call this soap because it's not soap; it's a detergent. To be called ""soap,"" it has to be entirely comprised of natural ingredients, and since this ""Body and Face Bar"" is primarily synthetics (dyes, perfumes, chemicals, etc.), it's not soap, though they do use some natural ingredients, like sodium tallowate (rendered beef fat) and microcrystalline wax (petroleum refinery byproduct).""1/4 moisturizing cream"" - what does that even mean? 1/4 cup? Tablespoon? Milligram? It's not a typo; that's what it says in the ad blurb at the top, and it says the same thing in the Product Description, and the same thing on the product packaging, and the same thing on their website... And what's the moisturizing ingredient? Are they referring to the beef fat?After reading more about all of the listed ingredients, I decided I'll be throwing this bar of stink in the trash when I get home today.",1
"The creamy vanilla orchid scent smells as good (though definitely not as strong) as perfume.  Lysol's new touch of foam hand soap is great for the kitchen or bathroom, and since a small amount foams up in your hand, you don't use that much at once, so it lasts quite a while, saving money in your soap budget.  I'd like to try some of the others scents as well.",5
"I have to say I have tried half dozen of these creams over the last 6 months. For me all they really seem to do is soften my face, this cream is no different, maybe I am just not wrinkled enough. This has an odor the fades as it dries, it does make my skin soft and slightly plumped but that stops when you stop using the product, my wrinkles which for me are mostly laugh lines at the mouth show no difference in my opinion.",3
This product was recommended to me by a spa...extremely happy with it and price was great.,5
"These lipsticks are great.  They last a long time, and are super moisturizing.  I bought these lipsticks a year ago, and am still using up the last of the lipstick.  Most of these accentuated my face color, and I got a lot of compliments about my looks when I wore these lipsticks. :)  This is a smile for happiness about the product.  I love this product, and would buy lipstick from Shany again!",5
Great stocking stuffers.  Everyone loves using it because it is made so much better than the other brands and is very sharp.  The quality is worth the money.  How many cheap brands have you bought and they break and don't clip well?  Buy this one and you won't have that problem.,5
While the color is off from what I believe I had from the nail salon - I still like it very much and often get compliments on the color!,5
"I bought these for a two week trip to Europe.  They worked great, with no leaks, and enough product for one male for two weeks, with a little left over in each container.  Could have gone three weeks easy.  In them I had shampoo, conditioner, and face wash.  No problems at all.  Products used were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner, and dermalogica dermal clay.",5
"This shampoo smells fantastic, I like it as well as my husband. I would compare the smell to an axe or old spice variety shampoo that is almost like a cologne, it is pleasant and not overpowering. The intense part comes in with the sensation of the tingle, if you have a sensitive scalp or any sort of open scratch the sensation is overwhelming and can be unpleasant. After using this shampoo hair feels clean and the moisturizing seems to work well. We haven't had any problems with dandruff since starting to use this product.",4
"These cases are really small, but it does have good acrylic powder, but you will definitely run out of powder quickly if you do both hands and like to do Japanese style nails.",3
I won't repurchase since I found other creams that work better for me. This one is a bit rough for my sensitive skin. (burns slightly immediately after application),3
"I received the Jerdon Makeup Mirror with some damage to the box, but the item was in perfect condition. It's a fairly large mirror to sit on a counter. I really like the lighting options: Day, Office, Evening or Home. You can adjust the lighting with just a slide of a button. The product is well made, sturdy and has a adjustable height feature in the back. My niece and son's girlfriend both want it--they loved it for putting on makeup. I especially like the magnifying mirror so you can see those tiny eyebrow hairs to tweeze. It also features an outlet on the front to plug in a curling iron. Highly recommended.",4
"I was extremely disappointed about the size of this product. It is nothing at all like the pictures. I measured it and each cane is 2cm. Really horrible and I ordered 2 sets which came in 1 package. The shipping came on time, but the canes are a disaster. Don't buy this, it is smaller than your pinky finger and very skinny. Each slice is about the size of a tiny stud/ earring. I HATE IT- This is smaller than an eraser. It is similar, close to the size of a coin. This came in 2 ziploc bags, because I ordered 2 sets.Although the patterns are nice, you cannot begin to imagine how disgusting it is! Very small",1
"Ok i really like this. It cleans my face and for the price i think it's perfect for the daily routine. I've seen it selling regular price $35 and up and no way im spending that much less $150 for a clarisonic. This does the job, get my pores clean and i've seen and felt a difference since. Recommended.",4
"You get 3 in this set in jelly like colors. Functional and affordable for your haircolor needs, I purchased these when buying my haircolor.",5
"It really doesn't do much to my lashes at all.  I was really disappointed.  This got decent reviews, but iI am not seeing an of it.",2
"I have oily skin, so finding a good soap is important my skin and sanity. Usually dry soaps left my skin too dry, but did take away the oil. I thought after a while that that just can't be good. So I ventured from body washes to soap bars, and found the basis Sensitive Skin soap.In a word: sweet.This soap lathers rather well with loofah, and doesn't need much to get my full body. My skin does indeed feel smother and softer during and after the wash. I tried other soaps after just to make sure it wasn't my mind playing tricks on me, but, sure enough, I noticed the difference.It's a bit pricey, but for oily and sensitive skin, it's the best I've used so far. There may be a better soap, but I haven't found it. Amazon sure makes it easy to order this soap, and it works just as nice.",5
"It worked with my acne, but I really don't get much of zits. Very rarely I would get it. It worked for my minor acne problems.",5
"I love this brand and have been trying all the different products.  I especially love the the hand soap.  The Geranium scent is very strong and very feminine.  You would not want this in your kitchen, I wouldn't think, or anywhere where men would be using it.  The scent reminds me of the talcum powder I used to have when I was young, the kind that came in a box with a puff.  Very floral and powdery.  The scent is strong enough to smell the minute I go in the bathroom, almost like there is potpourri in the room. The soap is not harsh at all and the container is great - you can use every last drop of the soap without having to add water.",5
It wasn't my color. Even if it was it was speed of oily and I don't like that. I had to give it to a friend because of the color.,2
I used to use a lot of drug store soaps like Dove and Olay and I found myself smelling really pretty but my skin not feeling the greatest even when I put my lotion on. I decided I wanted to make a switch to a more natural soap without all those harsh chemicals used as fill ins in most of those types of soap and I am glad I did. It smells nice but the smell isn't lasting which I love especially during the summer when all the buggies like to follow you around. You can feel yourself being cleaned but not striped of moisture and my skin has a nice healthy glow to it now. It's a bit pricey but it's well worth the purchase (it's also available at walmart).,5
"Received them today. December 10, 2012 thanks..they are small but for the price their worth having and buying and I would probably buy something similar again in the future.",5
"Thank goodness for this! I have used several products for my occasional body acne (which occurs down my spine and across my shoulders during monthly hormonal wackiness...) and this has helped sooo much! I don't have really bad acne or scars, just a sprinkling of small bumps which aren't noticeable unless you are touching my skin or only about a foot away, but I know they are there and it bugs me!I use this with a washcloth or loofah to really scrub deep and exfoliate. For some reason regular soap or body wash is not enough and my shoulders need to be exfoliated more often than the rest of my body. Afterward I moisturize with sweet almond oil or coconut oil. I've had great results. I've been using this for less than 4 months and have seen a drastic difference in my monthly outbreaks.",5
I am a 29 year old woman with oily/acne prone skin. I also love in south Florida which means that I am dealing with tons of heat and humidity. I have tried many things in the past and I must say this has been the best so far. It does a great job exfoliating. It leaves my skin feeling soft and so fresh. I could honestly say that I saw a difference within the first week of using this cleanser. I have tried the normal Proactive face wash and it was not as good as this one. It's a great deal since you do get 24oz. this will last a while. I recommend this for people with oily/acne prone skin. It&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t dry you out or make you flaky. Give it a try you have nothing to lose and everything to gain =),5
This eye liner goes on smoothly and doesn't smudge.  I don't know why I even bother to try other brands that always disappoint.  This is the best pencil liner.,5
"These seem to work pretty well as makeup removers. I've used them on everyday makeup, as well as on full face paint, and they powered through all of it. The extra orangey-smell is nice too. I'm not sure how much good the &#34;vitamin C&#34; part is doing me. I haven't noticed a difference. So I'm not sure if these are any better than regular face wipes. But they do feel lovely!",4

"Curel's Rough Skin Rescue Lotion doesn't disappoint. This moisturizing lotion will ensure that your skin remains moisturized. I liked this particular brand, because the lotion didn't have a strong smell, and didn't irritate my skin (which is prone to eczema).",4
"Biolage by Matrix Color Ca Shampoo -  I love it.  It doesn't have all the yucky chemicals in it that I don't trust.  And it is safe for color treated hair.  It is a good deal, here.  What isn't there to like?  :)",5
"Good product, well pigmented, long lasting beautiful finish, the balm does just fine in its function of hydration, I give it three stars of punctuation",3

"I got this product in another store but is the same product. When I applied the activator smell that crazy glue. Be careful your eye could get irritated. After I applied the first coat I thought it was bad, really bad...but I repeat the process again activator and polish over and I was thinking I need another coat of shine so I applied activator again...yes...and it looked really good!! Considering that my right hand was done by my left hand... if a friend do it for you I think it will look better. All you need is practice!I gave this product 5 star before but next morning it chipped!! This is worse than taking off acrylic nails!! This stuff is glued! I had to use paint thinner and scrub it!! Some part of my nails still have the crazy glue...",2
"I got this as a choice on Amazon Vine to review. Overall, not a rebuy. I think it is all show and not any better substance than typical sunblock. I think the snazzy packaging and appearance of the product are it's best points. Yes, of course it smells nice, like coconuts and makes me dream of being on a tropical beach. The price per volume is not a good deal at all. I do like the cap on the bottom/stand up design, but so does the ""cheap"" stuff I buy at W-mart where I get 3x's the volume for the same cost as this. One of my kids and myself tend to have fairly sensitive skin and this did not bother us, but then again neither does the Equate brand for kids. The product arrived in bad condition-a padded packing envelope and the top had opened inside and leaked. It was quite messy and that attractive printing ""label"" was dissolved and worn off by the oils of the product. I'll stick to my regular supply which does everything I want it to and doesn't cost nearly as much.",3
"I've read so many good reviews about this. I've never really had problems with body acne until a few years ago when I would go to the tanning bed every week and damage the crap out of my skin (one of my biggest regrets). After that, I started randomly breaking out on my back, and it never really stopped. It's not severe but I still get a few random blemishes here and there to this day. And nothing is more attractive than a girl wearing a tank top with a pimple or two revealed on her back, right? Sigh but anyway, I decided to try this out. The smell/coldness didn't bother me because it's medication and you just have to suck it up. I didn't deduct stars because of that. I gave it a 3 star because it pretty much didn't do anything and in fact made it worse? It didn't make me break out any more than usual but the blemishes that I already had didn't really go away... but instead just grew dark? I used this for a good two weeks and I stopped using it because the blemishes started to look like discolored scars. After I stopped using it though, that luckily went away and so did the discoloration. This may work well for others but it just wasn't right for my skin :(",3
"I love this brand - my skin is sensitive and combination. This is the only brand so far that I have tried products from that have actually worked! No skin irritation, just smooth skin afterward. I love it. However, it is hard to spread on face as it dries quickly!",5
Good quality product. I use this on my step-daughter. It seemed to help her eczema and did not have an offensive smell.,4
Ardell 110 are great for those with shorter lashes wanting a bit more extra.  These won't look all spidery and overdramatic.  Good quality lashes.,5
"I like this straightener. It is much better than the discount store/drugstore ones I've tried. It gets very hot and the plates don't damage my hair.However, I have a different Remington model straightener that I like better. This one is sleek but not quite as heavy. The button placement is better on this one than the other one. The buttons are on the side and out of the way on this one. On my other Remington one the buttons are so conveniently-placed on the outside that it's hard not to push them by mistake. However that one has a button-lock feature.This one has a strip down the center of one of the plates that's supposed to sense the hair and automatically adjust the temperature to make sure it's not too hot.I admit I don't begin to understand the technology behind this appliance and I don't know if it is really ""infused"" with conditioners or not. But I do know it works well and does not damage my hair like some other ones I've used.The sides are a little sharper-edged than I'd like. I prefer sides that are slightly rounded.Overall, a great product and I would recommend it.",4
"This beast of a razor has 5 blades that lie flush with the skin.... the whole head lies flat against the skin. It is a different angle of shaving than I am used to and I can't believe that someone didn't think of this sooner! Whoever's bright idea this was deserves HUGE a pat on the back! No more worries about cutting the back of my knee area, the knee or back of my leg trying to get the right angle. The razor just glides flat across the skin. I actually enjoy using this razor. My legs were silky smooth as this razor also has a moisturizing serum strip on both the top and bottom of the head. It also works perfect in the underarm and bikini area. With 5 blades, 1 swipe is plenty. I will never buy another type of razor again! The head is much larger than my other disposable razors. The handle is also much larger. This razor is like no other that I have ever tried. You will not be disappointed, more like PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! Way To Go Schick!",5

I've been searching for decades for a product that would control (if not eliminate altogether) the constant shine of my t-zone. I think i've found it!!! I've only been using it for a month but so far so good. The minute it goes on you can feel your skin become matte without feeling tight like it's being pulled. Plus it doesn't have the greasy feel ALOT of other shine control products have these days. The control lasts all day. Of course i still have to blot but now i use 2-3 sheets daily instead of 6-8. Try it!!!,5
"I am Italian and have very thick, long eyebrows that can at times be crazy.  Over the years I have tweezed them down to nothing and let them grow back, only to tweeze them to death all over again.  Right now they grow in at different times and are a little thin in some spots while thick and long in others.  My hair is dyed platinum blonde so my natural brows are a little too dark.  I have to fill them in or else I will look undone and a little weird.  I like a color a few shades lighter then my natural brows because my hair is so light now.  I am a huge NYX fan so I knew they wouldn't let me down with this product, and they didn't!  I have tried a few eyeliner markers before and didn't really like how they turned out.  This color looks very natural even though the color of the marker looks a little orangish.  It goes on very easily and you can control how thin or thick you want the brow to be.  It stayed on all day long and looked as perfect as it did in the morning by the time I came home from work in the rain.  The price is great for the quality of the product.  I have no complaints, I just hope it doesn't dry out quickly because I have had that problem with a few other brand's eyeliner markers.",5
"Love the cream it doesn't gives me zits or breakouts so that's amazing for me, loving it, I only use it for sleep and I see some wrinkles going down!!!! I am only 22 but we have thin, dry skin on my family so by 15 we have wrinkles around our eyes and lots of expression lines.... Well I think this cream is really good, really makes you feel younger... I am only using it for sleep time and works like a charm...",5
love love love it! this brush is amazing. love the way how it feels so soft working on the lid.,5
i love essie so much and this color is so amazing.  this color is a very vibrant color that is amazing for spring.,5
"These are great fangs, they come with powder and liquid to mold them to your teeth and you only have to mold them once no glue no mess every time you put them in they're also VERY comfortable and easy to speak with. Scarecrow makes larger fangs but I would recommend these, they are the perfect size and despite being labeled as small they are rather noticeable. If these ever get ruined/lost/breakdown I will 100% buy them again.",5
"After reading many travel hints, one is that in Europe, many  hotels don't provide wash clothes for your bathing, therefore it would be wise to bring your own.  You would want something that dries quickly so you can be sure it would be dry when you need to pack again.  This is one of those things that is so simple in nature but so valuable to use. The bath wash cloth feels so good as it can reach be used as a back washer, exfoliator, wash cloth all in one. I would recommend that you would use caution on your face or other delicate skin but otherwise it is great to use and perfect for travel.",5
I purchased this and I take it everywhere I go just to show it off. I absolutely love this product at a very good price for very good quality I am amazed,5
Its not horrible but its not amazing. Just your standard run of the mill lotion. Nothing too moisturizing about it. An overall average product.,3
I wont use anything else as a toner now. It smells amazing. There is no use in paying more for a fancy toner. This stuff is old school and legit.,5
"Although this lotion is marketed for use on the face and neck, I will be using it up as a hand creme rather than a facial lotion because it causes my eyes to burn. I've had this problem with other face lotions, so I guess my eyes are just really sensitive. I normally use a facial lotion made for sensitive skin by another company and it is one of the only products I have found that doesn't bother my eyes. Since this product says ""Ultra Gentle,"" I thought perhaps it would work for me, but no.However, my freakishly sensitive eyes aside, I really like this lotion. It has a good feel (very smooth and silky), goes on nicely, is absorbed quickly, and has a faint pleasant scent. I plan to keep this lotion on the shelf over the sink and use it on my hands. I think it would also be a fine facial lotion for the average person.",4
"Axe has a couple of different Face Wash formulas.  They have several liquid/lotion formulas-- the best, by a VERY big margin is their ""ContrOil"" formula but they also offer a ""foam"" formula.***Axe's Shield Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin is a good product.  I like it much better than most of the liquid-based formulas.  The suds come out fairly light but as you apply it and rub it into your skin, it holds up and becomes almost like a paste.Instead of just washing it off, I elected to shave it off.Good multi-purpose product.",4
"HG=holy grail ;)I love this foundation, this is my second time around with it, the first time wasn't so pleasant simply because I was never properly matched. It was close but the undertones were wrong. Now I wear Tahoe instead of Cadiz which matches my yellow/olive undertones much better where as Cadiz was more red/pink. It can go on very sheerly or build up to a medium finish, it isn't a full coverage foundation. It will last you quite some time, you only need just a tiny bit to cover the face, unless you use a sponge because that tends to soak up more foundation than a brush or your fingers :) The one thing I would change is adding a pump (that i don't have to pay for) its much more sanitary. You can purchase the pump separately for $6 from [...]. Other than that, I recommend getting matched, grabbing a sample, trying this foundation out. It looks very natural and feels amazing on the skin.",5
"This gloss is definitely on the tacky side.  Not exactly sticky, more tacky.  It stays put.  I easily got 6 hours of wear from it.  Comes in a great range of colors.  Very impressed with the L'Oreal Infallible line overall and definitely with this product in particular.",5
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&#34;You want us to what?&#34; asked my housemates.&#34;Exfoliate!  It's eeeeeeeeasy.  Just use it.  Put your bodywash on there, and scrub.&#34;Boy did I get the hairy eyeball.  Oh well.  If I find something fishy in my coffee, I know where they live.Upon examination, these &#34;bath towels&#34; are not towels.  Towels get you dry.  These take your skin off.  Ok, not really, but getting you dry is not on their list of objectives.  Taking off dead skin however is just what they like to do most.  I thought they were scratchier than a common pouf/synthetic loofah.  Even felt up a few at the store just to see if the ones I had hanging around were wearing out.  The sheets (I hearby refuse to call them towels) are pliable and create a mass of suds with a reasonable amount of bodywash.  The length and width were just right for getting my back, something I normally would need a long handled scrub brush for.  Rinsing takes a little longer compared to a pouf or washcloth, but only a little extra.  Cleaned and out of the shower, my skin was pink and tingly.  Ok, they work.In terms of price, not too bad.  One could cut these down into small sections, turning 3 into several more and saving a bit of change.  I'd call them a win so far.  As for the housemates, I guess I should have warned them about where on the body it wasn't a good idea to use them.  I'll be keep an eye on my coffee for a while.",4
OPI nail polish is always the best & this sparkly gold color is another one. Looks great on! Love it!,5
I love these dotting tools. There are different sizes so you can make your dots as small as you want to be or as big as you want them to be.,5
"This is a great polish to use as a layering color.  I have many Gelish colors, and I use this color as a topper over all of my nails.... or as a topper on an accent nail or two.  Used either way, this is such a nice addition to my polish arsenal",5
"I brought this product and soon afterwrards severe breakouts appeared all over my checks. After that, I brought a higher end foundation, and my cheeks soon cleared up.  Would not recommend this product.",1
I won a gift set that included this item back at the end of August 2009.  I have been using this facewash since the beginning of September 2009 and still have about 1/2 a bottle!  It smells really natural/herby and the ingredients are all natural and organic.  I love the way it makes my skin feel (clean but not tight) and my acne has decreased considerably since using it.  Love this stuff!,5
"I use this product daily, as well, I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage. I have dry sensitive skin so this product has been perfect for me. I can't recommend a better daily facial lotion, especially for the price.",5
"I am not too pleased with this purchase. After all the great reviews, I was expecting more. But may be ok for the price",2
Is what it is. Thick sturdy plastic. Got it quick. Holds the wig  right and snaps/ locks in place. Good.,5
I own a MIA for which these brushes go. I love my MIA. It is really a great product and hope it doesn't doesn't stop. If it does I'll just order another. Quik delivery service was GREAT!,5
After reading several reviews on this I decided to give it a shot and am abosultey glad I did. It's not to oily and the smell is kind of mellow so it's not overbearing. I use it twice a day and have noticed a major improvement after only two weeks. I will definitely continue using this. Two thumbs up,5
"Not the best smell in the world, definitely smells like tanning lotion, but it works and it's a great price. See results every time I use it, several shades darker, and not orange. I'll probably buy it again as it's about 1/4 of the price of the lotion I was using before.",4
"First time user of this product - like the feel of clean skin following use - cheeks were a bit sore first couple of uses, so opted to use it every other day.",5
This product did nothing to minimize the redness of my skin.  My face had just s much redness after I used it and added a foundation.,2
This brush is so large and is easy to apply finishing powder with it. It evenly distributes the product over the face. The brush is very soft and I have not had any fall out of bristles so far. Its easy to wash and it dries very fast.,5
I don't use many skin care products as I am not too vain. But I needed something and came across this moisturizer for men. The reviews looked encouraging so I got it. Pretty good stuff. Easy to use and feels good. My skin feels smooth and replenished. I am up there in age so I hope it prevents my skin from premature aging.  I don't spend a lot of time out in the sun so that should help. I like this stuff.,5
"I love this shampoo. I was looking for a less chemical laden alternative and tried this. I love it. You have to get accustomed to the lesser sudsy-ness, but once you do that you'll never go back. I highly recommend lather, rinse, lather again for the best result. My hair is clean, soft and manageable.",5
"This is my favorite! It not only smells good , but it holds my fine, kinky hair down... I had to figure out were it helped my hair the best and when styling the smoothie makes the job easier. The smell is beyond imaginely magnificent ! One of my other staple products.",5
Just think the Dior mascara black out is amazing and now I have found my choice forever!  No clumps and comes off very well.,5
"This sunscreen is on the pricier side because it makes the claims of being longer lasting than the average sunscreen with the anthelios formulation and lightweight. Neutrogena has a long lasting helioplex formula (same concept as this sunscreen's anthelios) and is way cheaper. A lot of people made the complaint of the white cast, which I have kind of learned to accept in high spf sunscreens since they are attempting to reflect sunlight off the skin. Although this aspect bothers me a little, it doesn't really deter me because it is the basis of the sunscreen's effectiveness. What DID deter me majorly was the smell. There is a strong petroleum smell to this product that gives me headaches. If you are sensitive to scents, then I would definitely go and try a tester of this product at a drugstore before purchasing. I don't notice this smell with Neutragena. I will continue to use Neutragena's helioplex formulated sunscreens even though they aren't as lightweight as La Roche-Posay mainly because of the smell issues.",2
"Product was surprising poor - It's drying, not hydrating, and the sunscreen odor is a bit hard to take. A waste of my money.",1
"This product will keep your hair voluminized for days!  Just a few spritzes into your roots and volume, volume, volume.  You will not have to reapply until your wash your hair again!",5
"Well this is fun to use! did it make a difference? no, not really.....this is ok I guess. smells good.",3
"so&#8230; my skin is experiencing premature signs of aging&#8230; fine lines, sagging and etc&#8230;since my face is so sensitive and can&#8217;t tolerate any peels or other acids, I decided to give vitamin C serum a try. I really like the packaging that I received, there was a separate packaging for the pump which helps to keep it sanitary.So far feels good on the skin but I still can&#8217;t use it more than 2 times a day, will start feeling tingle and see redness on my skin&#8230;However, I must say my skin becomes brightened after 2-3 days of use, radiant and clear!!! It doesn't cause any breakouts. I haven&#8217;t use it long enough to see whether it can actually diminish brown spots, but the fact that my skin is brightened feels great!It does improve skin texture, but just be careful if you have sensitive skin and not to use it more than once a day in the beginning.",4
"I have been using this color for the last year with great results.  I no longer have to go to the salon every other month, and can keep my roots in check every three-weeks or so!  The range of colors are natural enough so that applying the dye isn't too daunting for newcomers.  I have ashy blonde hair, and the Reddish Blonde color I've been using stays true for quite a while; it does eventually fade with time, but it's not so sudden that it all washes out in the shower like other color products can.The quality of the product is also fantastic.  After coloring, my hair feels silky and strong.  Overall, this is a great brand of color.  I'm so glad I decided to try coloring at home; the results are much more natural, and it's easier on my wallet.",5
"It shipped so fast, so that was very pleasant and the products work great! Same thing that you would pick up at the drug store but cheaper!! I love it.  I will definitely be purchasing from them again and I have already recommended it to my friends!",5
I am very happy I ordered these nail tips. They are awesome. The best I have used. They cradle the nail tip perfectly. The plastic is not cheaply made its great quality.  I recommend these 100%,5
"Bought this because of all the good reviews and I needed some help with my bad cuticles. I stuck with it for a while and really gave the oil a chance, but it just did nothing for me.It does have a nice smell though.",2
"So, I luv yes to carrots SHAMPOO. my scalp felt so clean, it had a decent lather and my curls felt clean. I was a little on the fence at first but after a second time, I am a fan. I have kinky hair so usually organic shampoos don't do it for me. I didnot purchase this on Amazon, I got it from Target but I also saw in Walmart and walgreens. I will reccomend this to a freind or a foe.",5
"I used this product for the past month which is about how long the container lasted.  I only used it on my neck.  I do feel like it has helped reduce lines and creepiness.  No smell which is a great plus for me.  Many of the fragrant ones are too strong.  It has a very silky, not heavy texture.  I will probably reorder soon since it really takes about 3 months to see true results of skincare products.",4
The product Rocks - the only thing is that when shipping it may leak a bit. The seller was wonderful and sent me a refill for what had leaked. Great product just the mfg of the bottle should have designed it better (with a seal of some kind - at least when brand new). :-),5
"Been using this for years. Lightweight lotion, no over-powering smell. Good base for my Bare Minerals makeup. Absorbs well. Handy size.",5
"I love argan Oil and while I usually use another competitor, I decided to give Watts' argan a try as I do like other products from Watts.  It does not disppoint!",5
I'm not much on skin care products and personal care items. usually a little soap and water is good enough for me.  I really like the face wash.  my face feels clean and fresh  Also works great as a shaving cream substitute.  Definitely worth the purchase,4
"I received these items, with in the date range stated by the seller. They came very well packaged for shipment. They appear to be great quality and a nice variety of tips, for tons of design possibilities. I bought these brushes for gel nail polish designs. Although I haven't used these yet, they appear to be exactly what I need to make cool nail designs. Showed some friends of mine (who are also into nail designs) and they also thought the brushes were great.",5
I love them! They are smaller than I expected but I can still use them. I have used them for nail art on my moms nails and she loved the end result. I have had a lot of compliments when I use them.,5
"This stuff smells edible!  LOVE it!  Works great, as well - I use it before gel for my curly hair.  It was recommended on the site naturallycurly.com, which is a great resource for curly-haired girls.  I'm attempting to actually learn to LIKE my hair curly and so far, this product has really helped!",5
This is an amazing mirror and the magnification is awesome.  I've had other lighted magnifying mirrors and they do not compare to this one.  I love the extra long cord so I can use it various locations without having to move the cord from plug to plug.,5
"I have been using the conditioner for almost 3 years and it does a great job, smells good and creamily mositurizes your hair.  I tried other sulfate free conditioners for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.  The cost of the product is worth, less expensive that a retail store purchase such as Ulta.",5
"I know Timeless Skin care for some other products and I'm happy with them, getting a bottle of Hyaluronic serum in 8 oz (!) makes me feel comfortable I won't have to rush another supply too soon.",5
"I should have read all the comment before I bought this product, looks great when you put it on but if you put a top coat the colors fades away. I guess for the prize I cant complain.",2
"I like the smell and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. It produces many bubbles and it's easy to use!But when your face is really dry, don't use it because it hurts.",4
Derma e Vitamin A Glycolic Cleanser really cleared up my acne andfade my dark acne marks too. My skin has never felt so good sinceI've been using this product. I would recommend this product toanyone who has acne.,5
"I'm not sure what everyone else is complaining about, I've never had issues with this mascara being &#34;stringy&#34;. The only time I have issues with clumping is if I apply several layers of this stuff. Other than that this mascara is fabulous. It noticeably makes my lashes longer and thicker. Also, in the past I've dealt with mascara that is so heavy it ruins the curl on my lashes. This mascara definitely does not have that problem! It's a little pricey but I can't use anything else!",5
"*I received this to reviewI have been using this for a few weeks now.  I like how it feels like it washes clean, my scalp is less itchy, and my hair looks great!I think it is well moisturized and a little goes a long way.  I do not get bad cases of dandruff at the moment, just small little flakes,and this took case of that. No flakes on my black.  It did work for my issues.  :)",4
My daughter uses them on her nails and they work really well. Lots of different color choices. And there not that hard to put on.,5
"Lately, I have not been kind to my hair, and it has shown, unfortunately. I'm getting back on track, but in the meantime, what to do? My hair is just below shoulder length, very thick, and very curly. I've been wearing it naturally, but need more styling products to keep it from frizzing, and I think that has taken a toll. So I've been straightening it, and that shows far more damage.So, when Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil came available, I decided to give it a try. So, so, so glad I did!! I washed my hair thoroughly the night I received this product, towel dried it, and then applied this stuff. The instructions say to use 2 to 3 pumps, and I used 3. The consistency reminds me a bit of baby oil - I can tell it's an oil, but it isn't thick. I rubbed my hands together, and then ran them through my damp hair. I then combed the product through. Because I was going to be straightening my hair in the morning, I let my hair air dry, and went to bed.When I awoke, I could tell instantly my hair felt better. It was silkier and much shinier. Once I straightened it, I couldn't be the difference! My hair looked so much better and shinier, but it didn't have a ""weighed down"" look to it - it still had body to it. There was no stiffness, no stickiness. My hair felt silky, smooth, wonderful! And looked so much better than it did - with just one application!There was a scent when I opened the bottle and put the oil on, but I thought it was very light and not offensive at all. I think most soaps, shampoos and conditioners have a much stronger smell. And, once my hair dried, the odor was gone. Naturally, scents and odors can affect people differently, and what might not bother one person, may be extraordinarially invasive to another.When I washed my hair, I did not find any difficultly washing this product out. In fact, I went a number of days before having to wash my hair, and my hair still looked and felt great! I only had to shampoo once, and I felt all of the product was removed.I am really surprised by this product and its results. And the fact that so little of it is needed to obtain results. Who have thought it would have come from Suave? What a pleasant surprise!",5
"The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.FRAGRANCETypical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Complete Care), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.  This Sport Mint variety has a little bit of a cooling sensation.  I find shampoos with this ingredient (tea tree oil) can by drying, but my hair feels soft after this one.TEXTUREAnother review nailed the texture as ""melted ice cream."" More importantly, it lathers well and is easy to spread through even long hair.CLEANINGI really tested this aspect, since I've been moving a cut up pine tree and was covered with dirt and sap.  I needed to get all of that stuff off before I had an allergy attack.  This Sport Mint shampoo was not as effective as cheap clear shampoos at really cutting through all that junk, but it did pretty well.  After two uses, my hair was very clean, but not stripped and frizzy.OVERALLClear Cool Sport Mint shampoo is a pretty good choice among the dandruff control options, and even if you don't have dandruff issues.  I like the subtle cooling sensation and my hair is clean and soft.",4
"I absolutely loved this foundation at first.  There is a lot to like about it. It has an amazing dewy finish and instantly makes your skin look vibrant and youthful.  I am 36 years old and it gave me a glow I never had before.  It feels lightweight on but provides amazing coverage.  Creamy Natural was a perfect match for my light to medium olive skin. I also tried one shade up Natural Buff 166 and it was way to dark and orange.Now for the problems:1.  The color seems to oxidize and look orangey.  They all do this except maybe the ivories but those are WAY too light for me (I tried and looked like a Geisha).2.  The foundation seems to sit on top of my skin and never soaks in so that it would come off easily onto clothing etc.  This problem lasted for hours.3.  When I looked at myself in natural sunlight my makeup was extremely noticeable.  THat might be the makeup itself or be might be the fault of the packaging which really is a cool idea but doesn't work out so well in practice.  The brush is nice but it is very hard to control how much product comes out of the tubeSo, in the meantime I have gone back to Covergirl Advanced Radiance which I don't absolutely love (matte finish not dewy or glowing) but it is lightweight and has a no makeup feel and, as an added bonus, when I look at myself in natural light I am not horrified.  But, while it covers, it doesn't do much else for my appearance.Still on the search for the perfect foundation for me and will let you all know if I ever find it ;)",3
"I received one packet of these wipes from the Vine program. I don't use this type of product but my wife does which is why I requested them and I gave them to her. Her opinion is that these wipes are not capable of giving her a thorough type cleaning but they do have a useful purpose. She uses them during the day when she needs a light cleaning prior to reapplying makeup. They do not have an odor of any consequence. The container has a flap which seals nicely to keep the wipes moist. Overall, she rates them good but not great.",4
"I really like this masque, it did leave my hair very soft.  It smells good.  I rarely have time to use this, because it recommends to put it on your hair and leave on for 5 minutes.  a shower cap is definitely necessary.  I will save this for when I have the time and want to pamper myself.  Works well though.",4
"The flowers were shipped efficiently and are package really well. I like to put a clear nail polish with glitter or a pale pink polish with the flowers. I wish it came with four containers of the bigger flowers instead of two. The bigger flowers are light and dark pink. The rest of the containers are smaller flowers that come in a circular form, as shown in the photos, to use as background. I did use nail glue to place the bigger flowers. They do make for a cute nail designs, but for me, the flowers started to fall off within a day or two.",4
"So I'm in love with these brushes. I originally bought it as a gift for a friend and fell completely in love for it. Now I am buying all kits for myself and an extra one for another friend.These don't shed at all!!! I've been using it for about a month and it looks new! I also own the Coastal Scents Kit and let me tell you, these are faaar better. Far better than even MACs and other brands you find in Sephora. Totally worth the money!The mirror is HUUUUGE for pocket size, so I walk with it everywhere!I have 2 complains, though. I feel like for this kit, an angle brush is seriously missing. Also that the clutch feels kind of cheap. But the brushes completely pay off for any negative point!I posted pictures!LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! s2",5
"I really like this product and the price, as well. It does help you slim down withoutintoxicating the body with strange chemicals. I use it with a slimming vest for the tummy and termal bermuda for the tighs and buttocks. I will reorder this product in the future.",5
"I have fairly dark eyebrows but they are sparse in one area and they could use a little more definition.  I have a fair to med complexion and brown/frosted hair and I generally use dark brown eyeliner.  The med brown was absolutely perfect.  I thought it was very easy to apply.  I followed the directions as provided and was happy to see that the applications are in gel caps so that you don't have much waste.  I will update when I get an idea of how long it lasts, but for now, I'm tickled not to have to get out my magnifying mirror to fill in and shape my eyebrows.  I'll probably continue to use clear hair setting gel and a brow brush to shape, but it isn't going to make a big difference until the dye wears off.Now I'm going to look for their eyelash curling product...",5
This primer really made the difference with how my liquid foundation goes on and how it looks when done. It made my foundation look perfect! I love it and will be ordering more when I start to get low.,5
"""Axe Anti-dandruff Styling Cream, 3.2 Ounce"" works well enough. It holds hair lightly in place (not too stiff or sticky, as some styling creams can be), and it smells pleasant.That being said, since I use a dandruff shampoo that does its job well (that is, controlling my dandruff), I cannot vouch for its dandruff control properties. However, ""Axe Anti-dandruff Styling Cream"" contains pyrithione zinc, which is the same active ingredient found in my dandruff shampoo. Is it redundant/necessary to use both a dandruff shampoo/conditioner and dandruff styling cream? You be the judge.In all, recommended.",4
The greatest deep conditioner I have ever used in my life!!!! If you have tried the original Silicon Mix you will LOVE Silicon Mix Pearl. It leaves my hair with the most  beautiful shine and smoothness I've always wanted. It also smells great which is a plus for me. In addition it really does control your hair from frizzing like it claims to do on the jar.,5
"I use these to remove my makeup and sunscreen before cleansing my face. The cloths are sufficiently moist but not drippy, and they're perfectly-sized; one sheet is plenty for your face and neck. The scent, although pleasant, is a bit strong. That said, nothing in these irritates my skin or causes any reactive breakouts, so I'm not particularly bothered by the fragrance. Others may find it to be too much. The pack is supposed to be re-sealable, but I find that the adhesive 'wears off' shortly after opening. (I have to store them in a zip-loc baggie to prevent them from drying up, because the flap no longer sticks shut like it's meant to.) I don't know if I'd feel comfortable using these on their own for facial cleansing, but that's just my personal preference; I like to cleanse afterwards with Cetaphil so that I know I'm getting my face clean and not simply removing dirt, makeup, etc. from the skin's surface. I've tried other facial wipes, and these Ponds Original are the only ones that don't cause irritation and still do the job. Thumbs up!",4
"love the color of this, it gives a wash of color the only thing is is does not last longmaybe an hour or two and must reapply for that fresh color",3
I use this as the base for my at home oil cleansing method and as an addition to my hair oil deep conditioning treatment.  It's great for both!,5
"This is a gorgeous, bright pink with a hint of purple to it. I bought it as a color to add to my summer collection, and was thrilled to find it at half the price of most of the other Gel polishes out there. I've been slowly adding to my collection, a bit at a time. I have primarily Harmony brand, but I've been branching out into Haute Polish and IBDs as well. I've been more than satisfied with the quality of them all!I've been satisfied with the IBD polishes I've received so far, and absolutely love the prices. They last as long as gelish (which is usually until I get bored and soak them off!), and have such pretty, vibrant colors! At this time, I've been using them with the Gelish Foundation and Top It Off, and curing under an LED.",5
"I's 13 and i love Neutrogena. i bought this hoping that it would help my redness go away. it did. use this every day straight for eight weeks, and your supposed to have amazing skin. this is my second week and i see an amazinjg differnce. i know everyone is different in their skin types but i would deffinitly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. this is a great price. they also have a neutrogena visibly even foaming cleanser which i have not tried yet but want to. good luck.p.s. just a side not, you are not going to get an amazing face by just using drugstore/any cleanser. if you have bad acne, which was me 2 months ago, go to your regular doctor and they will prescribe you medication,. mine wasnt so bad that i need oral medice, but i have 2 topical medications. clindamicyn and differin. go to your doctor,it really really really really really helps! just thought of that real wuick hope it helped, and remember there is a helpful tool for those suckers to die! (your pimples):)",5
These are nice for when your traveling and don't why to pack all you cleansing supplies. Its all in one little wipe. I don't think I would forgo the moisturizer my skin felt a little dry after using. But if your in a jam and don't have time for the regular routine these work very well.,4
"Regardless of the price, this is the best perfume I've ever smelled in my life.  I really do like the light but distinctive sweet smell. I can't get enough of it.",5
Great eye solution for keeping the years at bay. Great price.  Recommended by dermatologist and love it. Can finally get rid of all my other eye product.,5
"Well, once again I got sucked into all these awesomely glowing reviews, but it's just not working for me. It's not hurting my face, but it's not making it better either. I use it with the apple cider vinegar. I keep it on for 20 to about 30 minutes always (varying times depending on how much time I have). Each time right after I wash it off, it feels awesome and smooth but immediately I dry my face, I see that it's just the water making an illusion.My skin doesn't look smooth anymore when it's dry and all the pimples are in the exact same spot. I guess it's working for others...but just not for me. I have mild acne, oily skin.Edit: So I know this edit is really long overdue, but after a while this product actually started to hurt my face, unlike the review I posted before. After prolonged use, I just got a really wrinkly forehead and my skin overrall just wasn't smooth anymore. Fortunately, this wasn't permanent, and I am now back to somewhat smooth skin after I stopped using it about a year ago. I think this just stretched my skin too much. Obviously, with the glowing reviews, it worked for some people. It just didn't work for me.",1
This was the first time I spent this much on a curling iron. I usually buy the cheapest one I can find. Well worth the money and &#34;bonus&#34; was that it came in my favorite color!,5
"i moved to PA from GA last june and i thought i would have to get my hair cut back off because my hair became dry and fragile. after a month or 2, i had finally got my dry and thirsty hair under control. well i thought i did at first. but after a couple months went by, the winter came and my hair became.... idk how to describe the condition of my hair!!!! i thought i was using too much protein because just about every product i used had protein in it so i stopped using protein products. (my hair wasn't use to the harsh winter, that is why it became so dry, not because of the proteins but at the time i didn't know that was the reason). once i stopped using protein, my hair became worse. it was SO DRY, the LOC method stopped working, then i started using shea butter, which helped a little. so i started spraying it with water almost everyday to keep it from drying out, which also helped a little bit but made it worse at the same time. it helped because the water added moisture to my hair and it made it worse because i was over moisturizing my hair and not adding any proteins. so my hair became mushy and felt wet even when it was dry. i started using biotin supplements, which only helped with hair growth. my hair went from a healthy 3c/4a/4b to a heat damaged (well in this case, a winter damaged) 2b( my hair didn't curl up at all anymore, it went from tight curls to big waves). my hair didn't look like healthy 2b hair, it looked like stringy and damaged 2b hair. my hair was mushy and felt wet but it also felt and sounded like dead leaves in the winter time. the best way i can describe how my hair felt like... wet dead leaves. my hair felt wet and mushy but the water was just sitting on the top of my hair strands but then i found the ApHogee 2 minute reconstructor and seen that it was for damaged hair and bought it. the 1 st time i used it i instantly noticed most curls came back (i lost all my lovely curls thanks to the wintery season). my hair isnt dull anymore, its back to it pre-winter state. i recommend this to people who hair was damaged by the wintery season. it says that its for heat damaged, hard water damaged, or permed hair but i had winter damaged hair and it worked so well. just make sure you deep condition, for moisture, after you use the reconstructor to balance your hair, because this is a protein treatment and you need to add moisture so your hair wont become dry and brittle.",5
"I can't quite place this ""creamsicle"" scent, but my first impression was something like petroleum oil.  The scent is a turnoff, but it does go away.  The lotion is rather thin, thus making it easy to overuse it.  Lotion is not moisturizer!  There is a complete difference, and I prefer a moisturizer.  The ingredients are plenty with plenty of fruits and other organics.  The lotion soaks in quickly and doesn't leave sticky or unpleasant residue.But for me.....It's that smell I can't overlook!!",3
My hair was dryish from a number of color treatments and I was hot packing expensive hair packs but it was still dryish. This worked. I am glad to have found it. It's way better than creme conditioners although it is one.,5
I ordered this shampoo and its matching conditioner in the hopes of having something all natural that wouldn't irritate my scalp. And happily this gets the job done while smelling nice too although it's not as heavily scented as I thought it would be. As with the conditioner my only complaint is it's not that great for my hair when it gets dried out in the winter. However it does a fantastic job of removing product buildup and on those few days when my hair is oily. I think it'll work great in the summer months and in the meantime I reserve this one for when I need to do a deep cleanse of my scalp and hair rather than using it on a daily basis. And an added bonus is the fact it does not have all the chemicals and crap like sulfates in it that irritate my skin so badly.,4
"I have been using this product for about six or seven years, ever since I say it on QVC.  I love this body builder.  Its better than any other product that I have ever used, and the reason why...is because I can use it for two to three days without my hair getting hard, stiff or unmanageable.  I have tried other sprays that claim to give you volume, hold and body, but my hair is too stiff...and when I go to use the comb in my hair the next day it feels like someone has slightly glued my hair together.  I dont like that feeling because that means more washing.  I will never use another product for volume because they just dont work for me.  I am very very pleased and will not be with out it.  The alcohol levels in this product is perfect for my hair.",5
"This mascara didn't WOW me at all, it's just okay. It's slightly on the dry side, I prefer a thinner, glossier texture. This comes out thick on the wand, and clumps easily if you don't apply carefully. I will not repurchase.",3
This is an okay moisturizer but nothing to write home about. It left my skin feeling very sticky even an hour after applied. I only use it at night because of this. Will not be repurchasing.,3
"This is a pretty reliable, sturdy little lamp. Dries my gel polish in 90 seconds with a little timer that turns it off when done. I can fit my foot in it as well so I'm gelled from hands to feet!",5
"This stuff is awesome!!  I already LOVE Kerastase, but this treatment is power packed to deliver soft, shiny, great looking hair!!!  Used it on my daughter's naturally golden long locks and her hair practically glows in the sunlight.",5
"i like this, they are very pigmented, there are some colors that i probably wouldn't wear cuz they are too bright but other tan that i love using this they are sooo many options on how to wear your make up every day, makes it much more fun. i use the lightest color as a highligther. Be carefull when aplyind all colors, they are VERY pigmented and i aply it with gentle strokes and little product. and the price could not get any better tan this",4
I bought this for my frizzy damaged hair & fell in love.  I use it with the shampoo & conditioner as well as there shine product.  My hair did a complete 180 and will never go back.  This is a good price for saloon style hair!  I would recommend this for anybody!  I was concerned it was a waste of money since it was not expensive but it's a huge bang for your buck!,5
"I don't give out five stars unless a product is pretty flawless; it has to meet or exceed its product claims, be fairly priced for what it claims to do, and have no obvious tweaks needed to make it better. This trifecta of excellence is rarer than you think but with this shampoo and its sister conditioner my hair has finally met its perfect match ....My hair: I am 42 years old, biracial with very curly, slightly/kinky hair. It is fine textured, light to medium density, and breaks VERY, VERY easily. My hair is not chemically processed so I occasionally use a flat iron or curling iron for styling. Mostly I wear a medium length afro style these days withJane Carter Solution Wrap and Roll, 8.5 Ounceas a styling aid to define the curls. Over the years I have used exclusive salon products like Ouidad, drug store brands, high end department store brands like Fekkai, earthy brands like Ojon, and just about everything in between. The results always left me searching for something that would help my hair feel and look healthy and strong. With all the trial and error I never found any one or two products that worked well enough to satisfy my needs. I can't comment as to how the shampoo works alone since I have used the conditioner as well from day one, but as far as my experience using both products I'd say that Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner produced results better than anything else I've ever tried.After the first shampoo and conditioner treatment I proceeded to comb through my hair while it was still wet, a task that usually involves a considerable amount of pulling and results in the inevitable huge hair ball that winds up tangled on the comb. With the Carol's Daughter Monoi products the amount of hairs on the comb was only about a quarter of what was usually shed with my former shampoo and conditioner. Suffice to say I was floored.....""92% reduction in breakage"" printed right there on the label is a pretty big claim to make and I was *very* skeptical of such a bold statement. I would have had no qualms about requesting refund if this product fell short of my expectations but this shampoo along with the conditioner delivers on its claims. With the first use I had about 75% less breakage than with my former products and the results have remained steady over six months of use. I waited to post this review because I wanted to see if I would need to switch products either due to the seasons changing or to see if buildup would happen or if the results would taper off; I've seen consistently EXCELLENT results over the months and for the first time ever as far as shampoos and conditioners goes I feel I have FINALLY found ""the one""!The scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is fabulous; leaves a light scent on the hair.Does not leave weight or residue on my hair with either the shampoo or conditioner which is VERY important since my hair is fine.For what seems like forever my hair was constantly the same length due to breakage but in the months since switching to Carol's Daughter I've gained over an inch of length.My hair is soft and manageable.Expensive but worth it and that's something I say very RARELY.Easily, happily and 100% recommended!",5
I like how it's in a tube so that you can squeeze out the product instead of scooping it out with your fingers. But I don't feel like this product exfoliates as well as some other products out there that are slightly cheaper. There just isn't enough grains but you will get a nice lather out of it. I prefer to use Tree Hut body scrubs couple times a week for exfoliation and the Earth Therapeutics in between.,3
"This eyeliner is terrific.  The point draws a precise, fine line, which is what I prefer, although you can go more dramatic if you choose.  The liner removes easily with a gentle swipe of a washcloth.  I was a little hesitant about using the black (I generally prefer to use brown) but the thin line looked great.  I recommend it, and will be using it from now on.",5
"This product is A+, does exactly what it says it does and keeps the job done well all day. Truly another excellent product from John Frieda!! Use it in the morning and take it with me but never seem to need it for a touch up even when it rains.",5
"I've been using this cream for a couple weeks and I see no change in my skin, I had been told by a skin doctor to purchase this product to fluff off extra unwanted skin cells",1
"These were my first brush kit and I'm in love with them! Buying more whenever I can! I didn't like the case, it could be a small bag or a cup like sigma brushes.",5
Why didn't they have these brushes when I was little getting my hair pulled out with an old school brush? This thing just works!! Love it!! Lefty model plz!!,5
This is one of my son's favorite styling products.  His hair stays put when he uses this!  He has fairly short hair and it really has the stay power.  Good and highly recommended by him.,5
"I really thought this was a well rounded shampoo.  It did many things for me, I felt it help to coat my hair follicles to help them from frizzing.  I thought for a shampoo this was a fairly good conditioner, and it smells very nice.  I like that it doesn't seem like  a watery mess like many shampoos.  My hair is colored this shampoo did not strip out the color from my hair.  I think this is a great every day shampoo.",5
it really helps if you have itchy scalp (it's bot about psoriasis or something like that though),4
"Perfect. I use it for blush, and it's so soft. These are literally Sigma brushes without the word Sigma on it.",5
It's the right combo of thick and natural- the shimmer isn't very noticeable but the over all look of the lashes is very nice.,5
"Ok ladies, I have hormonal acne, which I had prior to getting pregnant.  So, once I had to stop using my pre-pregnancy products my face exploded with pimples, thus I decided to buy this. I had very high hopes for it.  Well, I used it for about a week, and the smell is horrendous.  You can blame it on my enhanced sense of smell, but I really can't stand it, and since it isn't making any noticeable improvements on my skin, I will not use anymore.",2
This is my go to makeup brush for applying liquid foundation. I am glad I tried this out before splurging on a high end makeup brush when this one is fantastic and gets the job done!,5
"I've used Olay products most of my adult life, just as my mother did before me. I've known their products to be high-quality yet affordable, and the fact that my 45-year-old skin has very few fine lines is a testament to how well Olay skin care products work.That said, this little 'cleansing system' is an appalling addition to an otherwise respectable, excellent product line. While the thing claims to massage your skin, and the addition of a battery makes it *seem* like the thing would vibrate, it doesn't do anything more than your own hands can do while washing your face. Exfoliate? I don't think so -- the rubber nubs on the thing bend away at first contact with the skin. Your washcloth would work better.I can't speak to the cleanser at all. It wasn't included in the box, but I can't imagine that it could overcome the ineffectiveness of the little gadget in the box.",1
I bought this because I have heard great reviews on it and I use it before bed after cleaning my face.  Like with most face products though I never know if it works but it hasn't had a harmful effect on it.,3
"This product provides considerably more coverage than most BB creams I've tried.  It is definitely very light, but I have fair skin so it worked.  I also have acne prone skin, and this did not aggravate my acne - big plus!  My only complaint is that it leaves my skin very, very shiny.  You definitely need to follow this up with a setting powder.",4
"I love this color! I had been looking for a Barbie pink nail polish and this color is a winner! I do wish it was a little bit more opaque, it took me three coats to get it truly opaque, but not a big deal.",4
I have very fine straight brown hair so I have to be careful what products I get because I need several to style my hair the way that I want to. This had a wonderful smell(I was not sure when it says Seaweed) which was the first thing that I noticed. It made my hair feel soft and manageable just the way I like it.Would recommend!,4
"I have been a fan of the Clear brand since I tried my first shampoo and conditioner over a year ago. For whatever reason, the Clear brand has done wonders for my dry, dyed hair.I have a lot of fuzzies and flyaways on the top of my head. Maybe I put my reading glasses up there too often or maybe I just have too many rough ends up there. But I seem to wear a cap of fuzz on top of my head. Needless to say I was excited to try out Clear's Scalp and Hair Therapy Frizz Control Shampoo in conjunction with theClear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce. I wasn't sure how well it would work or how I would see if there was a difference but it was noticeably different on the first use.I don't know what they do but somehow, it works. My hair was smooth and easy to style on top. My frizz had settled down and my hair is really silky smooth. I know that terminology is overused but I keep running my hands through my hair telling everyone how nice it feels. Seriously. I was that goofy about it.So I highly recommend this for anyone with fuzzy, frizzy hair. It did a wonderful job for me.",5
"Detangles, smooths, but doesn't break hair. I gave it five stars because of the high quality product, construction and how nice it works.",5
"The images are cute. Love the images of the bird cages, bird houses, the keys and the bicycles. Only problem is that some images don't stamp well because the details are too small. Some lines are way too small for the stamping polish and stamper to get the image onto your nails.",3
"I bought this at the same time I bought the Loreal perfecting base. I loved the base, so I figured this would be even better.For me, it does not control oil at all. It also makes my pores and imperfections stick out and my makeup look too obvious. I tried applying it different ways, but it never looks good. I have oily/dry/acne prone skin, maybe that is the problem. I usually never notice my pores, but with this stuff they absolutely stick out. The Loreal base actually makes them disappear and I noticed that I don't need to blot often, if at all. Neither product caused me to break out.I'm going to stick with the Loreal base because I didn't like Estee Lauder's primer either.",2
"I have horribly dry and damaged hair. It's bad. I tried this treatment mask today after using my regular shampoo and conditioner. I left it on for three minutes and then rinsed it out in cool water. I noticed a difference in the amount frizz almost immediately after I dried my hair. I would say that it cut the frizz down by about 50%. It also helped my hair look smoother and shinier. I'm hoping that the more I use it, the better the result. As an added bonus, my hair smelled like I went to the salon. I really like the fragrance that they use. I plan on using it bi-weekly from here on out, and I'm hoping that it will continue to moisturize and heal my damaged hair.",4
"I'm not sure what kind of magic they put into this product, but it is hands down, the best hair product I have ever used in my life (I have 3a curls). Every hair on my head is in perfect ringlets when I use it. It looks like I've spent hours meticulously forming each curl into the perfect ringlet. I have used my fair share of different products and none of them even come close to beginning to start to approach how awesome this product is. I hope they never stop making it because I will never stop using it. It's so good that when I travelled recently and realized I forgot it and would have to go a whole week without, I went out and bought another (good thing it's only $3). You have to use quite a bit more than you think you'll need, at least a golf ball for just below the shoulder length. It feels disgusting and sticky and horrible right when it's first in, but if you massage it around until there's no white showing and let it dry, it is not crunchy or sticky at all. It's very important you put it in when your hair is very wet. Don't towel dry it first. After using this my curls are soft and touchable, something no other mousse has ever allowed.Update:This mousse is weirdly good as a straightening treatment. I applied this like normal, then decided I wanted straight hair that day. So I let it air dry until damp and got to work. My hair cooperated and then some. I straightened it, put it up in a bun and let it sit, then when I let it down my hair was glossy, sleek and looked JUST like Kate Middleton's hair. I was told multiple times I had princess hair and how amazing it looked. How odd! That just more solidifies that this is an HG product for anyone with curly hair.",5
I have used this a couple times now and it seems to be working well. It came packaged good and all the light bulbs went in easily. I have figured out the timer and it works very well. I love that it has a fan for drying regular polish as well. Both of my hands fit into the system. I noticed that the wattage on this one is higher than the one at my local salon. I feel this is a good product.,5
Its awesome to be able to let your expensive nail poolish last so much longer then it normally would. Buy it,5
"This is a cheap conditioner.  It is what it is, so I am giving it three stars.  There aren't really any super horrible ingredients from what I can see.  They're not all great, Behentrimonium Chloride can be irritating and can be flammable in high enough concentration...but it is a common ingredient in cheap conditioners and generally considered safe.  No parabens in here, so I give it that.The scent is ok, not fabulous.  It makes your hair feel softer than without it, so for the super cheap price it is worth it.",3
"After getting gel nails at a salon and paying a ton for them, I ended up purchasing my own supplies on Amazon.  This light is great for all types of polish.  When I polish my 10 yo nails, even regular polish will last for at least a week, if not more, thanks to this light.  Without the light, we were lucky to get through one day.  Shipping was great, and all arrived in working order.",5
"my hair is dry,natural wavy,fine colored hair, after shampooing my hair the 4th time my hair felt heathy,. it did, it wasn't dry looking anymore, my hair seemed to hair body in it,the color I paid to have in it was more translusent,my hair was easir to comb and style, I love this shampoo,it actually did what it said, put mosturre back in my hair made me feel younger, thank you for a true honest product..you'll love this shampoo,.. give it a try...what do u have to lose?",4
"I really like this product. No, it's not an injection. I agree the marketing is a bit confusing. You will NOT get the results of an injected product with a topical product. So you have to have realistic expectations. That said, Argireline can reduce motion and softens wrinkles. (Reduce, not completely freeze or eliminate.)I've reordered this product and don't want to be without it! I bought it because of the 20% Argireline. I can't afford Botox and would rather skip the injections. It may take a while to ""build up"". I think I noticed results after a couple weeks. I use the product only on my forehead and I layer applications. This product is a bit thick and feels sticky at first, but it soaks in quickly and very cleanly. So I put one layer on my freshly washed face and let it dry. I add another thin layer and let it dry. Sometimes I'll add a third layer just focusing on the forehead ""11s"". Then I can put moisturizer over. This is all for a.m. application, and keep in mind that I have very strong ""frown muscles"". It doesn't completely freeze my forehead, but it definitely softens the ""frownies""!!! I honestly notice a difference.Though I do multiple applications, I do only focus on my forehead, so one bottle still lasts a couple months. I use Porcelain Skin's Skin Firming Activating with DMAE, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic AcidB00A7LPEMGon the rest of my face.With these products, as well as alternating Tretinoin cream and a glyocolic cream at night, my skin is looking good!",5
Not really impressed. It's too small and hard to get it all out of the tube. I've switched to Coastal Scents primer which is just as good as Urban Decay but costs considerably less and is easier to squeeze out of the tube.,3
"An ulta store recently opened up where i live and i bought this nyx eye shadow primer at the nyx section. i tried it shortly after i bought and WOW, this is another amazing primer. my eyeshadow stayed put and didn't smudge and crease and since this is another reasonably priced eye primer i'm now in love with, there's no need for me to shell out $30 for an eye primer.",5
These work great. I mean I didnt have to buy the Konad brand but I do like it and use it a lot,5
"I usually use Nivea for Men products when I wash my face.  I gave this Dove face wash a try to see how I'd fare with a competitor's product.  In all, it cleans well, but I'm not thrilled with the fragrance.The product comes out of the tube as a white creme.  It washes well and rinses easily, leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed, not stripped or dry.  I give it high marks as a daily face wash in that respect.However, it smell almost exactly like the Dove bars that my wife uses, a sort of perfumey, floral scent.  I don't know why Unilever decided to use that fragrance in a man's face wash.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not as though it leaves you smelling like perfume afterwards.  But, when you're washing your face, it's like sticking a Dove body bar under your nose.  That isn't exactly something that I look forward to in the morning when I'm waking up, especially coming from the more refreshing scents I'm used to in the Nivea for Men products.I'd recommend this for its cleaning properties, but make sure you can stomach the fragrance.",4
"Decent quality brushes for the price.  I've been using them for a few weeks now and don't notice any stray brush hairs in my make-up which is always nice.  I bought this mainly for the eye brushes, specifically the angle brush which I use to apply a very nice, narrow line of cream eyeliner into my lashline.  It's works great.",4
"I've been using this foundation for a few years now, I generally like the way it looks on my face but it has a way of making it into the wrinkles on my forehead if I don't apply correctly or too much. They really stand out, with out or without primer, bb cream does a better job than primer, and it's not like my wrinkles are visible without make up, all I have are 3 lines on my forehead, this plus powder make them oh so obvious, thats why the 3 stars. It does do what it says it does as far as the looking good in any light and in pictures and I do keep buying this product, and I will try the other things in the photo ready line. If you have fine lines on your face I don't think you'll like this foundation.",3
"I'm 55 and have had acne for my entire adult life. Unfortunately, adults get left behind in the acne product market. This is a terrific daily skin wash that does not dry out my skin. I've used it for a few days and I'm absolutely sold on its efficacy as well as its ability to do its job and not strip me of all my much needed moisture.I highly recommend this to any adult who is looking for a daily wash product for acne prone skin. The best product I've tried; I'm very pleased with it.",5
"After lugging my full-size dryer on a trip this past weekend, I decided it was time to look for a travel dryer again. Found this one here and just received it. What a surprise! It's like a mini version of my full-size dryer, same heat settings and nearly the same blowing power. The product description omits what the instruction guide says, which is that it's 1000 watts. But don't let that fool you. I just returned an 1875-watt Conair model that I purchased at Target; this little BaByliss is far superior. Blows very well and has better heat. Plus, it's tiny! It seemed to me that the little red BaByliss sold here on Amazon is even smaller, maybe too small, so I chose this model. It's still smaller than I expected, but it will work fine. I've had travel dryers before, but never one like this BaByliss. It costs more than many others listed here, but it's well worth it to me if it does a good job on my hair and fits neatly in the suitcase.",5
"Is this a moisturizer with sunscreen or a sunscreen with moisturizer? I wasn't sure. The drug facts and directions make it clear it is a sunscreen which should be reapplied every two hours. I am not accustomed to using moisturizer that frequently so I called customer service. They told me that it was a moisturizer with sunscreen and the package reads the way it does due to FDA regulations regarding sunscreen.So I pumped some of the thick, white cream out of the container and applied it. It goes on smoothly but has a fragrance that reminded me of baby shampoo. It did linger but was not overwhelming although I prefer unscented products.I think this is a terrific sunscreen with its generous SPF 30. However it failed as a moisturizer. My skin actually felt drier than before. Nor did I observe improvement in the remaining six of seven signs of aging. The expiration date on my container was 09/2015.Olay generally makes good skin care products. I did like the consistency and the high SPF. The pump bottle is cute, a bit chubby but still appealingly modern. It protects the product from contamination which is a definite plus. But for whatever reason, my skin appears to be resistant to its moisturizing properties. That makes it a no for me.",3
"Can't wait to use these! They are such pretty little pearl like gems in different sizes. Not very many in each side but for the price, it's good. You do have to wait a long time for delivery but they still came before last day promised.",4
"Throw away your curling iron and the burns that accompany it! The heat stick curls hair, never burning it or you. Even those of us who are all thumbs when it comes to this sort of thing can achieve dramatic results. Buy this!!",5
"They may look nice but don&#8217;t be fooled. They are not soft in fact they are stiff and itchy, and they shed, the bristle fall out all over your face.",1
"I know the price isn't that expensive, however for this flimsy piece of fabric, I expected a little more quality to it. Also, the back looks like the dye wore off in some spots.",2
"This product dries fast and maybe works, but I am not wiling to give it more timeas my nails, especially the white part of my nails turned like a very light yellowish or tanish color.It definitely did something to my nailsI am sticking to my original hard as nails solution",1
"Ooooo how silky my winter skin is!!!  This is by far best non-greasy healing lotion!  Faintly smells, so my hubby can use it on his mechanic dry, cut, split, hands as well.  I use it EVERYDAY when I get out from the shower, from neck to tip toe!  With no build-up, I always look forward to my next session with it!  I faithfully massage it in nightly as well and it helps my skin feel smooth as a babies bottom and I still feel extremely soft after a shower! Such a quality product. I highly recommend it! I can't wait to see what it does to my skin in the summer after a long day at the pool! Amazon offers an incredible value!",5
"I am a makeup beginner and these brushes helped me in my journey to more daring things, like wearing foundation. They are very soft and easy to use. Very well made. I would recommend these to anyone who is not able to buy one single brush for 35 dollars (like me).",5
wow i really liked this product..i never paid much attention to my eye brows but all my friends were using it...i was surpassed how much it high lighted my eyes,5
"I was looking at another product for covering up thinning hair and a reviewer suggested this product instead. It's cheap and tiny so it was definitely worth a try. I have used it twice and both times I thought it did a good job of covering up the shiny scalp areas and making the thinning areas look fuller. I also thought my oily hair wasn't oily while using this item. I think the type of brush you use is critical here. I couldn't find anything that I currently own nor at the store so I just used my razor's cleaning brush to apply, which worked fine. I am going to try other brushes to see if I get better results since I want a darker or more intense effect. Now, I have natural dark brown hair, but I currently have highlights going on so my hair is different shades all over. This is a dark brown so it just looks like my roots are a little lighter than they are. I am tempted to try the black color to see if that gives me the intensity I want. Overall, no one seemed to give my hairline a second glance and it made me feel more confident and...isn't that what's important here? Two thumbs up!",5
"Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave Original, 3 fl oz, definately makes an annoying choir a little easier. I've never been a huge fan of electric razors, because I haven't found any brand that gives me as good a shave as I get from even a cheap blade. Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor. Williams Lectric Shave allows me to get a smoother shave when using an electric, but its smell, while not offensive, is almost overpowering.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.",3
"By the time I towel dry, the scent is gone.  Will probably try another scent next time.  Probably would not recommend it.",3
"I use grape seed oil on my hair mix with a few other oils mix with three small drops of neem oil use it for my natural hair. I also use grape seed on my body, it gives you a natural looking glow and it help your skin become solf and sooooooo smooth good stuff. Do it the natural way well ya.",5
"The brushes, bowl and combs all work fine. As others have said, the clips are so-so, but you can buy a cheap pack of clips for $5 or less to go with it and you'll be fine. I'm usually a lazy hair-dyer but when I do have the time and patience to do it the &#34;right&#34; way, even with this cheap kit, it drastically improves the appearance of your hair coloring. I would recommend this if you want something cheap and useful to aid in your at-home hair salon adventures.",4
This is a great spray to keep hair moist and lessen frizzy hair in a dry environment with furnaces going constantly in the cold. It smells nice and it works.,5
M57 is the Konad plate I use most often. The Leopard and Zebra print designs are so versatile and depending on your color choices can really make your nails POP or give them a super chic textured look. The fishnet design is very nice as well but I don't think it's as easy to wear as the other two. I only give this plate four stars though because I don't really use the other designs,4
"Needed a little something extra this Winterfor dry skin and have just discovered a newall-around moisturizer! This product is verylight and seems to work best on my face ...Its also non-greasy, so if you need a littleextra layer, the skin absorbs it very well ...I'm adding this to my daily Winter routine!",5
I purchased this hand soap based on the rave reviews but I don't see anything special about it.  I think it cleans well but the scent is somewhat &#34;fake&#34;.  I don't like it.  I may try other scents.  I prefer hand soap from Bath & Body Works.,2
"Self-adjusting providing an even REALISTIC tan. Very faint fake tanner smell, if any. Black-green colored thick lotion helps with application.",5
"My college-age daughter has dark brown hair which she has professionally dyed platinum blonde.  She wears it in a cute short spiked-type style which she achieves by blowing dry and straightening.  And as an active young woman, she sweats and washes her hair often, sometimes even twice a day.  So her hair goes through a lot.She has been using this deep conditioning mask for a month now.  She says it's the best product she has ever used to keep her hair soft and shiny, and to help protect against split ends and dry scalp.  She says that the mask is easy to use, and she likes that it has no scent.  She says that she likes wearing her perfumes, and doesn't like her hair products to interfere with their scent.  She uses the product just about every time she shampoos unless she is really pressed for time.  She says that her hair has never looked better.  She asked me to send her the Tresemme Renewal Shampoo and more of this conditioning mask before she runs out, so I know that she really likes it.  It may be a tad pricy for a college student's budget, but for what it does, I think the price is worth it.Recommended.",5
I saw a product similar to this on &#34;Shark Tank&#34; and thought it was brilliant. Most of my makeup/foundation is in glass bottles and I can never get all of it out. This lil guy does the job! I love it :),5
"I've tried many toners and I have to say I love this product!  After cleansing my face, I apply with cotton swabs and my skin feels so great!  In addition, there is no overwhelming smell.  Once again, Olay lives up to their own standard of quality products . .",5
Perfect size and shape for nail art. Shipment was awesome stay on along time with uv polish or gel and super glue form own personal experience. Will buy more in the future.,5
The 24 acne free system did not work for me like I would have hoped. Made my face very dry and then it burned and it broke out even more. Will not be buying again.,2
"This oil is great for hot oil treatment after washing hair. My beautician loves it. If using daily only use a little, fragrance can be a little strong if use to much. I would recommend this product.",5
"I really like this powder! it goes on smooth, stays on, not heavy, and it looks really well, the shade matches and blends well, I can wear it with or without foundation, and it still covers well, and looks very nice. I have already ordered more of this product! I have been using it for a few weeks, along with some other age rewind products, im not sure if the age rewind works other than on the under eye product, which I have used a lot longer, and can say that I can tell a difference in that area, but I am telling a slight difference in my skin, and it doesn't break my skin out, which a lot of products do, which is great, and I really like the way my skin is now, so I do recommend this product!",5
"This product is light and not greasy but provide your hair just the right amount of moisturizer. Make sure when using this product, you completely rubing into your scalp for the best results.",5
"I have never used a body wash, but got this when I bought some other Oily products. I used it and it is wonderful, the smell is fab and may skin feels so great and smooth. Even though I moisturize right after my bath, this seems to have made my skin even nicer.Love it.",5
"I have used this styling product for years!It works really well even with my fine hair, just use a little.Great for Thick hair too, just use more!",5
"This is an update to a previous review. I use this product between my eyebrows and on the side of my nose, which gets a crease because I sleep on my side. I love this product because it's so easy and it really works! I cut these in half down the middle - the full size is actually a little large for between my eyebrows and would sometimes take a hair or two when removed. Occasionally, there is adhesive residue left on my forehead - but it washes easily off. (This is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.) But I'm elevens- and crease-free. So simple. I have these on automatic reorder and have been using them for over a year (I'm 38). I am disappointed in the creeping cost increase of this product. When first started using these, they were about $15 but now over the last year or so, they've been incrementally rising the price to close to $20. That is frustrating and annoying.",4
"This was the first BB cream I ever tried. I've never been able to keep up with a makeup regime because the day after I put on foundation, I always break out. I chose this BRTC BB cream because the label said it was designed for oily, troubled skin&#8212;which is exactly what I have. This product did not make me break out. However, it does nothing to control oil, and ends up looking cakey. BB creams don't come in many colors, but because they &#34;oxidize&#34; after 10-15 minutes on your skin, they shouldn't look unnatural. This one does. I'm fair-skinned with slight yellowish undertones, but this BB cream sat on my face like a mask. Seriously, I'm really pale&#8212;I hate being in the sun, and this stuff STILL looks too white on me.Moreover, it does NOT photograph well! I wore this to a family gathering and in every photo, it looked like I'd applied my grandma's pressed powder in a sauna.Instead of this stuff, I recommend Skin79's Hot Pink BB Cream. If you have oily skin, you still might need to blot your face in the afternoon. But the Skin79 stuff is smoother and spreads much more easily, and still doesn't make break out despite also having sun protection (which the BRTC one does not have).",1
"I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!",4
"I know there is an expression, ""I'm speechless"" but "" I'm wordless"". This is so splendiferous and fun. I just put one coat over a China Glaze gold glitter. It gave my nails such beautiful demension with all different colors subtly sparkling. This looks wonderful over most any color if you like glitz which by now you know I obviously do. Take a chance, it is truly silver splendor. Will brighten up purple, red, pink , copper and let your imagination run wild. Have fun and enjoy.",5
This is a good lip stain it lasts a long time. I am fair complected and this color is good for me.,5
"The Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-in Conditioning Foam truly lives up to its name! This is my first Nexxus product, and I love it! The product is definitely weightless, and it's also super moisturizing. In addition to being weightless and moisturizing, it detangled my hair. I washed my hair in the shower and sprayed it on, and the comb glided through my hair. This leave-in is one of my new staples!",5
I've always used this for my hair and my wigs leaves them silky and smooth will always use this product love it,5
This is a great product but it's way to thick for me. I end up mixing some water with it so it's not so thick.,4
"I have purchased several Suave Professionals products and have really experienced great success with them.  I have also tried the WHOLE line of the Suave Professionals Macadamia line.  I really like the weightless and oil free performance of this oil. It is great for fine hair and doesn't leave an oily residue or weight your hair down.  I like to spray the product DIRECTLY into my hands and then run my fingers through my hair.  I have short hair and use three pumps into my hands.This is also great to use when you blow dry your hair or use any heat implements to style your hair.  All in all, a GREAT product at a great price!",4
"This lipstick was a great price for the product.  The color is a pretty pink, and it is very matte.",5
This brush is PERFECT for blending and getting beautiful looks. Super soft just like my other Sigma brushes and is a must have in anyone's collection!,5
"Okay, so I'm not a fan of fake lashes or having to put on fake lashes but I found these to be relatively easy to put on and take off. There were no embarrassing mishaps like lashes falling on my nose and they Don't look unbelievably fake. I wear them on dress up days and they make me look sexy(ier). Great price, nice looking and easy to put on. Who could ask for more out of fake eye lashes?",4
Super nice color. Love how it has a tiny bit of sparkle. I like the darker brown also and use it as an eyeliner. Love it.,5
"I figured the protective glove would actually be... I don't know... protective? It's just a regular thin glove, and you can't touch the styling iron for more than a second or two or it burns anyway. That said, I forged ahead and attempted to get the bouncy waves promised to me by the ads...I have very long, medium texture hair. I blew it dry and then used this styler to try to make it wavy. It was tricky to use and I felt very awkward trying to get my hair wrapped all the way around in figure 8s. I did the best I could, in approximately 1 inch sections as it advises, and what I ended up with was just weirdly inconsistent, sort of ""bent"" hair that looked like a combo of bedhead and windblown beachy. Not at all attractive.I know this whole double-prong thing is a new trend, but I don't get it. Maybe if I spent hours fooling around with this trying to get it juuuust right, I might end up with more consistent waves, but I don't have that kind of time to waste, and I'm not convinced the end result would be anything special anyway. Back to conventional curling irons for me.",2
"Fit my olay spin brush and is not generic. Bristles protected by packaging in their original box, so no bent bristles.",5
"I was looking for a gentler toner, and this is it. It works well and I really like the smell. I have had a couple of people comment on how good I smell after using it. And it not an overpowering smell, just a light rose scent.",4
"I never liked this kind of 'effects' in a nail polish. I thought it looked messy. However, I loved this polish. It's a great product for a great price.",5
"what a variety! the designs are so beautiful and of such good quality!i love them ALLlol I lack fingernails now, i wanna try them all! XD!they all are so stylish and beautiful, it works perfectly with the most basic kit of konad stamp and scrapperI didnt buy the base to hold the disc, I didnt consider it necessary, and i was right, it isnt necessaryit works perfectly just like it is!little, handy and easy to store! they weight almost nothing, and I dont get why it has some bad reviews. Its a really good buy, in my opinion, this set is pure win - it comes out a lot more cheap than to be buying each plate one by one separatelyi am SO happy with my purchase I may order again as gifts to my girlfriends!",5
some review said the smell is awful but I find it delightful. since it's milky so no harsh rubbing but medium exfoliating result,5
"I cannot get enough of Shany's Makeup Brushes with the Make up Apron.They are so cute and handy! Perfect for on the go or wannabe teen makeup artists like myself. The Apron is perfect, I feel so professional!",5
"This serum works great! My skin drinks it in and I have *finally* seen some wrinkle reduction after years of using expensive &#34;wrinkle&#34; creams. The ingredients are high quality and mostly natural. But you should pay attention to the directions. I didn't and I did run into some problems.I started to see an improvement in hydration within the first day or two. I had a ton of dry patches from winter and they were gone right away. Then I saw an improvement in the color of my skin - less splotchy pink sections. That was about it for 2 weeks, except that I noticed an increase in acne.The product is all natural and noncomedogenic so it didn't make sense. I had stopped using all my other products so I could see what if any results were from the vitamin c serum. After a few more weeks, I noticed my skin was getting thicker and that &#34;maybe&#34; some of my wrinkles were becoming more shallow. But the acne got worse.I wanted to keep using the product because I have never seen an improvement in wrinkles from any of the products I've used and I wanted to keep going. So I did keep going. The acne stayed, the wrinkles improved.Then I started to think about my acne. I have had acne since I was a teen and into my 30's. Then it went away when I started using retinols. They never budged my wrinkles but did clear up my acne beautifully. I had stopped using the retinol cream when I started the vitamin C serum.So I re-read (instead of just skimming) the directions. I was applying the vitamin C morning and evening. The recommendation was to apply it in the morning, let it soak in, then apply your usual lotions. In the evening, use your other regular products. Hmmm...So I started using the Vitamin C only in the morning, and added my retinol cream back in the evening. The acne cleared up very quickly (days) and the results seem to keep getting better in the wrinkle battle.I don't know that I'll ever have 20-something skin again, but I am VERY, VERY happy with the improvement.",5
"Someone once described this as a warm spicy creamsicle. And it totally is. It's very spicy but has a creamy base with orange to it. Doesn't last all day, but majority of the day",5
required for all crafting and cake paintinggreat for christmas and other holiday art that require fine touches.  this is what i have been looking for.,5
"You know how your nails won't dry because the coat was too thick? Not with this! I applied one coat like the instructions said, a thick one, mind you and it still dried. What I loved the most: NO blanket prints in the morning! I'm definitely buying this again and I'd recommend TopSpeed to anyone.",5
"I like the fragrance.  It's a bit ""potent"" but that's fine for me.  I like the design of the bottle, and the face that the cap is on the bottom, which makes a lot of sense.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks.  It's supposed to not dry your skin out so much, and I guess that's probably the case.  I've used some body was that was too astringent, but this one is fine. It states that it's both body and face wash.  I don't personally use it on my face, as I use a separate face wash for that.  Overall I like this body wash more than many I've used, and the price is right also.",5
I'm only giving this 4 stars because &#34;brown&#34; isn't really my color. This can pass for the days when I want something that really looks just &#34;gold&#34;.,4
"For me it's always the conditioner rather than the shampoo that determines how good (or bad) my hair feels and looks. Pretty much any shampoo that gets my hair clean and doesn't stink is fine, as long as I have a good conditioner. This shampoo works great for me when used with the conditioner that goes with it. It gets my hair clean with just a small amount.  With this shampoo, my hair doesn't require the &#34;rinse and repeat&#34; step, but if you have oily hair your results may vary. The fragrance is lovely and not too strong, and it doesn't linger. Definitely not overly perfumed.I've tried three different shampoos and conditioners in this Suave Professionals Natural Infusion line, and have had excellent results with all of them.",5
"Well layered, it is curly and thick! The bangs are sided and the color is a beautiful light brown! It is VERY wavy and a little curly, easily gets frizzy however. The only complaint I have is that the cap is a little tight for me and gives me headaches. Overall, it is nice and super long!",4
"Fast delivery, product as described.  These came packaged and brand new!  I love all the different designs and they were a great deal for all the plates you get.",5
"Be careful with this brand, even though they state they are natural and contains no glycols. This product does contain glycols which they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components. Please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn't contain all natural ingredients.",1
"I MIX THIS WITH MY MOISTURIZER, JUST A COUPLE OF DROPS.  LOVE HOW IT FEELS AND ALSO TAKES SHINE AWAY FROM FACE WHILE KEEPING IT MOISTURIZED.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN.",4
"First off, be warned that this product is extremely shimmery, even for a champagne color.However, it's very pretty and elegant on the lid. It does show up quite well even without a primer. It doesn't clump up or anything. I like to just dust it over a base for a subtle sparkle to my eyes, but it can easily be worn as a regular shadow too. I also use it to highlight my inner corners since white looks a bit harsh against my warm toned skin.",5
I purchased this some time ago when the Holland collection first came out. Thanks A Windmillion is a gorgeous dusky green-blue. The formula is great. This entire collection is pretty awesome and I think I will be picking up a few other colors from it.,4
"At first I loved the GHD flat iron.  It was comfortable to hold, heats in a flash, and did a great job of styling my hair.  However, after about three months of using it I started noticing my hair breaking.  I had some minor breakage while combing and blow drying, but as soon as I use the GHD IV flat iron my hair snaps off all over the place.  No amount of anti-snap or thermal heat protectors has improved the situation.  My sink is full of snapped off hair, and I have very fine thin hair, so this has caused a huge concern.  I'm not kidding I think I have only half my hair left.  When my stylist uses his flat iron my hair does not do that.  The conclusion I'm coming to is that the lack of heat control is a big problem.  I'm buying another flat iron but one that has temperature control.",5
"I love this product.  Makes my hair feel soft.  Not sure it is really mending split ends, though.  I just like using a light leave in conditioner instead of a cream rinse.",5
"I just love this LED lamp; it is so easy to use and does everything for you.  The timer is accurate and goes off automatically when time is up.  The lamp is small and therefore, takes up less space (which I am limited on).  The lamp is made well, is pretty to look at and works like a charm. And, there is more than enough room inside this lamp for all 4 fingers at once and some wiggle room too.  I really like that feature as some lamps I viewed looked very small inside.  I would 'highly' recommend you try this lamp; you will not be disappointed.",5
"I tried both the Shine and Color Care conditioner from this new Suave line.  The smell is fantastic - spicy and a bit exotic.  The problem is the oils they use.  At the Suave price point, one can assume there is only a very small amount of the advertised Argan oil, as that is very expensive.  So, this product has coconut oil and mineral oil, which appear to be the 2 main conditioners.  I first tried the Color Care and like the result on my hair - soft, smooth, and shiny.  The problem?  The type of oil used in the product has made my shower floor very slippery. I don't know if it is the coconut oil or the mineral oil, but after using this product, the next time I got in the shower, I almost fell because the floor was slippery. This has never happened to me before (the shower floor is even textured) and the only difference was the introduction of this product into my routine the day before.I tried the Shine conditioner soon after with the same result.  Soft and shiny hair, dangerously slippery shower floor.",3
i did receive the product but have not used it as yes as i am trying to us the set that i have now,4
"Okay, here's the deal; you take the rich, creamy and luminescent white cleanser formula, wrap it up in a posh-looking package design and change the price tag from $6.42 to $30...okay, $15.  Will it sell?  Yes, Pond's cleanser looks and feels that good!Of course, what really matters is the contents itself, and, that considered, I especially like that the exfoliating beads in the cleanser are so subtle that they easily wash off my face--and not, like most of the other exfoliating cleansers that I've used--get caught in my eyes--not a good feeling!As far as scent goes, contrary to what many of the other reviewers say, I smell a delicate, non-intrusive aroma that accentuates the product. Yes, Pond's leaves my face super clean, and knowing that the cleanser will not clog my pores is an added perk. As far as long-lasting results, I think my skin is just as ""renewed"" and ""luminous"" as before I used this Pond's product...at my age, I do not expect any miracles from any product, regardless of what skincare manufacturers promote or promise.Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/JournalistAuthor: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE",4
"Absolutely love these. I have bought several in order to swatch my ever expanding nail polish collection and found that they work fine with both regular polish and gel polish alike.The fact that these swatch sticks are clear is awesome - I have used one entire set just to swatch various topcoats. By doing this, I can easily stack swatches one on top of the other in order to see exactly what a certain top coat will look like over a certain nail polish.One of the best bits of advice that I can offer is to paint the underside of the swatch sticks as opposed to the top. By doing so, you will avoid the polish chipping off after time and also painting the underside makes it easy to tell what matte polishes will look like when topcoated simply by looking either at the bottom or the top of the swatch.I did end up taking the bolt out and replacing it with a large binder ring in order to make it a bit easier for me to arrange them to my liking and add new swatch sticks in when necessary. This worked perfectly, and I am very happy with my newly swatched collection!",5
"My hair type is fairly normal (naturally), however I highlight it blonde and also wear hair extensions.  This conditioner works wonders on my own damaged ends and keeps my extensions hydrated. This is the only conditioner I will use when I am wearing extensions, as it is the only condition that has ever restored the moisture in the ends of my hair extensions to make them look like the day I bought the hair! When I use it on my own hair, without the extensions, my hair is extremely silky and is noticeably healthier looking.I tried this product several years ago after experimenting with other deep conditioners...Kerastase, Redken, and Neutrogena. They each worked okay for me, but my hair was still quite dry.The condition is very thick, but doesn't weigh the hair down. Its best to use it on the bottom half of your hair, keeping it away from the roots unless you have extremely dry hair all the way to your scalp. The only time I apply it to my hair from root to end is the first shampoo after I get my hair colored.I recommend using it every other shampoo if your hair is pretty damaged. You won't notice any buildup or weight if you use it every shampoo, though.The tub of conditioner is huge, so don't let the price intimidate you.Worth every penny. It lasts forever, and I probably use more than the average person.The scent? Unique, and not too strong. Almost like a minty strawberry.Strongly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to restore moisture in their hair.",5
"I had seen Lanza products at my hair salon, but they were too expensive.  So I came to my Amazon and found the same leave-in conditioner for a fraction of what the salon charged.  I apply just a dime-size amount and work it through my hair with my fingers and a comb.  My hair damage is from blow drying and flat ironing...this product is repairing the frizz with each use and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Will continue to use it and recommend it to others who suffer from damaged hair.",5
"I bought this product along with the Godefroy eyebrow tattoos. Although the product is easy to apply, I found the product too light for my dark brunette brows so I still need to use an eye pencil.",3
"My hair: long, curly (3b), very dry and fine (i.e., I need some weight from my curl creams to control frizz & make my hair more vertical than pyramid shaped). This product is not a multi-tasker for me.  It did give nice definition under a gel, but added no moisture or weight to my hair. It also did zero as a 2nd day hair product, which is something I really look for in a cream. The consistency has very little 'slip' and is not silky or rich, but the feel is not unpleasant. More like a lotion than a cream to me.I bought this to replace Cantu Shea Butter Repair Cream, which is very rich & heavy, but doesn't add a lot of curl definition for me, and Fructis Leave In Cream, which does, but doesn't provide much weight. Both of these work very well for me on dry 2nd day hair. For the price & performance, I think either of these products are a better choice.",3
Usually this is the only thing that I have to put on my face at night after washing. I have very dry skin If I do not use this. I have used it every morning and night for about two months now & I have noticed that my skin is smoother and healthier looking. I also use it on a cotton ball as a makeup remover because it is good for sensitive skin yet effective. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!,5
Oh my god look at all these colors! And it's only 10 bucks! I like to change up my eyeshadow a lot and I'm not made of money so I got this bad boy. They go on smooth and if you use eyeshadow primer they look really vibrant. People think I'm wearing MAC or Urban Decay.,5
"I regret buying this. I'm 25 years old and notices I'm starting to get worry lines on my forehead, so I bought these hoping to do some proactive damage control. I don't want them to get worse. While these did relax my worry lines, I still think these things are terrible and a waste of money. Here's why:When you wake up, you'll have new lines from where your skin was pushed up against the edge of the frownies. Yes, they fade away after 20 mins, but this is how wrinkles form, over time you keep your skin in the same position and eventually it becomes a wrinkle. I don't want to use these products and then over time get NEW lines!They are hard to stick on and feel uncomfortable. The first few times you remove them, it's going to take hair with it, and it hurts.I wish I knew what the adhesive was made out of. You will feel a tingle and numbing sensation the first hour is is on. This worries me because idk what the glue is made of.Finally, these things aren't cheap. I was planning on using these daily to prevent further wrinkles, but they aren't cheap and they aren't good.I found another product that works better and it's cheaper! Medical tape. I use 3 pieces on my forehead every night. I don't wake up with new lines and it sticks easily without coming off or pulling my skin when I remove it. It's cheap, and I don't have to worry about what glue they use. I don't even feel them when I'm going to bed. Seriously, just go to the store where the first aid kits are, find the medical tape and have fun.",1
"I have been watching Samantha Schuerman on Youtube for a while, and she is always talking about how fabulous this brush is. So I decided to give it a try. I must say it is absolutely AMAZING. It's by far the best brush I have ever purchased. It makes my foundation look flawless. I will definitly purchase more items from Sigma.",5
Goes on smooth and perfect color. Just what I was looking for. Also good pricing and lots of other colors.,5
"The color is very nice, but the gold sheen is a bit much.  As a redhead, I have to be conservative in makeup choices.  Would be good if the glitter/sheen were reduced.",3
l wanted the wig in the picture the length and the curl was wrong and the color was off l wanted that one but the one l got is ok l wouldn't trade it back but l wanted the one in the pic,3
"I have been searching for a while for a decent shampoo & conditioner for color treated hair until I found Pureology Hydrate. Shampoos I've used in the past have really faded my hair not long after I've been to the salon. I was skeptical when I bought this because I wasn't sure if it would be worth it, but I figured I'd give it a try after having my hair colored back in December. Needless to say, I love this stuff and think that it's definitely worth the price. I got my hair colored from blonde to dark brown in December and it's just now starting to fade a little bit, which says a lot since I live in Hawaii and am out in the sun almost every day.  Although it's expensive for only 8.5 oz, it doesn't really take that much shampoo or conditioner to get your hair clean when you wash it, so the bottles last you a while. I'm so happy I finally found a shampoo/conditioner that hold in my hair color for longer. I definitely recommend Pureology!",5
"I have been using these for years (since I read Bo Derek stating in a post ""10"" interview that she used them to keep her skin smooth :-)).  As my skin has aged, I have switched from the regular to the gentle version.I have sensitive skin that doesn't like harsh chemicals.  Using these allows me to slough off the older layers as well or better than expensive exfoliants.  They helped control acne and now remove the old skin that keeps me from having the ""healthy glow"" that the commercials for costly creams promise.  It has been difficult to find these locally as the shelf space gets taken by new, expensive options, so I am really glad to find them on Amazon.Inexpensive, re-usable, no chemical reactions or worries about getting something in your eye. Perfect.",5
"Really this was a random purchase. I always wanted hot rollers, but didn't do the research necessary before I purchased. I have long hair and these rollers are too small and too few. I'm not sure if the order slip form it came with to purchase refills is still valid, so I may just have to buy a second set. They work great and do leave a great curl, but I just regret this purchase.",3
"I have yet to find a wonderful eye cream that doesn't cost $100+, this is fine, it has a nice texture and no scent.  It is not too thick for under makeup.",3
"This Suave product cleaned my hair just like the Paul Mitchell product does.  My 50 year old curly, thick longish Irish hair was clean and rinsed out quickly and easily. I do have split ends and while the shampoo did what I expected it to, it is the conditioner (Suave Professionals Split End Rescue Conditioner)that kept my hair from looking a mess. I wish I could say I saw a split end reduction, however I didn't. Then again I wasn't expecting it because if the shampoo has cleaned my hair then it has done it's job.",5
"This is the perfect brush for concealer under eye, blending highlighters , cream blushes etc. Perfect size, and just as soft and nice as others double their price. I have to say I'm a MAC and SIgma brush girl, but this one is in my top 10 brushes",5
"I like it a lot. Covers my dark circle,which i've always had problem with. Does lighten up my face too. Great product.",5
"EXCELLENT! This palette is so versatile, complete and give me many options for an affordable price. I recommend! Great product!",5
I love the smell of this face wash.  It leaves my skin feeling super soft and it's working better on my breakouts than other washes I've tried.  I'm also using it with the oil control moisturizer and I have definitely seen a difference in amount of oil on my face.,5
My mom uses this stuff all the time and loves it! She uses the other products with it and can't say enough about how good it is!,5
"Good product, high dosage, thanks",5
"While I'm not a medical expert and can't comment on the product health wise, I can tell you my experience. I tried the Konsyl for Balance with Psyllium fiber and prebiotic with insulin fiber which is for everyday digestive health. This helps control constipation, diarrhea, colitis and IBS. Since this is already an orange flavor I figured mixing it with orange juice would be a good way to go about trying it. This definitely was a good idea considering I could hardly tell I had added anything at all. As I already said, I can't really comment on the health benefits too much since I hadn't had any recently problems *knock on wood* with my digestive health lately, but I can tell you that it's easy on the digestive system. I didn't get sick or have cramps after using the product, which I'm pretty sure is a good thing. Best part of this product though, if you're pregnant it is safe to use and if you're diabetic it's safe to use as it is sugar free and gluten free! So if you fit in either of those categories this is definitely a product that may be beneficial to you.READ FULL REVIEW: [...]",4
"The price was very nice so I decided to try it. The key is to not really rub it thoroughly into your skin. It dries to quickly. I have very dry skin on my face. Not like flaking pieces, but feels tight or dry especially during the winter. So I just put some on my finger tips and push it into the skin. especially under my eyes. I keep a light thin coating on it to really seal my skin. It smells great and I even put a dab on my 12 month old who had a patch of dry skin on her arm...worked great. I can appreciate the amount you get too. All around I am happy.",4
"aside from the mango lotion. I also feel like the packaging and description is a little misleading. The ingredients aren't very healthy for your skin, lot's of chemicals.",3
Very disappointed in this product. Didn't work for me at all.  The suction was not very powerful.,1
"I really don't see a significant difference in my drying time or moisture retention... I love to use this turban during my hair treatments or when &#34;steaming&#34; my hair though - at least I still look cute when I answer the door or if I need to go into the yard ...... btw - it seems durable, I've washed it several times in the washer and it's holding up well!",3
"I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont' have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets ""crib head"" or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn't thick or thin. This stuff doesn't weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day.",5
I love this product because it smells amazing and can give you instant results. The bottle is 7.4 fl oz and will last a long time because you only need to use a dime size amount.  I love how it glides into your hair and washes away clean leaving it feeling and looking really pretty.  The product is great  for people who have over processed hair as well because of the nourishing effects.,5
I love it for my face and hair. This is great stuff.,5
"For what you pay there really shouldn't be complaints.  They are not OMG amazing, but they are great for certain things.  If you need swarovski quality, I'd suggest looking elsewhere but for projects and a bit of fun these are perfect.",4
"I realize everyone's face is different, so here is my experience with the Hydro 5. The 5 blades and the vibrating feature are nice on paper, but it didn't offer me any advantage in shaving. I still can't use bladed razors on my upper lip because my skin is sensitive in that region. The sharpest/newest razor will tend to drag on the upper lip and cause sensitivity issues, and the same problems occur with the Hydro 5. Instead I use a Phillips Norelco for that region specifically. I can use bladed razors everywhere else on my face and neck.The Hydro 5 seems to clog just as easily as the Schick Quattro. I figured the vibrating feature might jostle some of the hairs loose, but no dice. The Hydro 5 doesn't get close to begin with, and after a few swipes it tends to just gloss over the hairs. I have to constantly clear the blades.What works for me are the inexpensive disposable Gillette Sensor 3 blades. They will easily last a year for me, and not present any problems. I shave on a 1-2 week basis, so that's roughly 20 shaves out of each blade. Even brand new, the Schick Hydro 5 did not work as well as a year old Sensor 3 on my face.Overall: 3/5 stars, did not give a close enough shave on my face. I prefer the Gillette Sensor 3 and a Phillips Norelco. The Braun foil shavers don't work well on my face either. I think it is because I have thick whiskers that tend to clog up most shaving devices.",3
"I just got this today and couldn't wait to try it. My first attempt, I was nervous because it didn't pick up the design so I took a medium file and lightly filed it to remove the smooth shiny surface. Then I wiped it with acetone and tried again-SUCCESS!! I am so thrilled because I have longer nails and larger design nail plates. My other stamper didn't pick up the entire design but this one does! I also love the plastic scrapers because I don't use metal scrapers on my plates because they leave scratches. I was using old gift cards and old credit cards to scrape but now I can use this one and it works great! I am just thrilled with this product so THANK YOU WINSTONIA! I also got a discount coupon with my order for 5% off on one item or 10% off on two items so of course I ordered two more nail stamp sets from you. I will SO recommend this nail stamper to others. Thanks again!!",5
"This hand soap/dish soap works pretty well and makes the kitchen area smell great when in use! Of course I like that its hands off no need to touch it with your dirty hands. A little goes along way and I dont know if its just mine but way to much comes out so its going faster than necessary. Only complaints will be that it need so many batteries, and you cant refill the bottle with your regular dishsoap, also you get squirted allot when working around the sink if you forget to turn it off ;o)",4
"I don't often use a hair dryer because I'm concerned about damaging my hair. I usually let it air dry.Today, however, I had an appointment. I am female and have long, thick hair. It took less than five minutes to thoroughly dry my hair. I used the low heat setting, and it worked flawlessly.In the past when I've bought hair dryers I've gone with lower priced ones. Often they feel cheap. This one doesn't. I also liked that it only had one simple attachment. I know this dryer is marketed toward males, but, trust me, ladies you'll love it.",5
"I love my new HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron, it does an excellent job in straightening hair and the price and packaging was phenomenal (I paid $38.95). It does not curl hair as well as I was hoping but it really is a nice addition to my hair tools.Thank you for such a quick turnaround,~ SkyLee :)",5
"I am shocked at how much I love this wig. I hesitated buying it because of the word Party in the description. I assumed that it would be more of a costume wig, but am I pleasantly surprised!. I think I like this one the best of all. I just got it today (ordered through Amazon Prime is the ONLY way to go) so I haven't worn it outside for a long period yet. It does shed, as do all cheaper wigs, but it looks and feels the most like my natural hair. This wig is the first one I have bought that the bangs are actually a little less blunt, not as heavy as other wigs, so much more natural. I will order a few more of this same wig. If it doesn't last, I will have back ups because this is going to be my everyday go to wig. Thank You Amazon Prime for the fast, perfectly pkg'd delivery. I do want to note that it seems a little smaller than other wigs but certainly not much difference.  Enjoy this, like I know that I will!",5
This black goes on smooth and shiny. It only takes two coats to reach its deep black. To me its a must have for any polish collection. I don't think you can go wrong with Liquid Leather.,5
"My favorite sog off gel brand is CND Shellac, but this UV light can be used for all other brands.  You just have to adjust the timing as needed by brand (i.e. OPI Gel Color- 3 minutes).  From the other reviews I was expecting it to be bigger.  But it's lightweight and appropriately sized for the job.  Be sure to look underneath the unit when you unpack because the bulbs are in a false bottom.  They also need to be seated properly in the bulb fixture inside.  Take your time and fit them in securely.This cuts down my time by half because I can fit both hands and alternatively both feet in the unit.  Considering the time savings and the fact that I can use this for all my gel products, this was the most logical, budget minded choice.  Easily cures my soak off gel.  The timers work well.  Highly recommended.",5
"Used the spray this past Saturday - temperature was in the 80s, sunny (ah, Spring in North Carolina - delightful!), and had to do some outdoor work around the house.The spray went on easily, did not have a heavy smell, and was not greasy at all.  Used the spray on my face and used the Banana Boat Lotion For Men on my face and legs (see my review for that product).I was outside for around 3 hours and did not burn.  Will definitely use this product for this summer around the house, neighborhood pool, and the beach!Recommended.",4
"The NOW brand is reputable and this lemon essential oil is the genuine thing from what I can tell. It has the aroma of fresh lemon citrus, and the label has it at 100% pure. It should be used with caution as it is genuine essential oil. I use it for my hair scalp treatments (dandruff and sebum production regulation) and for soothing my cramps (when used as a blend). Works great!",5
"still haven't figured out how to use this stuff with nail polish, but hopefully i'll figure something out.. i should probably youtube it",2
"My love.Always buy spring, when the winter want to freshen the face. Elastic skin on the face, light, looks healthy.Recommend that all women over 30.",5
"I use this product almost every day. My hair is fine and doesn't take abuse very well. This product helps keep my hair hydrated - but not oily, greasy or weighted down. It is also great for a quick touch up once my hair is dry. It also seems to support the other bumble and bumble styling products. I swear the defrizz works better if I use this first. I don't know about the scalp tingling bit as mentioned on the bottle, but I can definitely live without that.",5
"Okayy well the dotting tools work great but they send you like two of the same size, over all they're cute and they work how they're supposed to so they get 4 stars from me(: plus the price was INSANE",4
The color I got was more of a brownish pink I did not really like it as a nude either. It does not go with my skin tone (which is plain brown) or anything. I would not buy again.,3
"My hubby likes to have a clean-shaven face, life is much more convenient for both of us when he can use a mirror in the shower. For him, it is much better to be able to shower and shave at the same time, making his morning routine go by much faster. For me, I love the fact of not having to clean any hair out of the sink. It's a win win for both of us.The first thing we noticed when we received the ToiletTree LED Fog-less Shower Mirror was the new feature, the lights. Immediately, we knew this would help hubby even more. The shower is in the corner of the bathroom and it is a stand alone shower so it is pretty dim in there. Shaving can be a little risky, since you don't have much light. The mirror does not use suction cups which is a plus, meaning no sliding down, or simply falling off the wall altogether. The mirror requires adhesive which, for our old mirror, lasted well over 6 months and was still going strong. Although, you do have to allow the mirror to stand a full 24 hrs before using, which includes putting the mirror on it. The mirror is super easy to mount and fill with water. With my hubby and I being a foot different in height, it is really nice that the mirror has a tilt action. The shelf is perfect for hubby to set his razor on, plus I love the included squeegee which slides onto the shelf for easy storage. Also the LED has two different light settings, bright & dim, depending on what you need. My hubby couldn't be more content with his new mirror with LED Lighting.",5
"This product brightens, I use it in specific areas. You can't beat the price for the quality.No need to buy a more expensive brand to get same results.",5
i bought it coz i want dark pink but not proper dark colour i wanted to buy redish pink n this is perfect ....,5
"Zia Skin has made an excellent product to wash your face with. This is a near perfect exfoliant that leaves your skin feeling smooth and very clean. If you are a fan of St. Ivy's products, Zia is comparable in use. The price may turn some people off, but overall a great cleanser.Katiebabs",4
"This product is clear, gives more of an opalescent look rather than the sparkly look I expected.  Pretty, but not as noticeable as I thought it would be.",4
"I really dis-like the weight and feel of traditional foundation but I need coverage due to dark circles and uneven skin tone. I take full advantage of using the concealer brush and the kabuki brush for full coverage. I find that the shade I chose was a perfect match, it has good coverage, feels light and is less fussy to put on than regular foundation. I also like that it doesn't make me break out.I only gave it 4 stars because I find that it doesn't last all day. Then again, you reapply it like you would a powder so it's not a big deal.Bottom line is, for me it's good coverage and still manages to be lightweight and look natural. I'm happy with that.",4
CND really gave this product the correct name.  I normally use the CND Shellac system of doing my nails.  Occasionally I do a normal manicure and use this sticky base coat.  It really does help the polish adhere much better than any regular base coat I have used.Don't let the color throw you.  It comes out clear and not green!  The only negative is that it is one of the strongest smelling polish products I have ever used.,5
"I've used lots of different mascaras at varying price points, and I think that Maybelline New York Volume Express Washable Mascara (""The Rocket"") works well for a modest price. With a few quick swipes, it delivers some real color density, which wakes up the look of your eyes. I'm really taken by the noticeable extra length and color without going over my lashes tons of times. This one's a definite keeper. Recommended -- give it a try!",4
"I have this size and the smaller one, I find myself using this larger one so I don't poodle myself out. A little bit of a learning curve with these so you don't burn yourself. Tried to use glove and it was awkward and really only gave you a little more time to pull hand away before getting a nasty burn; not meant to fully protect. All in all, a nice tool.",4
"Aussie Catch The Wave Sprunch Hair Spray is a good, popular-priced product for those of us who find ourselves, whether we like it or not, curly-haired: particularly during the summer, when some of us have just given up on fighting the heat and humidity.  It makes it possible to wear curly hair, while keeping frizz at a minimum, at least for a day.  Or, of course, it's great for those of us who do like that bushy-haired surfer look.  It's easy to use, on wet or dry hair, and does not require the utilization of a damaging hair dryer.  Just spray it on, sprunch the hair up (I've actually always said ""scrunch""), and there you are, bob's your uncle, I get little curls I can manage.",4
"Absolutely the best thing ever. I was skeptical at first, but I bought it anyway hoping for the best. I have used this twice and just bought it a week ago. Noticable difference in my skin. Works wonders on dark spots and fine lines. A must have!",5
I LOVE this product as well as the Renpure brand.I am unsure why other reviews say it does not lather... cause mine lathers really nice.Smells fragrant and clean and can be used as a unisex fragrant.  I purchase another Renpure shampoo for my son thoughI am looking forward to trying their conditioner.,5
"Let me start by saying I don't love this product, but I LIKE it very much.  I use it ONLY on my brow lines as I am 37 years old and they have become more pronounced. In any case, the second ingredient listed on this product is silicone (anything ending with 'ane' or 'one' is a silicone). With that said, the silicone acts as a temporary filler for my lines between the brows.  I went to see a Dermotologist who gave me a prescription for Atralin.  It's a gel that helps acne as well as wrinkles (just like Retin-A).  It really didn't do anything for my wrinkles, so if it's a temporary fix for me (i.e. - silicone) then I'll take it!",4
Liked Wen but not the styling creme  Although not all wen worked good for me Lavender smell was not real,2
"I love the smell and i LOVE LOVE LOVE how my hair feels now! My hair usually frizzes after washing it and even after straightening it but after using Wen it has completely tamed my hair. This product works wonders and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good change. I've struggled a lot with my hair, being mixed and all, but this product has made a difference.",5
Let me start out saying that I'm 57 years old. I got lucky and started using Olay in my 20's. I have also always exfoliated. I have very few wrinkle at all and it's due to products like this along with my Olay moisturizing routine. I can wash the makeup off at night but then I grab this facial brush and I'm still shocked at how much is still left on my face and neck. I only use the cleanser that comes with it once a week due to it having an exfoliating grit to it. I highly recommend this system for a smooth and softer face.,5
"This has been my go to moisturizer for years. It's light but super hydrating. It also smells really nice, and covers up the usual sunscreen smell you usually get with an SPF moisturizer.",5
I have been using this product for several weeks and so far no change but I will keep trying until it runs out.,3
Not really a body washer for me but clarifying shampoo yes it works great i dont know it I will repurchase again its to small.,4
It did not come in that color jar it was white. It smelled like true cocoa butter but it was extra hard... Good buy,5
"I was disappointed because I paid full price in a pharmacy based on the claim that this ""visibly reduces spot size and redness in 4 hours"".  It doesn't.  I tried it a few times on my face and back and the product is the same as any other Benzoyl Peroxide cream.  There are marginal results after a couple days use so I'm not sure if the cream worked or if the zit was going away anyway.  But it does not do anything in 4 hours.  Maybe for some people but definitely not everyone.",2
Cruelty free products are the best! And not too mention the best for sensitive skin since they don't come with a lot of harsh chemicals.  I really like this facial cleanser.  It makes my face feel really clean and fresh without any of the extra added stuff other companies typically throw into these products.,5
"My daughter's thin, curly hair looks messy even when it's just been brushed. But it looks unkempt messy so it needs taming.We tried this out and I was pleased with the results. It took her overly messy hair, added some definition to the curls, some bounce and life and gave her a controlled messy look and the ability to style it a little. It lasts all day but does need to be washed out at night since it leaves so much residue.I also tried it on myself. I really is like ""gum"" and sticks very quickly to your hair. You can run your fingers through it (with care) and use a brush. The more you use a brush, the more it goes out of shape again. It stays pretty stiff throughout the day.This was easy to use and fun to play with. You have to have the right kind of hair and cut to be able to take advantage of this best but it does a good job.",4
I love my coastal scents palette. It is one of my favorite go to palettes. The colors are rich and vibrant. I ordered directly from them and the shipping was fast. I also have some brushes that I bought from them that I love.,5
"I am a woman, and I love Axe products. I was eager to try this new scent. Unfortunately, it is a much more subtle scent and nothing like the original Axe scent.It does a good job of cleaning my face, and it's not horrible, but I much, much prefer the strong, unique Axe scent I'm familiar with.",3
My step daughter is bi racial and these product ended up going into her bin of products.  It helps to maintain the moisture in her hair which easily dries out.  When I used this on my fine hair it just made it greasy and heavy.  I didn't see any Shea in the product ingredients.  I think the pink stuff I bought for her works best at keeping moisture in her hair and keeping her curls pretty and touchable.,3
"I received this product in good condition and on time.  RoC makes good products.  You just have to be aware that this product does contain Retinol, so if you have sensitive skin, use it sparingly or with another moisturizer.",5
"This is awesome I love it, haven't noticed crazy differences but the red little bumps under my eyes seem to be going away. However I read on ewg that dickinsons version is safer and has less chemicals.",5
"Be very careful applying this color.  It will bleed into your cuticles and sides of nails.  Apply a VERY thin coat!  Other than that, great black color :=)",4
"I usually love all things Aveeno for myself and my family. I use Aveeno's Positively Radiant daily moisturizer and it's the best I've ever used! So I was very excited to see the Smart Essentials line from Aveeno & eager to try the nighttime formula. I usually like a nighttime formula that is not too heavy, sticky, nor greasy. This nighttime moisturizer fit that bill. But, unfortunately the fragrance in this product gives me a massive headache that lasts for hours. I have moderate sensitivity to fragrances, and was surprised that this item was so headache-inducing. The scent itself is nice, I would describe it as a concentrated floral/fruit smell. Even if it didn't give me a headache, I don't think I'd be okay going to sleep with such a strongly scented product on my face. I gave it a try several times and ended up throwing it away.",1
"My two girls with medium to long hair had always complaint of brushing their hair.  This brush has solved many of our problems! My kids do not complaint as much.  I use it on a regular basis.  In my house we have replaced regular brushes with these ones.  And as an added bonus, this design is adorable!",5
"Dove Sensitive Scalp shampoo and conditioner is a good 2 in 1 product. It lathers like crazy, has a nice clean scent and leaves my sons' hair feeling so soft and smelling so good. Their hair just feels like silk to the touch after using it.I really love anything from the Dove Men's line.",5
The colors come out just the way the are in the palate! Very bright! Some of the best eye shadows I bought for the price! Thanks Shant cosmetics :)),5
"This lipstick color is very pretty, the color will last and you do not have to keep putting on more thru out the day.",3
Waste of money. Murad works so much better. I believe this is mainly water in the bottle. Will not purchase again.,1
This beautiful set of eyeshadows and blushes gives you variety of colors in such small and unique packagingThe Cube looks like a chocolate boxI have had it for over a year now and no complaintsHad it with me on a trip to vegas and my girls just were amazed by its qualityIt has both shimmer and matt veriety of colorseasy to carry and pack saving you space and timethumbs up for this good dealI recommend this product,5
"Once you start using WEN you will never go back.  If you've never tried it, please check out how to properly use the product in YouTube.  I have color treated hair with highlights that never goes dull, is soft and manageable, and no frizzies!",5
"I love this ""natural"" lipstick and I love the color.  Not a strong smell or taste.  Just a superior product.  I keep one in my purse and one extra at home.  Beautiful color.",5
"Motions At Home Moisture Plus Conditioner With Silicone and Panthenol. This conditioner is recommended for medium to coarse hair textures. If you fall into that category I would highly recommend running out and getting this now. I have searched up and down for the perfect condition to add more moisture to my hair and get rid of that awful dry and brittle feeling. The Motions conditioner does just that and more, I can now wear my hair down naturally curly and it feels soft and is bouncy.",5
"Yes, I love all my Olay products! At age 69 I have used several other brands to compare but always go back to my Olay the best. I always get many compliments on may complexion and I know it has to be in this product as I do work outside gardening and exposed to sun. I always remember to take pride in using this product last thing at night before going to bed.",5
"So for this pretty peach shade, it is right on point. The only thing you have to be careful of is how much you apply because if you don't watch out, you'll look like a 7 year old who just tried on mommy's make up for the first time.",5
"These seemed to work well, I think I just have too much hair because it kept sliding up and eventually would just fall off.",4
"i received a sample from a local salon. i used it with the conditioner and i must say that it really did make my hair thicker. however, i wasted the sample because i had to shampoo my hair twice; it doesn't lather well.i do love the spicy scent and i also like that it's mostly naturally derived, but i have to say the price of the system is quite off-putting. it's a huge expense. however i probably will try the system one time.",4
"I thought it would take forever to straighten my thick and wavy hair with this narrow flat iron but I was wrong. It was went quickly. The iron heats up quickly and gives a nice hot press. The end results is shiny, flat, non -frizzy hair that lasts all day if it is dry and most of the day if it is rainy or humid.There are videos on youtube teaching curling with a flat iron techniques how to curl my hair with this flat iron, which worked well. I have tried it before with a wider iron and got so so results with this iron I got very good results.I'm still practicing but the iron does a good job and it looks like I am replacing my older wider flat iron AND my curling iron with this.",4
"Almost perfect but the last star I'll save for personal preferences. This spray works best when applied to dried hair - it is not intended to be applied to damp hair and then blow-dried which is the way to use most 'volumizing' products. It does a very good job of adding texture and height to roots, but then it causes you to use the hair dryer AGAIN to dry the product after you've already dried your hair. I'm always skeptical of hair products I have not tried - so many do not do what they are advertised for, or add what stylists call &#34;separation&#34; which is basically the stringy look of dirty hair and is only accomplished by using oils. The Cristophe Volumizing spray keeps the greasy look to a minimum and does add volume, but I couldn't see that it added shine.What I liked: this is really great for the &#34;day after&#34; hair, when I've fixed my hair (stubbornly flat, uncurls, non-frizzy, thick but fine, generally fly-away and lifeless) with other products including Paul Mitchell gel, blow drying, sectioning with curling iron along with spraying Suave hair spray on every section as it goes into the curling iron. I use a 1&#34; iron about 18 seconds on each section, along with spray before and after, just to get a lifted, not curly look - just so you know how obnoxiously straight my hair is. Then the NEXT DAY, when the hair is flat from sleeping on it, that is the time for the CRISTOPHE SPRAY TONIC to lift and fluff the roots. The second day, I find I do not have to re-apply the hairspray to get volume and lift.What I didn't like: Having to blow dry a second time. If I use nothing but this product my hair is almost as flat as if I had used nothing. The second day's hairdo is decidedly heavy. Without the CRISTOPHE spray I usually get three days from a hair-do. With it, only two. It refreshes the volume, but adds enough other stuff that my hair cannot go a third day.Sometimes you really need a second-day pick up for your hair, some days you'd rather have a vacation, so I use this stuff for traveling when I've got talks to do on consecutive days.",4
"This is by far my favorite lip gloss. I love NYX products, but this color is perfect. You can wear it all day every day-it completes the look no matter what because it's a great glossy nude with a lot of shine and a little shimmer.",5
"I use this product to refreshen my scalp while in braids, but use it only if I have to because there is a buildup. It does stop itching, but nothing replaces proper washing with water and suds",3
I have a lot of polishes and it's good to know I never have to throw them out. The amount of money this saves you in being able to keep your polishes is so much!,5
"I love my bronzer, just as I expected, recommend this to anyone who wants to achieve a more natural look.",5
"This is a great item to have around the house. I bought it to help with my sons scar. then I realized that it could also be used as skincare. I used it after washing my face and it would be absorbed easily. It did feel a little greasy at first, but I just had to make sure I didn't use too much. A small amount really goes a long way. This is great to keep skin hydrated and soft. Would recommend to others!!",5
"must be used in conjunction with the day cream to see how it helps the skin,it gives it a glow in the morning.",5
"Pond's face cleanser is decent. If you don't have anything else and you just need to use something for a day or two, by all means use this. But daily use isn't the best in my opinion. Compared to other brands I don't find my face as clean as I did with them. Each person is sure to have differing opinions on face washes but Pond's hasn't ever left my face...refreshed. I feel as if I could keep washing my face and continue to get more stuff off it.As I said though, as a single use every so often this is a perfectly fine product. It does work better when used with exfoliating pads though. Don't forget those. Overall, you could do better but you could definitely do worse.",3
The product does a poor job of eliminating dark circles or concealing fine lines. Moreover it leaves behind white powdery traces. I do not recommend this product at all.,2
What can I say this is great conditioner. People always notice my gray/silver hair. They always tell me how great it looks. Shinny and no yellowing. If you got to have gray hair you might as well make it work for you.,5
"Smells good, lathers-up well, and deep cleans with some type of little abrasive.Can't go wrong with this soap, it even contains moisturizers which keeps your skin well-maintained.But the best is... That lovely clean smell which is distinct yet not overpowering in the least.",5
most of these are the same point on the end but that is okay so that i can do multiple colors at once. do not clean with acetone though. it made the colors wear off of the handles.,5
"I uses this product after peels, around the eyes,  and in the summer for extra moisture after exposure to the sun...  It works for me.  My face looks well hydrated all year around.",4
"Hair one is just like Wen, but at a 1/3 of the price.  I am not a curly girl but I use the tea tree oil for itchy scalp.  It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  Give up suds-ing shampoos and try Hair One!!!!!I have two curly girls (who cowash) and we love this line (they use the olive oil variety).  You should definitely try if you are a curly girl!! Or if you want to get away from stripping shampoos and treat your heal with gentle ness~",5
This is an amazing company which has amazing products!  This product alone is legendary in the making.  It allows the coverage of a tinted gloss with the sweet scent of chocolate.  Great job Shany!,5
"Th Clear Deep Nourishing Treatment mask worked very well for me. When I used it, I made sure I massaged the product into my scalp to see if it helped my itchy scalp. My scalp constantly itches, and the product did give some relief. It gave my scalp a tingly feeling that felt very soothing. This is a very good product that will help lots of itchy scalps.",4
"I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron!  I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year).  The first time I used it it worked great.  The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me.  I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time, it wouldn't even heat up enough to hold a curl.  I think Conair has changed it's product and I will not buy again.",1
I have been using this sunscreen for over a week now every day under my makeup.  I have not had any new breakouts and actually have seen improvement in my skin.  It has the higher SPF that is now recommended.  Softens skins and protects at the same time.  I usually put it on and wait about 10-15 minutes to make sure it is absorbed well before putting on foundation.  Contains 3 different sunscreens to protect from burning and sun damage.  I love how soft my skin is and best of all - acne-free!,5
"I started using Olay Definity after they sent me a sample.  I have a hard time with lotions on my face since most of them feel heavy to me.  This is the best I've found!  It's light and sinks into my skin immediately leaving no residue and doesn't make me feel like my pores are clogged.  This may sound weird, but this is the first lotion that doesn't make my face start sweating after putting it on. (If any other woman has this problem, you'll know what I mean.)I also have tons of freckles on my face that I don't really mind, but Olay Definity started fading them, and I certainly don't mind that either!  I've now been using this product for a year and LOVE IT!",5
I have very coarse thick hair that is also very dry. I am always skeptical when it comes to products that say they can do this or that for your hair.The conditioner is not as thick as those you usually get from other brands (Pantene etc) so I did use a bit more than was recommended because of the thickness of my hair and left it in for 2 minutes more as well. The result was that my hair felt soft and was very easy to detangle after using.It does have a nice fragrance that is not overpowering and although I gave it 4 stars I don't think I'll be buying this. For 1/2 the price my Pantene does just about the same job.,4
"I purchased this in combo with the snail rollers for my 5 year old daughter.  This is a great product! Doesn't make my daughter's hair crunchy and lets her have a natural look.  Several people have thought my daughter's hair was naturally curly.  Go figure!  My daughter loves the smell, but what 5-year old wouldn't like it?",5
It came in three days. That was an amazing feat in itself. The gelish polish works very well and stays on for quite a while. I'm very pleased with it and I use it on my clients at my salon very often. I bought myself a set to use at home for convenience as well.,5
"This product really made my hair seem less frizzy, softer and more manageable. A little goes a very long way though, so be forewarned. Just the tiniest dab to start with and see how it works on your hair. On my hair, just the one little big worked wonders, but too much made it almost greasy.",5
"Well, these colors are just like using crayons (IMHO). Doesn't last, doesn't stick, does nothing for me whatsoever. Too bad...",2
"The Suave Cowabunga 2 in 1 is a very nice combination of shampoo and conditioner. It cleans well without leaving the hair dry. It also rinses out easily and does not leave hair feeling filmy or greasy. The scent is very nice (if you like coconut, which I do). The only problem with this is while there weren't any tears, my daughter got some in her eyes and she told me that it burned a little. So, when I showered I tried it, and yes, it does burn a little, but really not much. Not like regular shampoo. I like this, even for myself! It is also nicely concentrated. I can easily recommend Cowabunga Coconut.",5
"They stopped carrying this in the store near my house, but I love this lotion. Some other brands are watery and don't really last long, but Palmers is thick, rich, and smells like chocolate. Just like my men.",5
"Nope. don't bother. that big black beady eye is weird and it looks unpleasant. I wouldn't wear it anywhere, seriously.",1
"This is the best all natural deodorant I have ever tried. It smells great too. I love using it and recommend everyone to try it! If it works for you, you will be in luck because it is natural!!!",5
"The Nexcare Acne Covers seem to work SOME of the time, but not in every case.If you have a visibly mature pimple, applying one of these covers over it works perfectly fine. Within no time the cover absorbs it and the pimple is gone.On pimples that are just below the skin, not mature, or just barely poking through, they are pretty much useless (at least on myself and another person who I had try them).Two things that I liked about them are one, they stick and stick very well. I applied one before I went to bed, tossed and turned, and it never came off. They stick so well that you actually forget that it's on.The other thing is that they do a great job covering/hiding the pimple so no one really knows you're wearing one (or multiple).So at the end of the day if you have a visible pus filled pimple, these will work in a pinch. For those pimples below the skin or just coming through, you've got to wait for them to mature to apply one of these covers.",3
"I pair this along with the rapid clear Fade Gel and Cleanser, and my skin looks amazing. Blemishes are gone and my face is always clean. I love this. However, if you scrub your face raw, let your skin rest before you put this on, as it is high in salicylic acid, which really does burn.The smell isn't too strong but the aroma can burn your eyes once your first start using it.",5
"If you only want to prime your lids for shadow and are not concerned about any coverage, this is the primer for you. It dries matte quickly and it does a great job of keeping your shadows on for hours. I do notice some creasing after around 4-5 hours, BUT ...I do have oily lids and I'm sure that those who don't have this problem can get more hours of creaseless wear out of it. After using this up I'm afraid I won't repurchase, I will look for a primer that stands up better against my oily lids and also provides some coverage for discoloration.",4
This concealer is lightweight and easy to apply. finishes soft and keeps almost 6-8 hours. Hides dirk cycles very good!,5
I was skeptical at how this eyeshadow would look because of the price but was happy with the results!!! The sparkle is not enough to be very noticeable but is very subtle and I love it!,5
"I have purchased this hairspray before and loved it but this is the first time I bought it via amazon and something is off. It does not feel, act, or smell like the previous product (I bought at a local retailer). I am not sure if this product was not genuine or if it was old, but it is not the same. After four uses I threw it away, such a waste of money.",1
I bought these 10 Myo Brights Pigmented Eyeshadows first because of the reviews and second to fulfill my makeup kit and have pigment colors to experiment with I had never heard of this label until Amazon I was skeptical about them but LORD these eyeshadows are also underrated. First of all the packaging was Excellent and the shipping was sooooo fast. When I got them and seen them these colora look exactly the way they are displayed so bright. And lovely! And if you use contact solution they turn into eyeliners and are very very bright and intensed used with a lil water or fix plus. I absolutely love them so I ordered the other 3 color sets also. LUV LUV LUV This!,5
This product does not do at all what it is supposed to. It is basically a clear polish that does not make your nail color matte. It also messes up the color underneath. I immediately took it off after seeing what it looked like.,1
"This is my favorite most effective night cream. The first week I saw a major improvement in my skin. Far better then expensive retinea did. My skin was lighter more even and less wrinkled. This is by far the best ROC item. I feel that it should be noted that because this contains that bleaching agent that it shouldn't be used for more then a month or two. This was advice given to me by a dermatologist. Its a wonderful treatment but not to be used year round.If your looking for a drastic change, choose this. Its amazing!",5
"I have shoulder-length hair, and I find the barrel is difficult to wrap my hair around, since it's a bit too large, or my hair is a bit too short. However, it does heat up well, and I'm pleased that they include a heat resistant glove to help you keep from burning your hands and fingers. Overall, this is a very nice product.",5
"I normally don't like acne medications - they dry out your skin and then your face is a flaky mess.  With this stuff, you just apply a little dab to each pimple and it starts to work within 24 hrs - no flaking or irritation.  For a small pimple, applying it once a day is plenty; for something more severe, I usually apply 2-3 times per day.  Either way, the pimple completely clears up within a few days (hurray!).",5
"The Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Face Lotion works well and does exactly what it advertises. It is a perfect face lotion, my skin is dry and my face stayed hydrated all day at work. Using it out in the sun is another story, though it really kept my face from getting burned, I did have to apply it every 2-3 hours to make sure the SPF was doing its job. Even with reapplying, my face never felt greasy and I like how smoothly it applies. Its almost as if my skin just absorbs it as I put it on (in a good way!)The smell is great, it reminds me of the beach and summer. It is exactly what I expected it to smell like. This is a top notch product, but I can't justify spending $17.15 for the size.",4
"BEST BRONZER I HAVE EVER USED! I wish I could use it on my face!  IT HAS HAIR GROWTH INHIBITORS IN IT! :D:D:D:D  LOL, I work at a tanning salon, and I've gotten the packets of it at work, but we don't carry the bottles!  I am obsessed with this stuff, and I've been using it on my legs AND arms!  I'm incredibly  excited for this product to get here because the .57 oz packets are like 7 bucks!! I got the whole bottle on here for $11 plus shipping! :D  I've also seen them on here for 17-20 bucks too.. SUPRE MAKES WONDERFUL PRODUCTS... The snooki Black Hot Bronzer, and the 70x Bronzer are both amazing!SERIOUSLY, get it.  I am a certified tanning consultant, and I'm required to go to classes that train us on using all the newest lotions, and everything pertaining to tanning.",5
"This item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I find it difficult to get the bows to stay on. They have a dip in the back, point of contact is very small. I would prefer if the bows were bended to fit the natural curve of my nail. They are beautiful.",4
gets the color off immediately and no mess and scrubbing forever. will order again when im out. easy to use.,5
"I am all too familiar with the damage most flat irons cause to hair structure. In fact after cutting off most of the split ends and frazzled hair, I promised myself I'd cut the use of a flat iron down to a minimum. I always use protective products when I use a flat iron.This iron has a cloth covered plates where hair gets more surface coverage but doesn't rub hairs against each other, which is one of the major reasons hair gets so brIttle and damaged.I've been using this product for three weeks and so far I haven't seen or felt any damaging effects and my hair actually feels pretty good as far as texture, soft and managable.I have not encountered any problems when using this device and will continue to use it.",5
"Disclaimer: for twenty years now, I've watched the women in my life put on a daily moisturizer/sunscreen.  I've always believed that it would fight wrinkles and aging over time, but never thought about using one myself.  Even though adding one more grooming chore seems like at least one more too much (""You want me to floss AND moisturize?  Who am I, Brad Pitt?""), this is a solid product, and I'll try to stick with it.The can is sleek and very small, and after shaving and washing your face, you pump out a small amount and rub it in.  (Or else you get the hose).  The fragrance is pretty light, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling richer and smoother.  I've been using it half my face for a week, and I can definitely tell a difference - the moisturized side feels smoother and has less friction.As I said, the sunscreen is definitely a good idea - a lifetime of using an SPF 15 product on your face and neck should produce a prettier face at 50 than a lifetime of not.  This is a good product that feels pleasant and does what it says it will  Recommended.",5
"A favorite of mine since the early '80s, this is by far the best, most true-to-life rose fragrance out there at any price. It smells so much like fresh-cut roses, even down to the green stems and dewy moisture, that it manages to be elegant and earthy at the same time. It is not out of place on a hippie in a hemp maxidress, yet it can compliment a business suit and pearls. (A hippie trick is to layer it with musk, patchouli, or sandalwood oil. Tea Rose plays well with others.)  Where other single-note florals can be syrupy, cloying, and fetid, Tea Rose is a breath of fresh spring air and living, delicate flowers.Masterful in its simplicity, Tea Rose hasn't been appreciably reformulated over the years, for which I am very grateful. And don't let the EDT strength fool you-- this is analogous to most parfum or EDP concentrations in its strength and tenacity. One warning: Bees love this in the summer, so I avoid wearing it if I'm going to be outdoors in the heat. I don't mind my husband following me around for a sniff, but I draw the line at bugs!",5
Another high quality product that I bought to add to my homeade hair grease. My hair has been growing rapidly.,5
i  love it it is light want buy real perfume  it good for pricebuy and wear everyday cheap price for money clean,5
Okay brushes the bristles are soft and strong however this is a travel set and the bases are flimsy. One has already become un- glued!,3
"Non greasy, absorbs quickly, and doesn't have a strong smell... This lotion is just what I was looking for! My skin looks so much healthier that I bought a second bottle.",5
"What you see is basically what you get with the Precision QTip. This QTip is essentially the same as a regular QTip, but with pointed ends. Personally, I love having these around the house for special projects, or just getting into those harder to reach spot.Just be careful when using them, they can be a tad sharp.After going through a whole package, I do not think that I would switch from my usual QTips to these. But they do serve a decent purpose from time to time.",3
"I cannot believe how long and beautiful my eyelashes are. I got this product not expecting much out of it, but I was very dedicated to it and one day - within a week..I started seeing a little difference..then more and more..crazy. but it works. You must use it every night before bed. do not skip a day. Use it as if your life depends on it lol . every night. then...pay attention to your eyelashes ..you will see:)",5
What a great product! The crazy wand reaches places a traditional brush cannot. Great for lower and/or inner lashes. Thanks!,5
"This shampoo by Clear says it is a nourishing frizz control formula. My hair is long and tends toward being dry and frizzy, so I was excited to try this new shampoo. It's creamy and lightly scented with a delightful fragrance. It doesn't make a lot of lather (a good thing in my estimation). It comes in great bottle that sits neatly on the dispenser end and is easy to open with wet hands in the shower.I used the matching conditioner by Clear during the week I used this. The problem is that it just didn't work for my hair as well as other shampoos I've been using. My hair was still frizzy and dry after using this and it made my scalp feel a little greasy the next day after shampooing. I used it for a full week and the results were the same.One of the other people in my house, who has normal, non-frizzy hair, likes it a lot and is continuing to use it so it's not a bad shampoo. However, because it says it's for frizz control, I must give it 3 stars with regard to how it worked on my hair.",3
"This product is the bomb. I got a sample of this and couldn't believe the amount of suds for just a nickle size amount and how cleansing it is.  The scent is fabulous too.  For African American naturals, you can detangle your hair and it rinses out easily.  This is my HG shampoo now.",5
"First impression: This serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper for an applicator. When I first received the product I opened it to smell it, as usual. The smell is very bland and plain. It doesn&#8217;t smell citrusy like some Vitamin C Serums do. It isn&#8217;t a bad smell, but it is not amazing either.Before: I have a typically oily face, so I made sure to wash my face prior to using this serum. I used a quarter of a dropper full of serum for my face. This dropper has a flat tip so it releases more than pointed tip droppers. I rubbed it on my hands then applied it to my entire face and neck.After: I was a little disappointed in this Vitamin C serum because it leaves a thick and sticky feeling on my face. I feel like if this serum were thinner than it would not leave the thick feeling. As for the sticky feeling, there must be an ingredient that left this feeling. After a little while the feelings went away, which is strange. I can say that the serum left my face feeling very clean and soft once the sticky feeling disappeared.",2
"I gave this to my wife. For $200, she was quite excited to try this out, especially with the amount of time this could potentially save her in the morning when she applies her makeup for work. The prognosis is that it was ""okay"" and not as good as she had hoped. It did apply the makeup evenly, but it had her putting on a little too much makeup.This will probably be better for women who use a lot of makeup. My beautiful wife only needs a little bit to look her best, so this turned out to be not for her. But she felt that others could benefit from something like this. So, while my review is a little mixed, I would just say that this is not for everybody. Some people may love it, but my wife didn't.",3
"Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used! Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly! I have tried literally 100 mof lotions for dry skin this goes a long way not to much, if you have any rough areas buy it, you will never be sorry you bought 4.",5
"I purchased the Color science Sunforgettable SPF brush after having heard about it on a news program.  I love it!  It provides good coverage that matches my skin tone exactly.  The color of the product in the Amazon photos is true to life.  For those with dry skin, this powder might be drying if you do not wear moisturizer underneath.  However if you have oily skin this powder will provide a nice matte finish.  I chose to get Almost Clear without the sparkles and it looks very natural on me and as I mentioned it matches my skin tone perfectly.  (I am an Asian-American woman with olive skin). It dispensed readily' but the first time you use this, it will take a while for the powder to come down and fill the applicator brush.  It has a retractable sleeve to help protect the applicator brush and a cap that ""snaps"" on so you don't have t be too worried about it coming off in your purse.  It does seem to be sweat-proof with mild perspiration.  And while the powder does not come off of your clothes, if you ""rub"" your face on a tissue or blow your nose, the powder does come off...which is to be expected.  It is easy enough to reapply even without a mirror so it should not be a big deal.  I have yet to test this product while being out in the sun ALL day to determine the real SPF coverage......and whether or not it is comparable to a SPF 30 lotion....but when I do, I will report back.  But for now, I really love this product. I wear minimal makeup...just face powder, lipstick and mascara.... but this Colorscience Sunforgettable powder now replaces my regular face powder since it provides nice even matte color coverage with SPF.",5
"This product (the cream part at least) seems okay. It is quite thick, it did diminish the look of slight crows feet (I'm 33) after the first use. I have no clue what the point of the ""elixer"" is. This does not de-puff or really serve any purpose. I also had a very bad reaction to this product and I do not have sensitive skin nor have I ever had an allergic reaction to a moisturizing product. It burned the outer corners of my eyes so badly, I have red marks there now. I threw this out after one use. Would not purchase again. Will be sticking with my Clinique",2
"This facial brush is soft, but not too soft; your face will get cleaned without any harsh scrubbing.  You really wouldnt want anything too rough as it would tear your skin;  it is easy to clean and dry and I am pleased.",5
I like this product. It is easy to apply and has a nice smell. It seems to help control my hair. I have applied it both on wet and dry hair and recommend putting it on wet hair; it left my hair looking greasy when I applied it on my dry hair.,4
I recently bought this lamp at a beauty supply store for $99!!!! Had to get it! Now I get to do my nails on my own whenever I need to. I justified my purchase by the fact that every salon visit is $30 plus tip.  I will make my $ back in 2 months if I out the polish and other items I bought. I highly recommend this lamp.,5
So easy to use and transfers great!  Nice nail design size.  Great tool to have at your home nail salon.,5
I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have notice a little difference in my skin.  My skin is sensitive and I didn't have any issues. Im sure if I keep using it there will be more of a difference.,3
I don't know what I was expecting exactly but I guess it is true what they say you get what you pay for. you have to buy full press on like nails I guess  to put on them and the are very odd looking not like a real finger at all but I guess once I get nails to put on them they will still be good for practice,3
"I originally heard about this moisturizer through YouTube and decided to give it a try. I have a dry, itchy, scalp and it gets worse when I have a sew in and I've been trying different products to see which one would relieve the itch. I'm so happy I got this because my scalp barely itches anymore. I would recommend putting this in an applicator bottle or spray bottle if you use it on your scalp during a sew in/braids. I put this in a applicator bottle, filled it to about 2 oz and added like 5 or 6 drops of peppermint drops to it, shook it up and applied it to my scalp. The cooling sensation from the peppermint oil feels so good on my scalp! The product alone with no peppermint oil works, but after 4 hours or so, my scalp began to itch. I recommend adding a few drops of peppermint oil to this moisturizer. Your hair will not itch for days. Maybe a little scratch here or there, but it's worth it. I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again!",5
"My go-to sunscreen of choice wasAveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 oz..  This one gives that a run for its money though.  It moisturizes yet dried matte.  I was worried about the acne treatment in it being too harsh or too drying for my skin, but it wasn't.  I have dry pale skin.  The matte finish does make me want to buy a bottle once this is done because it dries super quick and easy so putting makeup over it isn't a problem.  As a sunscreen it works as well as the Aveeno I usually buy.  It's sweat proof, as scent free as you can possibly get and doesn't feel messy on, because of the matte parts of it.  I put it on my face and arms when going out in the sun.  I also have sensitive skin, but I didn't break out from this product at all.  A+.",5
"It's been really sweaty in california this summer.  Even though I don't usually break out at all, the weather has made my t-zone oily and gross, my skin is usually dry..  This face wash is GREAT and fixes the problem.  The formula is really creamy and thick.  Even a little pea sized amount washes my whole face, so I think this bottle will last me a long time.  It doesn't dry out my skin, which is also good because some face washes make my skin flaky.",5
"Had to use jewelry pliers to pinch all the links tighter. They pulled loose with the first wear. Otherwise, it's very pretty.",4
"If I use this straight up it's far too dark on my fair skin, so I cut it with Jergen's tinted moisturizer and I get the perfect color.",4
"I tried both the blonde and the light brown varieties of this Viviscal Hair Filler fibers, but unfortunately, neither is a good match for my hair color.  The product seems very similar to the Toppik Hair Building Fiber that I typically use, but the medium blonde color of Toppik is a better match for me.The fiber does stay in very well.  I cover it with a light coating of aerosol hair spray.  It washes out very easily, and doesn't leave a residue.  If you have a problem with thinning hair like I do, then I highly recommend trying this or a similar product.  It's just a matter of finding a brand/color that is a good match for you.",4
"Mistral's Almond Milk soap is positively divine.  As decadent as Dior.  As delicious as a dessert.  I am a big fan of L'Occitane's Almond line - I am completely addicted to their Almond Firming Lotion.  What I love about Mistral's Almond Milk soap though, is that the scent lingers throughout the day.  It is not strong or perfumy, but tender and natural smelling.The little bits of exfoliant added to the bar are great too.  They don't scratch the skin or feel too gritty, no nasty residue on the bottom of your tub.This soap does not leave a greasy feeling.  It lathers nicely and cleans very well.  It is so soft it can even be used on your face.If you like the scent of Almond, I highly recommend this.",5
"L'Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream - 1.7 oz.The first thing I noticed was the box was almost twice the size of the jar. I'm sure it's a marketing decision but when a product is being sold online as well as in a store, I don't know how effective the illusion is. It won't protect it in transit as the bottom of the jar is at the bottom of the box with no further protection. I got this product for my 95 year young mom to try on her skin. I am her caregiver and she likes these types of creams and this one passes muster.It has a nice smooth richness, without being overly greasy. It gets absorbed by her skin well and she likes way it makes her skin feel. She's very familiar with the L'Oreal name and has used their hair products throughout her earlier years.  I notice the fragrance more than she does and to me it's a bit strong. Overall she's happy with it and it's my joy to make mom happy in her later years.",4
"First buy the dark deep one.  its not extreme.  spray yourself 3 times taking breaks in between and drying off with a blow dryer med heat.  Because it goes on clear its hard to tell where you are putting it, that is why i spray 3 times, letting dry in between.shower first exfoliate with a sugar scrub make sure you are completely dry before applying.  make sure you also shake can continuously.  I even sprayed my face and it works great.never spray feet or hands, the excess will cover normally and naturally.  in fact i put lots of lotion on my toe nails and then wash my hands and apply lotion right after to  my hands.  Not your body.  good luck.  Best self tanner yet at a low cost.",5
"I picked up an Ecotools recycled plastic bath sponge in the personal care section of my nearby grocery store. When I first handled it, I was very skeptical. It felt like a finer-grained version of those plastic thingies that you scrub dirty pots and pans with. How could this possibly work on your body? Well, It works and works very well. I just get it wet in the shower, then pour a little thick body wash into it at a few spots, squish the ""sponge"" a few time to distribute the body wash throughout and, viola, give myself a good scrubbing. It feels remarkably soft and comfortable, but at the same time has good brisk scrubbing ability. Plus, it feels good. It's like being scratched all over, but it's a comfortable scratch. When I'm done, my body almost feels a glow from the scrubbing. Plus, of course, I end up with a nice clean feeling, much cleaner than with a wash cloth. Hey, this thing might be just recycled plastic, but it works real well.Gary Peterson",5
I love this perfume and I always get compliments when I wear it. To me it smells like blueberries with a faint low tone of musk. It is a very alluring sent that is great for evenign wear.,5
"Love this lotion! Smells good, lasts long, came double shrink-wrapped, and is very luxurious considering it is very affordable. Just ordered a 2nd bottle to have as back up. I am not going to run out of this stuff! Love it. Great company to order from as well. Their shipping and service is always fantastic. Will definitely order from them again.",5
I bought a few of these because it feels good on the skin.I would definitely recommend it.,4
"I adore Nexxus and normally stock up on it after Christmas when you can get Nexxus sets cheap. I generally useNexxus ProMend Shampoo, Split End Treatment, 13.5 Ounce. I wanted to try out this new version of Nexxus Shampoo to see if I liked it better. My hair is straight, soft, smooth and oily.I love the scent of this shampoo (although it may be too strong for some). It has a very sweet candy type smell. The Shampoo feels great when you initially put it on. Unfortunately, the shampoo made my hair feel dry after I washed it out. I usedNexxus ProMend Conditioner, Split end Binding, 13.5 Ouncewith this Shampoo (which normally leaves my hair feeling soft) and my hair still felt dry afterwards. It was also more tangled and difficult to brush. While my hair does feel dry with this shampoo, it also makes my hair feel clean, soft and smell good all day long.This shampoo may work better for someone with damaged hair, but it was not a favorite for me. I will continue to use it until it is gone, but I will be sticking with Nexxus Pro Mend when I purchase Nexxus.",4
"Ok, in truth, this stuff smells funny and somewhat unpleasant. It's not as bad as some have made it out to be, but it's not something you should use as a scented lotion when going out, that's for sure.That said, this stuff is AWESOME! Your skin, I kid you not!, will feel like silk after using this for a couple days. Like butter, you won't be able to stop touching it. And the effect stays even after you wash the lotion off (but not if you stop using the lotion completely, then you skin will probably return to how it was before, if it was dry, it will become dry again unless you eliminate what's actually making it dry). This is excellent to use after a nice exfoliating session.The bottle is comfortably big to allow for liberal application of this stuff. It's not too thick and you have to really work it in to the skin. It does feel a little sticky after it dries, so you may have to wash it off after you've allowed it to dry and soak into your skin long enough.",5
"I love this stuff!It's a very light floral fragrance that does go away quickly (so no smelling like a flower all day, which gets annoying.)I don't feel oily or greasy and it doesn't feel like makeup. No breakouts from it either.Love that it's inexpensive and has an SPF in it. I've found it hard to find something like that that I actually like.Try it!",5
"Following directions is key.  Great advice from poster who indicated that she applys alchol first to degrease as intructions state.  But the best advice was apply, rinse with water, then reapply.  THat made a tremendous difference for me.  I have applied peels before and I was wondering why it was not working as well as it did before.  Once I did the step of rinsing inbetween applications I saw a dramatic improvement.  I also have hyperpignmentation and I spot treat by applying peel via qtip to only the dark spot.  ANother step is I have my fan near by so if my face feels ""hot"" if you place your face near the fan it cools it down.  Of course this is not for long, I rinse the product off shortly after the ""heat"" begins.",5
Heard about this stuff by word of mouth - does the trick!  I'm always banging my nails around and messing up my home-manicure.  This stuff helps me keep my hard work intact.  Great for speeding up the process when you are doing nail art too,5
"This makeup brush is soft and lovely. I use it for my covering powder and so far it has been great. I've only had it shed once and it was because my cat was playing with it - he likes it, too.",4
"I have never used a polish remover that compares anywhere close to this!  I had 5 coats of polish on my nails and all 10 nails were completely clean in less than one minute, with no residue or stains. No mess, either.  It just gets rid of all traces of polish in seconds flat.  Definitely buying more of this!!",5
"I have olive skin and dark brown hair that I color blue black and without a bright lip color I do not look my best (unless I go heavy on eye makeup). And WITH this color, I barely need any other makeup aside from BB cream & mascara. I LOVE a nude lip, believe me, and use a gold to create that occasionally but for everyday wear I need brightness. This CoverGirl Outlast candy apple 270 is perfect for me to create the bright warm red-coral-pink I need to brighten up my face and if I have this on, I look &#34;done&#34; even without eye makeup. Technically this is a red, but I never normally wear anything that would be called red. I need a bright color but often colors that are bright on people with pink-toned school don't show up on me.  A color like cool hot pink looks terrible on me even though I like it on others, because it just sits there and doesn't enhance my skin or eyes.  This candy apple color is perfect on me (and I imagine it would be great on anyone with olive skin and women of color.) I use at least two coats.  Instead of using the clear gloss over it I use L'Oreal Colour Riche LeGloss in Raspberry.  By doing this I tone down the color just a bit and add a little more of the pink I want. I also line this in a bronze.  This combo of colors somehow works perfectly to make my skin look a little less yellow.  The CoverGirl stain lasts FOREVER.  (It is all over my drinking glasses...)  But even if I eat or drink, the outlast is still there. I do reapply and add more lip gloss (the L'Oreal Colour Riche LeGloss is PERFECT over this if you have olive skin) but it really still is there after I eat.  Because I reapply it, and use two or more coats, I buy at least two if not four or six tubes at a time. In stores it costs more than it does here.  Buying two at a time is perfect!",5
"Best and most gentle yet effective make up remover I've ever tried.  Where has this been all my life!???!!!  I will never go back to anything else.  Effective, gentle, works fabulously, cheap.  You won't regret this.  I only wish I could get it where I live!!!",5
I have to say it is a bit too light for me.  I have to apply several times in a day.  It is still a very good product to carry in my purse.,4
"Love this  little dish! It's small, portable, and practical for what I use it for. Great price and great usage I get out of it.",5
this palette is perfect!I use to be scared of bright colors and getting this palette made me want more neon palettes like this.so many colors for a great prize.they are all good sizes to. no dime sizes its more a nickel size its bank for your buck!,5
"I have bought volumizing shampoos and they have left my hair feeling dull and heavy. This one didn't do that. My hair felt clean and refreshed after shampooing with this. I really like the scent, it does not have too strong a perfume smell, but a clean and fresh smell. I didn't notice any extra ""volumizing"" than normal, however.",4
"I have used these for years to easily remove the mascara.  I have tried other brands, but I always come back to these.  They are moist enough that you don't pull on the skin around your eyes, but not greasy.  I think you'll like them. They do a good job.  They are also good for removing the rest of your make up.",5
"About a year ago, I developed horrible eczema on both of my calves, spreading from the ankle up to the knees. It is scaly, dry, unsightly, and most of all ITCHY. Despite using topical steroids, I haven't found very much relief, and would sometimes wake up in the morning to find that I had been scratching all night, leaving my legs covered in scratches and sometimes bloody streaks. Gross.Then I started using Eucerin, and what a difference! My legs are hydrated, and aren't as itchy anymore thanks to the colloidal oatmeal in the creme. Because I'm not scratching as much, my scaly patches aren't inflamed all the time, reducing the redness. I'm a much happier person since I started using this. Of course, using this OTC creme isn't by any means a solution for eczema, but Eucerin is very soothing and really does help relieve a lot of symptoms.Four stars because I don't think it's as good as controlling the itchiness as well asAveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 7.3 Ounce, though both contain the same active ingredient (colloidal oatmeal 1%). Don't get me wrong, Eucerin is good, and very hydrating - but I find just a tiny bit more itch relief using Aveeno (though it is less moisturizing).",4
great to keep in a makeup bag to reapply if you like during the day. Egyptian musk is one of my favorites. this one smells very nice.,5
"This is a pretty slightly shimmery fairly light pink. It is much lighter than it looks in photos. If you want rose...this is not it. That being said, this will be a nice summer color, but application is more difficult as brush strokes are more visible than in many other Gelish colors.",4
These arrived quite fast and they actually look much better than the circular -typical ones-. Can also be used for other hairstyles like a bun in a half pony tail..,5
"I bought this before and the product had leaked, probably from being so hot here in vegas. They did replace the bottle after I had to take a picture of the oopsi and prove I wasn't lying. So they sent me another one. Well since then I have used it up because I love the effect it does to my polish colors and so I also bought the white one also. Since ordering this I found a product I like better and is much cheaper but live and learn. This product is good, sometimes the black dots are hard to get distributed, sometimes you get no dots. The brush wears out before product is gone but overall it was worth the look it gives and the price compares with OPI",4
"i hadn't tried other oils before and wanted to know if it could help with my uber dry ends. i get all the shine with without weighing it down or grease. smells delicious! and after just 2 uses, noticing much much better end throughout, even with drying and ironing as usual.I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review but I was not compensated for the review in any way.",5
"I really care about paraben, sulfate, phthalates and some, and I thought this body oil is only natural and ordered it, but I searched online and found a webpage saying it has paraben. But when I received this, the label said it's free from paraben, and sulfate and mineral oil. I don't know which is correct. Anyway, it still has some artificial colors.",4
"I have very fine hair and have always had a problem with split ends, so I hoped this product would help. Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner combo left my hair feeling weighed down and almost greasy. I think that if I had very thick, dry hair, that the effect of this shampoo would be welcome. However, it has the opposite effect on my fine hair. I also noticed that the claim of 70% split end reduction with the shampoo and conditioner was in comparison with a plain shampoo and no conditioner. So it's almost saying it's better than nothing. The results require 3 uses to reduce the split ends. After 3 uses, I had a buildup that was not desirable. I really wanted to love this product, but I didn't have that experience.",3
Reviews must be at least 20 words longTThis order came in very fast.... I have ordered close to 20 wigs from here and they always make me happy with there products and prices..... The curls on this wig was lovely along with the color..... & the thickness was good to for the price...,5
Love the product but havnt use it yet Because I will be going to school this fall to learn how to use this product,5
"I use hyaluronic/vit C serum daily. The long terms results are remarkable. I get compliments regularly on not looking my age.  I like this product, feels like the real deal, not diluted. Use it morning and night, moisturizer and makeup apply nicely over.  It has a nice dispenser, spill proof. Made in the U.S.A. following strict GMP manufacturing standards to ensure purity and potency. 60 Day - No Questions Asked Money Back Guarantee. good customer service.",5
I have dry curl hair( type 2b-2c) and thirsts for moisture. I love this. I purchased at Walgreens it was on sale for 6.49  for the 32 oz and the ingredients caught my attention. For those that are complaining that it leaves their greasy it has argan **oil** in it. If your hair is fine or have an oily scap I wouldn't recommend this. My dry hair absorbed this and it felt silky smooth. I also love the smell. I find that my deep conditioner works even better after washing with this.,5
Dove has stepped up their presence in Men's personal hygiene products.  The product is very good as far as fragrance and if you are seeking a traditional antiperspirant.  It is not a gel but composed of white substance.  Dove does a good job in offering a nice design which is very functional in dispersing the product.,4
I would have given 5 stars however the lock on the barrel became jammed with the first use and I had to break it in order to use it. Other than that this product is amazing. I can completely style my entire head of long hair in ten minutes. The waves will last the entire day. This was worth the money even though I can no longer lock the barrel.,4
"Does the job needed, I use it on my maltese and it keeps his coat dander free and bright white",4
Love the look of these when all is done. They are a little tricky to get the hang of but the result is pretty cool.,5
"I've always used It's A 10 Miracle Moisture Shampoo and along with their Miracle Leave-In Product and they have worked just fine for my color treated hair.  Now, I also use Kenra and Fekkai hair products for color-treated shampoo/conditioners (on alternate days), but use the Leave-In Product on a daily basis (it's a must). :)When I heard that It's A 10 was coming out with this new Volumizing Sulfate Free line I was really excited to get ahold of the shampoo to try it out.  With their product line I have found that I don't need to use a conditioner on a daily basis I can use their shampoo, and the Leave-In Product and I'm ""good to go"".I also like the fact that I was able to order the Volumizing shampoo from Amazon for several $$ cheaper than through the Salon/store pricing. : )(thanks Amazon)!So, my hair is fine, and I color treat it on my own at home ~ I like Sulfate-Free shampoo's/conditioners because they keep your hair healthier, and hold on to a ""hair color"" longer, and maintain that ""color vibrancy"" and make it look so much nicer!Using the Volumizing Shampoo I have really noticed a difference out of the other Sulfate Free shampoo's I've used.  This shampoo does give the ""volume"" it is intended to do.  It also makes makes my hair feel, nice and clean and light and bouncy.  Oh, and on the ""off days"" that you don't shampoo your hair, your hair will still feel nice and clean!  When styling after shampooing I use just a few products and I like the ""light"" feeling I had, yet knowing I was getting the volume I wanted and needed.You don't need to use more than even ""one pump"" of the shampoo from the bottle.  It lathers up really well and rinses out great.  The smell is really nice.  I have heard some people say that they don't think they get a good lather out of their shampoos so they end up using too much shampoo when all they have to do is just rinse in a little water to lather up the shampoo to make it more sudsy for them.  This is definitely not a need with this shampoo!  I also noticed that with some shampoo's my hair tends to feel ""brittle"" or ""snappy"" after shampooing, with this one, it didn't.With the Volumizing Line they sell the Miracle Leave-In Lite Product to be used in conjunction.  I want to purchase and try that out, but I have a fairly new bottle of the Miracle Leave-In Product to finish.  I have been using it with the Volumizing shampoo and it's works out just great.  So, if anyone is questioning if you can use them both together, yes you can! :)When searching for a new shampoo or conditioner it can be overwhelming as there are so many products out there.  I would definitely recommend this one for anyone that wants a shampoo to use for volumizing, sulfate-free, a color-protectant, and shampoo that won't make your hair feel limp or weighted down after shampooing (or that snappy/brittle feeling I described above).*****Stars for a great hair product! :)",5
For the past 2 weeks I have been experiencing super puffy eyes on my lids and great big bags under my eyes. I tried burts bees radiance eye cream and a clinique eye cream also. Both creams failed to produce results so I decided to give this a shot. I put it in the fridge ad put a nice thick layer on my lids and bags before I went to bed and withhin 5 minutes all the puffiness and bags were completely gone! Wow! I even woke up with no puffiness and bags. i don't know what they put in this gel but it works wonders for me.Ok I had to go back in and take off 2 stars because after using this for about 5 days my lids became super dry and started to burn. I stopped using it and applied some vaseline on my lids until the dryness and burning went away. I think I will use it just to get instant results but it's not good for long term use.,3
My uncle has developed eczema in his mid-60s and has been self-conscious about his newly imperfect skin. Vanicream has helped both in soothing his itching and helping to [slightly] fade the marks on his skin.,5
"I bought this cleanser to replace my old one - which was the original Neutrogena wave.  I thought that it would be an upgrade, but it is a disappointment.Swirling action - My old one vibrated - so I swirled and it would go back and forth.  Although I thought that it was too mild to be doing anything, it worked well.  This new version swirls.  So, I have to stop swirling.  Ok.  Fine.Wet and soft pads - So, I reach into the pack and find that the pads are wet and soft.  I apply it and so now there is a wet and soft pad that is lathering up my skin.  No exfoliating action at all.  And, yes, the cleanser is drying.  This might be good for acne, but overall, my thoughts are - why buy a power scrubber if not for better/faster exfoliation?Battle of the sonic scrubbers - My other takeaway is that Neutrogena must have made its sonic version to compete with Olay's popular sonic scrubber (Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, $30).  Olay (gentle scrubber with gritty cleaner) is competing with Clarisonic ($118 and up; interchangeable brushes with your own cleanser).My next move will be to try the Neutrogena sonic wave with different cleaner pads.  If it exfoliates will, then it's a keeper.  Otherwise, I think I'll spring for the Clarisonic... there is something to be said about not having to buy pads all of the time.------------  Update - I tried other exfoliating pads.  No luck.  They are all ""too gentle"" for my taste.  The search begins...  Update - I am now happily using Nutra Sonic ($100 or less; bought mine refurb for $55).  No more single use pad; it uses brushes.  Now I can use my own cleanser - which changes by seaon.  Yes, the sonic brush  costs more upfront, but I'd rather invest than to keep paying out the nose for something that I'm not sure is working.  No questioning whether my skin is exfoliated with the sonic brush - it can feel it and, most importantly, I can see it.  My skin looks great!  After the first time, my skin looked much better.  No scrathes.  The brush is soft but it does the job.  After the third day, my skin looks beautiful again.  Sorry Neutrogena. I'm waving goodbye to the wave!",1

During the winter, the Eczema seems to be worse.  Luckily, my dermatologist recommended Eucerin and I've used this product (along with a prescription drug if necessary) for the past 20 years.

"I have hair that is fairly typical of an older woman and I need a conditioner that helps keeps the frizz that comes with hair coloring and loss of moisture under control. I have tried many conditioners looking for ones that keep the frizz to a minimum but does not come off too greasy and 'Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner' really seems to be doing a great job. There is not intense scent to it so for people who don't do well with scented hair products this would work nicely. I usually condition my hair twice, once with a regular hair condtioner and then again with a more intense conditioning product. I have noticed with using this Pantene product I have been able to drop the second conditioning treatment because this product leaves my hair nicely condtioned, without over doing it, on its own. Certainly it is a good thing to be able to have one step conditioning at a price that is mid-range, so not all that expensive. The conditioner is nice and thick so the amount you put into your hands all makes it up to your hair and there is no waste from the conditioner dripping, or running, between your fingers. Not a lot needs to be used, about a fifty cent sized amount and you are good to go. I recommend this product for hair that has problems with dryness and frizziness. I think you will find it does a pretty good job for the price without an over powering scent.",5
"I recomend this item, when i get it and try it i love it so much, you should get one.",5
I actually like this foundation a lot. It is medium coverage and looks flawless. It doesn't ever look cakey and the colors match my skin nicely. I have 842 medium beige. I love that this has a pump too!!! The only thing that I don't think it has is lasting power I have dry skin but this did not stay on my skin which was weird.,4

Overall my skin felt soft all over and I didn't notice the oily spots I had before application. The rough patches on my skin were also gone and my skin had a more even look to it.  I also like how it left a fresh natural look on my skin afterwards, so many other facials masks leave a shiny look after removal.  I can't wait to see how it works over the coming weeks.  I plan to use this once a week.The packaging was great and the jar was a good size. I will be able to get so many treatments from one jar.

"This brush set isn't really good at all for applying eyeshadow.  The brushes aren't sized correctly and don't pick up shadow well.  The set is missing a firm, flat brush for packing shadow onto the lid.  It is also missing an angled eyeliner brush.  The blending brush is big and has an odd shape.  The crease brush is huge and not good for creases.  It just makes a mess.  Also, the envelope to hold the brush is a rough texture and gets dirty easily.  The ONLY brush I use is the highlight brush to apply my highlight shade and blend out the edges of my eyeshadow.  I occasionally use the smudge brush to smudge out eyeliner in a pinch, but it's scratchy and not quite the right shape.  Personally, I am happier investing in good quality brushes that are perfect for the job and not buying cheap brushes that don't cut it.  Yeah, good makeup brushes are expensive but they make a HUGE difference in how your eyeshadow comes out.I use:  Mac 239 or Urban Decay Good Karma brush (the one that comes with the Naked Palette) to pack on eyeshadow, the Mac 219 to smudge or define my crease, the mac 217 to blend.  Then I use the highlight brush from this set.",1

Good quality designs on the stamp plates.  No duplicate plates and a few duplicate designs.,5
the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle. I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine. I think it was just random defect. I like the one I have now just fine.,4
"I know this is a facial moisturizer, and it seems a bit heavy and oily for my face - doesn't make much of a difference. It is very moisturizing for the back of my hands.But I give it a 5 star review for the area around my eyes. I accidentally discovered that it works wonders for my eyes. I'm in my 30s and if I put this around my eyes (but don't let it get in your eyes, because it's not intended for this purpose) within minutes, I seem to look younger. I get mistaken for someone 5-8 years younger if I use this around my eyes at night. I use this at night before bed and I also apply some Perricone MD Firming Facial Toner (also, not intended for use around eyes). And I look a lot brighter, younger and healthier when I look in the mirror.I've tried other more expensive eye creams with collagen and elastin and they didn't seem to make a difference. Something in this makes a huge difference for me.",5
"I didn't pay much attention to moisturizing my face when I was younger. Now that I've reached the age when a morning check in the mirror includes dry skin and tufts of ear hair that serve as daily reminders that I'm on the downhill side of life, I'm keenly aware of the need to apply some lotion to soothe the rough edges.I was skeptical of Dove's claim that its face lotion could be applied without a greasy feeling. I was wrong. I apply the lotion after shaving and it absorbs quickly without a cloying smell or oily residue.My wife complimented me on my skin (that was a first!) and reminded me to trim my ears.She's a romantic.Rating: Four starsBTW: My only complaint about this product is the unnecessary amount of packaging. I'd rather buy this in a collapsible tube instead of the short can.DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback.

"I've been using this product twice a day for 7 days and was really hoping for something better than Department Store products, but this wasn't much different; just more expensive.The AINHOA Caviar Gold Facial Serum with caviar extract promises to diminish fine lines on the face, on aged skin, but I can't see any difference, and I use a magnifying glass to inspect my skin. My pores are the same size, and unfortunately, so are the wrinkles on my forehead, around my eyes, and mouth.My daily routine includes exfoliating my skin and applying a moisturizer twice a day.  I am 49 years old and have  good skin for a person of my age, thanks to a non-smoking and non-tanning or sunbathing lifestyle.  Still, I am bothered by wrinkles, especially the ones on my forehead that have recently become more pronounced.I like Department Store products, like Elizabeth Arden, and Kiels, but was hoping the AINHOA products might be more cost effective and have better results.  While this product does help keep my skin soft, so do Department Store products.  My wrinkles are exactly the same after 7 days of using this product 14 times.  This serum comes in a nice bottle that holds just one ounce of product, and for the price, it's just prohibitive.  Department Store moisturizers & serums offer larger quantities for comparable performance.So, unfortunately, this product does not impress me.  I see no real difference in my skin.",3
"The colors in this palette are absolutely gorgeous and vibrant!  The wide selection of colors in every single shade look wonderful when combined or by themselves on your eyes.  The brush that came with the set is also so adorable; all my friends were so jealous when they saw it.  For the price I paid for these colors and the brush, I feel like I got a really great bargain and definitely my money's worth and more.  Fabulous shades and easy application due to the colors each being separated into individual containers.  Came well within the estimated arrival time and great products overall.  NYX is a great brand to buy from, and good products overall.  Thank you so much!",5
"I don't recommend this makeup. I am a very youthful looking 32 (no ""fine lines"" yet) and this makeup made my skin look terrible. It's too thick, to start with. I tried applying it with a brush and with a powder puff and neither worked well. It highlighted every small flaw and looked too thick and ""makeup-like"". If you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation, I guess this product would be good. It created an extra layer which creased as the day wore on, making it look like I had wrinkles where I normally don't. Also, this makeup has a shiny look to it.As an alternative, I recommend one of the ""tinted moisturizer"" type products, which are just a light touch. If you have nice looking skin, but just want an added touch of radiance, this product won't be right for you. It's better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup.",1
"I like the Wen products. This one does smell like it is described. I would say more spice smell then pumpkin. It was sealed and came with the pump. Overall, good purchase. However, I prefer the sweet almond fragrance of Wen.",4
"I like the bright gold color this displays off my eyes once it's dry. I have to say, it does burn for a couple seconds once applied and then it's fine when dry.",4
I love this comb. Its huge. Doesn't pull my hair. Great for people with curly hair. I am glad I purchased it.,5
"I have my hair highlighted at a salon about once every 8-9weeks. My stylist uses a purple peroxide and golden highlight combination and leaves some of my underside the darker brown of my natural hair. I did this rinse after 5 weeks of my coloring, when the roots are beginning to get darkish and the color is fading. I used gloves to apply to wet hair--and noticed it didn't foam up, but was rather a gel. I left it on 4 minutes and rinsed. VERY heavy smell to this. Not unpleasant, but very perfumed so if you are sensitive to smell, this is not for you.  As for the color. I did notice a small change in my mid highlights (I used cool blonde). My lighter color remained the same and it did nothing for my roots (which it wouldn't because of no lightener in the rinse). My hair felt nice, but as for a real color &#34;boost&#34; it wasn't enough for me to want to buy another bottle.",3
"This hair dryer is pretty good for the price.  It has alot of options as far as speed and heat, plus has the turbo option and a cool shot.  It doesn't dry my hair faster unless I use the turbo option, even then it's not a big difference.  I still like the hair dryer though, it's easy to handle and does it's job.",4
"I have to admit that I've only used this product once...last night after getting out of the shower. I sprayed it on and immediately got nervous because it seemed a little slimy in my hair (I have thin, brittle hair that gets oily after 12 hours, unless I put dry shampoo in it) so I was thinking that I had been dooped and I'd have to wash my hair again....to my surprise I blow dried my hair (in 5 minutes-it usually takes 10) and there were no tangles. The true test was here...I usually have to run a straightener over the lumps in my hair before bedtime or it takes me forever to straighten in the morning to get all of the creases and lumps out of it, I didn't last night. This morning I got up and it was a mess, like I'd anticipated! I ran the straightening iron over it and it straightened right out! This cut down my prep time by at least 50%...which is much welcomed early in the morning! Smells pleasant too! Try it!",5
"I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.I really like this serum. It's not a heavy serum but really gives you that moisture that is needed to keep your skin looking fresh and aid in ridding redness, dullness and scaring. I used this product for a couple weeks and saw great improvements in the look and feel of my skin. Will surely continue using it.",4
"This is a kind of multitasking product, but something in it irritated my skin, and after using it just a few days, I had to stop.",3
I am so happy with the matte colors.  This is just what I wanted.  They go on smoothly and evenly.  I love the combinations that are possible.,5
"This scrub smells really good.  I've only used it once, but I am convinced that it will be a staple in my beauty products.  It left my skin so smooth and moisturized without being greasy.  It didn't make my bathtub a slippery slope either from the moisture, so far so good...",5
"This lotion stings my face a little, so I personally prefer the oil-free kind that is less expensive, but my husband will ONLY use this lotion.  I thought I would pick some up at the drug store for him while I was out, but one bottle was almost $16!  That's almost double the Amazon price.  So, I took the drug store lotion back and will be sure to only buy it on Amazon from now on.",5
These pearls are beautiful and and a touch of elegance when you want something more classy. They are great! They arrived early. i really love them Thanks,5
The color is so pretty! I really love gold and earth tones and this is my new favorite. I was scared it would be  hard to take off. Not at all came off like any other shadow. It stayed on all day with the same intense color.,5
"***Not your average serum*** This one is much more silky than the others I've tried, It smells wonderful (most others don't) and the company added a lot of extras to this product so it isn't just plain vitamin C serum.With that being said, as much as I loved the ingredients and the smell and the texture... It didn't work for me. I had extremely oily skin and started breaking out within a few days of using it. I do have pretty sensitive skin and rosacea so it's pretty common for me to have some type of reaction to new products which led me to message the company about it. They were extremely nice and suggested a few things to try and we talked about what could be the cause of it.I ended up giving it to a friend to try and he LOVES IT!!! His face is brighter, the little acne he had has cleared up since he's been using this, the puffiness under his eyes is almost completely gone, and (his favorite part) you can hardly see the wrinkles around his eyes any more. He's already a little over half way through the bottle and he's already asking me how to get more because he doesn't want to live without it ever again.Moral of the story: Valentia Vitamin C Serum works, but not for everyone. I unfortunately had a reaction but I had my mom try it before I passed it on to my friend and both of them loved it and had no problems with it.I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I'm rating this as four stars because I can literally see that it works, it just didn't work for me so to keep it completely fair I took off one star. It's given my friend some amazing results though. I'm so tempted to steal the bottle back and try again but... He knows where I live.",4
My Natural hair has always been very dry and brittle no matter what shampoo I used. I decided to try co washing and have not been disappointed. This is the best product for my hair as a replacement for shampoo. Sometimes natural hair just needs different types of treatment and I'm so happy I tried this as an option.,4
"Well, should I go to the cosmetics department, test them to see if I'm allergic and pay $60 for 2 oz of sunscreen?Or should I just randomly purchase sunscreens with as many different ingredients as possible to find one I can use?I could just consult an allergist for several hundred dollars (alas my HMO has a waiting list for allergists several years long, I'm out of network) and just find out.What about the user experience?The cream is thick and heavy. very very. You will have to really work it into your skin. If you worry about too much drag on your skin creating wrinkles and stretch, you won't like this.  You'll know when to stop when the whitish color fades out. Try warming it up in a cup of hot water if you need speed application. It feels more waxy than oily.The top note of the scent is lavender followed by a distinct but not overwhelming blend of cocoa butter and beeswax, followed by a confusing mish-mash of everything else in the ingredients list. I am sure there is something on that list that you won't like and something that you will.But unlike so many other sunscreens I can use this one. And it doesn't cost $60 per tube.",5
"I bought the sample kit and I'm glad I did.The products all smelled really good in the bottle but after using each: the nopoo, conditioner, styling gel, and moisture lock, my hair smelled like an old man's aftershave and it made my hair VERY dry and flyaway.  I don't know if the sample I purchased had gone bad or something but my experience with Deva Curl was awful.  I'll stick with the macadamia nut oil products.  They smell and work wonderful on my frizzy white girl curls.",1
I love this! Hot Tools has the best curling irons! I only need 2 more to have the complete collection :),5
This helps to keep my &#34;face&#34; in place all day long. Could apply the foundation and the mineral veil and it stays for hours!,5
"Great quality, color variety, wonderful finish, and an affordable price. Quality: Put one coat and your done. Colors: Picture says it all. Finish: Not gloopy and fine smooth finish. Price: One bottle = $1.25 can't beat that.",5
"I am giving the product 5 stars because it seems to deserve it from the other reviews.  However I can only write this review as a warning to anyone considering purchasing it from the seller XPRESSURSELFI ordered this about a week ago, and while the polish showed up on time and intact, I received &#34;Fairy Dust&#34; instead.  I have left a review in the appropriate seller feedback location as well.  I noticed from some of their other reviews that substitutions without notification is a regular occurrence for them so I'm going to go out on a limb and state it was likely not an honest mistake.Regardless, I tried Fairy Dust and it is a lovely glitter top coat as well, it just isn't the Stainless steel color I wanted.  I will try to order it again from someone else and cross my fingers they get it right.",5
"This top coat has some big pros, and some big cons for me. The pros: it is pretty glossy (although not really any glossier than any other top coat I have used). The biggest pro is that it dries SOOOOOO fast! This has literally cut the time it takes to do my nails at least in half, because almost as soon as you put it on it is completely dry! That would make it my favorite top coat if not for one thing: it chips my nails super fast! I'm lucky if my nail polish lasts 24 hours without chipping to be completely honest. I will then fix the chip, add a second top coat of it, and by 48 hours, the majority of my nails have chipped pretty bad, and I have to completely redo them. So I would recommend this if you need to make your nails dry very quickly, AND you like re-polishing your nails quite frequently.",3
"I bought it from Goods-cool for about $3 with free shipping.  Shipping is as expected (30ish days) from China.  It is heavy because it is made out of metal.  If you don't have a lot of hair, don't expect this clip to hold.  It is very pretty in person.  I will be returning to buy more hair clips from Goods-cool.",5
The spray comes out very harshly even at a distance and i don't feel it really did it's job. I will not be repurchasing this product again.,1
"I love organic beauty products so much. VoilaVe's Argan Oil is a new love of mine and a happy addition to my natural beauty arsenal! It is a sizeable bottle and you only need a small bit of the oil to apply all over, so it will definitely last and provide a good value. I use it on my hair, skin, and nails. Everything feels very smooth and soft after use.The cap sprays nicely and I spray a bit into my hand before running it through the bottom of my hair and across any skin that needs an extra glow. I also noticed my cuticles felt much healthier after applying to my nails. I love a multi-use product like this. It saves so much time and looks so nice when used lightly!",5
"I knew better than to try something other than my Covergirl. I hate this stuff starting mainly with the cheap, flexible, trash they call a brush. I actually saved an old CG brush to use when I use it. I accidently bought two. I'm almost done with the first one but I don't care, I went ahead and bought some more CG anyway. I will say that it doesn't seem to chip off which is great. Other than that I am all around disappointed.",1
"I was really hoping I'd like this polish as I've liked Loreal products in the past. They've redone the line though and supposedly this is a ""pro manicure"" formula. I've tried it twice and have bad results; fading and peeling on day two of using it. Not recommended.",2
"I purchased this item to help with my dry and brittle hair, for me it works best after I wash my hair I use it as a leave in conditioner. Helps with tangled hair, helps dry brittle hair.",5
"I can't give a fair review on this, because I haven't used it yet.  Will revise this review when I finally do use it",2
I love the way this smells and its not that expensive. This tames my curls without weighing it down at all. Very happy with it. would recommend and buy again.,5
"I love this perfume.  It last and depending on your body chemistry it will not smell the same on everybody.  I would recommend this product to all the ladies that like to get the question asked, ""What are you wearing?""",5
This product is mostly marketed toward young males. However I'm an older female that has longer length curly hair. Sometimes I enjoy styling my hair with gel to get a wet shiny look. I was attracted to this product because it's description states that's it's a wet look gel.The product has a gender neutral scent.The scent fades away almost completely as the gel dries. So no worries for ladies not wanting to smell like a teen aged male. At first I was slightly disappointed with the small tube of product. However with use I find that a little goes a long way.Performance wise this is a very good product. It's not sticky or overly stiff. It produces a true wet look with some hold. I noticed no flakes after the gel dried.Overall good product for as anyone looking to have wet looking hair.,4
I would like this straightener better if it had a regular plug-in.  The straightener continuously shuts off and I have to restart the adapter on the plug.  Don't recommend this straightener because of it.,3
"Ok so my nails aren't long and they are constantly breaking.  I thought MAYBE buying these would keep them from chipping so badly and they did!  I put them on and then trimmed off the extra parts and then with the extra parts of the stickers I was actually able to apply them to a different nail and got a lot of compliments!  they really do stay through water and work and seemed to prevent A LOT of chipping and tearing, even the cuticles ripping stopped (maybe that was just timing but I wore these twice; each time lasted over a week) and both times the tearing, chipping and breaking stopped... if you use trim the extra and put it on another nail it really does look pretty cool and you don't waste anything... just a suggestion...",5
"Bought this as a gift for my father who had recently bought another scent that seemed to be a good deal, but when it came it was just a sample size tube. This bottle contains 3.4oz, a generous volume that will last for a couple of months.Please take note that this is an eau de toilette, not a cologne, so the scent will not last as long as a cologne.  This is not to say that this Nautica E.de T. doesn't last, just adjust your expectation to that fact.Secondly, this is a perfect daytime spray, also good for summer evenings - clean, crisp smell, not musky at all.Overall, very pleased with purchase.",4
"I was looking for an orange concealer a little darker than my normal skintone to conceal my under eye circles, and unfortunately, this still appears lighter than my skintone when applied.  I like the texture, however, because it is very creamy and easy to apply.  A little goes a long way, so this jar will last me for months.  I will continue to use this as an eye brightener, because I do love the texture of it on my skin, and the fact that it doesn't get caky throughout the day is a plus!",4
"Haven't seen a motionless difference in my pores appearance. I got this stuff hoping it would aid in cleaning them out. It hasn't but it does smell nice and wipe off any remaining residue in my face, a good prep before my facial cream.",4
"Oh wow.  This is the first mask I've bought that I actually feel like DOES SOMETHING, besides just feeling good.  Truth be told, this one is a little uncomfortable, especially if you leave it on longer.Me: dry, hormonally-acne-prone skin.The mask: ruthless.Are people really mixing this with water?  Really?  I use it as directed, with ACV (Bragg's), and whip it.  I do NOT understand why the directions indicate applying it 1/4""-1/2"" thick.  I tried that the first time and it fell off in pieces.  I recommend applying after a good 10 minute facial steam.  Open up those pores and make the clay WORK.So, you may or may not feel the pulsating, but hopefully you will feel the tightening.  Woo.  Sucks your face right in.  The ""black-hole"" comments crack me up.This stuff is messy though!  Boo!  I am afraid of it clogging the drain!  I just don't tell my roommates, and try to get as much of it off before hitting the shower.  I dab my face with a warm washcloth, filling a basin with water, and try to get the majority of it off there so I can dump it outside and not deal with the possible clogged drain.Inexpensive, and natural.  Bentonite is really great.If you're looking for another mask containing bentonite, try Concha Nacar's Bleaching Cream #3.  It's not a bleach and it's not a cream; lost in translation, it's a refining mask.  Gentle, but does contain bentonite as well.Enjoy!",5
"I love this product! My natural hair is Wavy and frizzy hair so i use this product when my hair is wet and then blow dry my hair. It makes my hair very soft and sleek. Sometimes after I curl my hair and put hair spray on it i also use this product to soften it. This product smells so good too, it smells refreshing and clean. It also protects your hair against getting ruined by humidity. I totally recommend that you try this product.",5
I work in a factory and I routinely shower directly after coming home from work. Still I experience blemishes. I started using Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub and watched the blemishes reduce to really nothing. How could you go wrong with Biore?,5
"I am not happy with these products. The steamer doesn't create enough steam for a facial, even with holding a towel over my head. I can hear & see the water bubbling and can't help but wonder if it's going to bubble boiling water onto my face. The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well. Looks like it was made in the 1980's, and made cheaply as well. Very disappointed. Will return.",2
"Friend recommended this.  Tried it, does a great job.  Makeup artist for a wedding I was in was also impressed with this, especially since it's a drug store item.  You can &#34;build it&#34; and layer to get more effect.",5
beautiful neon baby pink. perfect for those who want something bright but don't want any loud colors. Essie never disappoints.,5
This product is amazing. It gives you a glow all the day. I used two times since i got it and i love it.,5
"I love this iron! Firstly, it is extremely light weight. I love the fact that you can lock the temp set temp so there are no accidents while using no more accidently turning it off or even worse burning you hair. If it is your first wand take your time but once you get the hang of I dont think you will want a traditional iron again.",5
Only who's they came with glue but at this price who cares.. they work great kinda hard to put on but the fabulous when u do get them on natural beauty,5
I have dry combo skin. I like this mask it helps calm breakouts. Does not dry skin out. Leaves it hydrated and feels tingly.,5
"I've seen a lot of recommendations about this lipstick, and thought I would get the Hippie Chic for its nudy, slightly pink color. Well, as can be expected of buying makeup online, the color doesn't match what's on the screen (it's less nude, more pink, and brighter/color stands out).HOWEVER, when I applied it, it did make my lips look nuder, and with a bit of lip gloss I can get it to look like what I wanted it to.BUT, there is another down side to it: when applied, the lipstick gets a bit flaky at certain deeper creases of your lips. It's fine if someone's looking from afar or on a camera/in photo, but if someone gets close enough in real life they'd be able to see these conspicuous spiderwebs on your lips. Putting on lip gloss doesn't help either. None of my other lipsticks/lip gloss does this.",3
"THIS BRUSH IS PERFECT, IT DOES NOT SNAG OR TEAR YOUR HAIR. IT MASSAGES THE SCALP AS YOU SHAMPOO. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO WASH YOUR HAIR AGAIN WITHOUT IT.",5
"A few drops are enough to cover your whole face.  Spreads very well and the skin absorbs it quickly.  You can feel it working after a couple of days and I even saw a mild peeling, nothing noticeable after applying moisturizer.",5
"The Elixir, is an amazing product.  I just take a a large drop on my hands and rub it all over my hair.  Instantly, my hair feels better, not greasy or heavy, just silky.  My curly hair even curls up prettier.  I'd have to say, that my 60ish dry hair could pass for much younger hair in looks and feel.  I can use it on my hair dry, or when it's freshly shampooed.  It doesn't seem to matter much on how well the product works out.  Either way, my hair feels and looks great.",5
"No flakes, no clumps (when applied correctly) and super long, thick lashes. I get so many compliments on my lashes. This product is amazing. Use it and love it.",5
"It didn't do a thing for my relaxed hair. I deep condition with it under my hooded dryer, and it felt like I didn't use anything. My hair was tangled and hard",1
"I bought mine at a small specialized fragrance boutique shop. As an admitted soap addict, I wanted to try it out since it's packaging was attractive and it was a HUGE bar and i love berry fragrances and it was a very large soapbar and it's triple milled made in france made with organic African shea butter & olive oil, but i didn't think I'd really like it because it smells kind of musky and masculine smelling before you even take a bath.  Well, while bathing, it had a highly aromatic fragrance, it lathered well, it did NOT smell at all masculine, it got softer while bathing, and the fragrance stayed well with me after bathing.  It definitely looks like it could last for a long time for many bathings.  The back says it's ""100% pure vegetable soap"" and ""not tested on animals.""  It's definitely worth it as a gift, aromatherapy, or an everyday soapbar.As with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn't stay to liquefy the soap.",5
I got this lotion thinking it's gonna be great.  Well come to find out the person I bought it from sent me a old one.  The shelf life of lotions is about a year or so.  It has a weird smell and turned me some-what orange within the first use.  I Garantee they sent a really old bottle.  It had scotch tape on the top of the lid to hold it on.  I will not be buying from this seller again.  What a rip off!  I don't think the lotion would be bad if it was a recent bottle.,2
"The Simple Oil Balancing Wipes are the perfect addition to my morning and evening routines.  The wipes are generously sized, easy to use, and definitely seem to make my skin smoother and more even toned.  The scent is mild and I've experienced no allergic reactions as I do with some products.Although I keep trying their various kinds of wipes, the Simple brand is becoming my go to for face wipes.  They are a fantastic value and a very good product.",5
"UPDATE: Had to stop use of this product as my acne was out of control after a few months of using this product. I switched to Proactive since my acne has gotten so severe while using the Yes to Carrots. I wish this product had of worked, but it wasnt strong enough or maybe was causing more break outs on my face! Ugh...A small jar, filled with a lot of power! This is a great product! I use it a few times a week and I really like it. The container is small, but the mask inside it awesome. You dont need much, and it applies easily. After you apply, I waited about 5 minutes and allowed it to dry. It came off nicely with a wet towel and then I just splashed water on my face to remove any left over mask. My face felt so clean and fresh after I used this too. I also noticed that my acne began to clear up after I used it once. Highly reccomend!",3
"This polish is perfect to make a jelly sandwich with any glitter. I got it after seeing PackaPunchPolish's youtube video of her sandwiching this and Pirouette My Whistle (which I also got). If you don't like the annoyance of taking glitter off, this is great to wear for a soft look. My nails are stained so I like to wear a couple of coats of this. It's like a concealer for your nails.",5
"I've been searching for a vintage red type lipstick but everything seems so bright that it almost starts bordering on orange. This is gorgeous! The matte look is fantastic! And if you don't like the matte you can always add a nice chapstick or gloss to it. It stays on FOREVER which is fantastic!! Even after I took a shower I had a tint to my lips, I really like this lipstick.",5
"I know nobody likes to buy makeup on line when you can't test it, so I wanted to help people out. First, this particular color IS vegan (I don't know about any of the pink or red Ecco Bella lipsticks). Second, it doesn't dry your lips out or get cakey. Third, it works really nice as a wear-to-work lipstick because it is neutral and natural but has color. My coloring is fair skin, green eyes, and either deep red or dark reddish brown hair (I've worn it with both hair colors and it looks good with both). I can pretty much wear this with any clothing that I wear except maybe black and it looks good. Also, it is not deep brown--it is a nice light, but not frosty, brown.",5
I use Revlon Colorsilk all the time. I wish I could have more of the conditioner because that conditioner is a life saver to my hair. That goes for all types of hair dyes though. Came out almost black but as i washed a few times it is at a perfect deep dark brown.,5
This is the cutest idea.  The graphics are very detailed and vibrant.  It's very nice to have them in the roll so that you don't lose a bunch of little pieces.  Graphics are cute.,5
"This is my daughter's assessment. She finds the iron good on all the details of design, style, operation (especially the fast warm up) and quality. What makes it stand out is that it leaves her hair feeling and looking better than the other aids she was used. Her comment is that she can't see anything providing a better result.",5
"This product has a repulsive and nauseating odor.  I followed the directions on the label and the end result was that my fine, color-treated hair was so greasy.  Totally unacceptable. I used the rest of it to shave my legs. L'Oreal, please go back to the drawing board.  Both your formulation and your fragrance are unacceptable.Later, after using this cleanser, I had the chance to try Wen and loved everything about it but the price.  Now I see that Clairol Herbal Essence has a cleansing conditioner, which I'm sure will smell far better, and there's a Pantene formulation as well.  I'm going to give those a try and will see how they work.",1
Have been using for several years and love it.  I get a lot of complements on my skin and I attribute to this product.,5
"I love face masks and have tried a bunch of different kinds. However, I've always been on the lookout for the 'perfect' clay and mud masks. I believe I've finally found it. For such a pricey item, I only use this on my t-zone and around my cheeks where my pores are larger. If any of you are fascinated by things like pore strips (because of all the icky stuff you can see), then this mask is right up your alley.My skin type is oily, and all you oily people out there know how hard it can be to maintain it. After the first time I used it, i could see how much clearer my skin was. That amazed me. Masks often take a few times to really start showing results. Not this one!To see how well this mask drew impurities to the surface, I used a pore strip right after. Typically when I use pore strips, I always feel like they could have done more. Since all the gunk in my pores were pulled to the surface by this mask, that little pore strip removed it all, and yeah, it's kinda gross but hey! Just saying how it is! I'm sure that with a few more uses, this mask would've removed what my pore strips did but why waste the product?I highly recommend this to anyone with oily to oily-combination skin.",5
"It smells like Happy By Clinque but with a more earthy smell to it.  This is not for me and I would not ever buy another bottle.  But on a good note, I love 360 Pink, IT IS MY FAVORITE.  So not all the Perry Ellis's are on my Hit List.",2
"I am a mature female who has developed areas of itchy skin, also itchy scalp, that have been very disturbing to my daily living activities .  I find this product to be very helpful with my symptoms & have also ordered the 100% neem oil from Amazon to add to shower gel,etc.  I plan to keep using this product.",5
"A little goes a long way. Make sure u use a moisterizer after applying serum. But serms to work well only been using for a few weeks. Like i said use little bits at a time, it goes a long way. My skin feels softer  an wrinkles slowly fading n have to use everday.",4
"Well, to start with I'm over 50. My skin is fairly good for my age, but I am very fair and without makeup I look blotchy, so I wear foundation every day. I always think I look nice, but this is the first time in ages that anyone has commented on my skin. Since using visible lift, I've had lots of comments, curiosity (i.e. ""what have you done, your skin looks so flawless - where did you get it? How much does it cost? Exactly what shade are you using, etc."")The improvement is so dramatic that it's almost embarrassing. Want to be suddenly beautiful? Then this might be for you.",5
"I love this lotion! It has a great smell, and doesn't leave that greasy feeling that some lotions do, but not watery like some other lotions can be, but I guess that depends on your skin and complexion. But it works great on me, and my daughter, mom, and sister.  And it does have a glowing soft shimmer (as advertised lol), not so much of a &#34;sparkly&#34; or &#34;glittery&#34; look, looks great in the sun. It has a gold-like hue, but not like a self-tanner. I'd recommend this product to anyone! It's hard to find, not sure if it's discontinued? Anyway- 5 stars!",5
"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.I should have known when I opened the jar that it wouldn't turn out well. The creme has a slightly oily texture that didn't feel moisturizing, just wet. When I applied it, it didn't penetrate very well for awhile, it just sat on my skin, even though I used a very tiny amount and only on the outer third of my undereye area.In the morning, my eyes were irritated, watering, puffy and I had a rash on my upper cheeks that I can only guess was there from the product sliding down my face as I slept. TWO days later, I finally stopped feeling like I needed to rub something out of my eyes and the redness faded from the inside lower rims.I may have fairly sensitive skin but I have never, ever had a reaction like this to a product.",1
"I didnt like this free pick comb, It was just okay, I like the old fashioned steel pick combs and thought Ill try a plastic one, but this one didnt do the trick!",2
"This beauty blender is ok. My favorite sponge was by MAX factor but it has been discontinued for a while now and I've been on the search for a good sponge ever since. This isn't my favorite product, but it'll have to do. i do like the shape though. It makes it easy to handle and get into tight spots like around your eyes and nose. It's ok, try it.",3
"I really liked this product, I have sensitive skin, hormonal acne is one of my problems and I get 2 to 3 zits-like from time to time which leave my skin red and I was looking for a product that would help on my worst days.  These concealers have helped a lot.  They are light weight, and if you learn how to use them they work like magic.  I usually apply a tiny green dot on the area I need to cover the red, then I blend it and if the &aacute;rea is too big I use the beige concealer on top, if not I apply the Almay Smart Shade Smart Balance foundation and looks really good and natural, it deffinitely helps me feel better and confident.  It has worked great for me.  In case you were wondering I am latin with an almond tone and light to medium skin tone.",5
Lemon freshness I used this in oil burners and in my homemade soy candles and this worked very well smells real lemons,5
"Cream-like conditioner in a good sized bottle. Pleasant scent. After leaving in place for 1-2 minutes, rinses out easily and leaves hair feeling soft and easily manageable. Works well whether used with matching shampoo or not.",5
I did not have any yellow nail colors so I bought this one. It is a very light yellow color and looks pretty good on nails. I do not use very often but is good for when I do want yellow. Formula was good- not too streaky or too thick.,4
"This is one of the best colognes out. Though it has been around for a while it is timeless. This is the cologne you will be with for life. It is masculine, yet sexy the ladies love it. I personally wear this one when there is a lady whose eye I want to catch. The key to this one is it can be worn by anyone. No style refused on this one old or young this will bring the ladies oh yeah giggity giggity. Step your game up without breaking the bank. best worn in the evening; dress wear or casual wear",5
My pre-teen daughters both use this shampoo. One has very fine shoulder length hair and the other has hair almost down to her butt which is very thick and she likes it too. It smells great. Amazon had a great price on their subscribe and save so I definitely added it to my monthly list for savings. The pump feature is the best! So they don't use too much at once.,5
I really like the color of this blush and it goes on nicely. I would definately buy again. I'm a fair skin blonde so the shade works great for me.,5
"I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.",5
"My hair is curly but fine, and flat on top so it literally sticks to my scalp. My hair dresser used this on me last week and I LOVE it. Just dust a little underneath your top layer and rub your fingers on your scalp and you will have a good amount of lift and volume, without it looking hard or being sticky.I've used the sprays, gels, mousse that you have to blow dry to get a good texture and also tried back combing (it looks ratted on thin hair!) and this powder is the best. I gave it all the stars because it totally beat every other product or trick I have ever used!*Also, it never made my hair tangled or stiff... you can not use a lot on your roots, a little goes a long way! It's a small bottle for that reason, you do not need much. Just like every product, you have to apply a little at a time until you get the effect you want. I only put it on my back roots and rubbed towards the front and it worked great. I do not put it on the rest of my hair.",5
"I've been using this product as directed for a few. Weeks now, & although it doesn't seem to darken the lashes, I've noticed longer light lashes.  I also haven noticed them thickening..,.at least. Not yet!",4
"Just received this product a few days ago and it is already a part of my daily routine.  I had read about the many benefits of rosehip oil and I am very impressed with this 100% organic and GMO free formula.  I have been using coconut oil as my main daily moisturizer for quite some time now, so I added a few drops of the rosehip oil into that and blended it well - just that one small change has already made my face much softer and lessened the redness that I have been experiencing for the last couple of years.  I am looking forward to using it on some scars that I have on my arms too after reading several other review about that.  I love this stuff and I am hooked!",5
"I'm a huge fan of moisturizers, especially body butters, and this is one of the very best. Despite not being ultra thick like most butters, it certainly moisturizes like them! It has a pleasant smell, yet is subtle, unlike many of the butters I've used; they're usually a bit overwhelming when it comes to scent.This is also one of the very few moisturizers I can use when my skin isn't still damp from the shower. Maybe I'm alone in this, but I usually can't apply a moisturizer to skin that isn't freshly washed without being very conscious of it being there, and feeling like it hasn't absorbed. That feeling drives me crazy, so I usually only apply moisturizer directly after showering. I can use this butter anytime, and it never gives me that feeling that it's just sitting on my skin. It also leaves a pretty, healthy looking sheen on my skin without making it look oily.",5
"This product is by far the best one ever and Ive used many ,many expensive hair sprays. This stuff brushes out and keeps your style for days. I dont use anything else after trying all the expensive stuff. This is very expensive too, but on this site it is the least expensive Ive found. It keeps my hair for many days and I dont have to wash it like with other cheaper and even more expensive products. This Amazon site is ausome and I love it for shopping online.",5
"I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin.",5
I LOVE IT it is wounderful productsit is BEAUTYBLENDER no one can deny itthank u . .love it,5
"I'm a thirty-something professional woman who occasionally (maybe once or twice a month) must contend with a blemish. So, take this demographic into account while reading.Though the price-tag on the Zeno seems daunting, rest-assured, the product works!! In our instant-gratification society, this little wonder fits-in nicely. Blemishes subside rapidly and with no discomfort. (The tip of the Zeno becomes very warm but the sensation, for me, was not unpleasant). After two treatments (several hours apart), my blemish was virtually unnoticeable with the help of my mineral-foundation.Now, it may interest you to know that I've used Renova for over six-years, so I was a little hesitant to use the Zeno (though I saw no contraindications in the booklet). (For those who are unacquainted with the product, it is a Vitamin-A derivative which must be prescribed by a physician or dermatologist ... while it encourages collagen growth, reduces fine-lines, and exfoliates, it also leaves your skin vulnerable to sunlight and various other elements.) I have used this product on two different occasions with no side-effects. (I am only speaking for myself, of course. So, be sure to take care if you are in a similar situation ... and if you have an adverse reaction, feel free to comment on this post so others can read it).The Zeno is now a permanent part of my beauty ""arsenal."" Between the Renova, Bare Escentuals (as recommended by my dermatologist), and the Zeno, my skin is absolutely pristine and glowing. A minor miracle ... and, as one reviewer stated and I firmly agree, I wish this was available when I was a teenager!Bottom-line: the Zeno is quick (two and half minutes per treatment), painless (for me), concentrated (it addresses just the area that requires healing), and really cute!! (Aesthetically speaking, it is super slick!!) In my opinion (and I am a tough critic!) the Zeno is entirely worth the investment!",5
"I saw reviews saying this was a wonderful product and reviews saying it was a rip off. I am in the wonderful category. Day 4 and my nails still look like I did them 5 minutes ago, and I am very hard on my nails and not careful about protecting them. Not so much as a teensy lift on any of them. I agree that you want the strip slightly thinner than the nails as it becomes apparent that you want the gel on a bit of bare nail on each side. I think that is the key. Also, keep the gel top coat thin!  I love ""Wine Not"" color and usually I don't wear bright or dark colors because they look so bad by day 2 or 3.  I will update as the days go on, but right now I am totally sold on this!UPDATE: Day 5 and after cleaning all cupboards and moving boxes and extensive cleaning. Almost imperceptible wear on the tips but other than that, it is still literally perfect. Not one chip, no lifting anywhere.Day 8: Slight, very slight wear on the tips of 4 nails, other than that no chips and as glossy as when I first put it on. Beyond impressed and I have done all sorts of things that would have previously totally trashed red nails.Day 11: One teensy chip on side of one index finger. One teensy chip near cuticle of pinky. Filed off minimal tip wear. Still as glossy as day one. I expect to make the 2 full weeks or longer before there is any need to even begin to consider a new manicure. I am 100% pleased with this and won't ever go back to the old method. My nails also feel thicker and stronger than ever. Good protection from breaking! These are my natural nails.",5
"Does what it says, all day hold for my curls (which would always fall flat the second I left the house) Awesome!",5
The first day that I used these sponges I started getting pimples. I will definitely not used them anymore that's for sure.,1
Application is easy and the results are long lasting.Very easy for DIY at home soak off gel nail polish usersas it self levels so it never comes out with polish lines.I would describe this color as deep plum - its very flatteringto most skin tones.Do be aware that the colors are hard to anticipatebecause our computer monitors vary so much in theirability to properly show true colors.Best to do some google searches and find one of the manyimages posted to see it applied on others to help decidewhich color you want.,5
"Unfortunately this was way too harsh for my face and caused a slight rash. (It should be noted that I have sensitive skin.) I ended up using it instead for exfoliating my hands, arms, and back. A word of caution if you're the sensitive skin type like me.",3
"Arnica is well known as a homeopathic remedy for muscle aches, spasms, overexertion, bruising, etc.  It comes in many forms, sublingual tabs (melt under the tongue), liquid, ointments, creams and sprays.  While the tinctures and liquids often taste awful, this spray is thankfully tasteless, a real plus for me.  Not to mention the fact that it works, and works great!  I have some muscle and arthritis problems, and this helps quite a bit.  Also helps hubby with night time leg spasms (along with potassium supplements).  We keep several versions on hand all the time.  Dr King also has an ointment of arnica, works great too!",5
Great product!  Very easy to sharpen.  Have used them for few months and this thing still sharp my pencils like brand new.,5
"As soon as I took this item out of the packaging, it did shed some. But I used it and it was fine. I LOVE this brush. Blends perfectly, I recommend to any brush starters!",4
this is a wonderful product. It coved the grey in my eyebrows. I highly recommend this product.  The product is easy to apply and remove,4
"The new Axe Detailer is just what is says it is...a ""shower tool.""It is a functional bathing tool, but one that the guys won't be embarrassed to put in their shopping cart, even if it is a virtual one.It maybe for that reason that the packaging on the product looks so...well phallic. But, that is niether here-nor-there, the Detailer is an effective bathing tool, it doesn't miss a thing, a soft mesh side for your general washing and a coarser side for the ""dirtier spots"" feet and hands and such.  When used with the AXE shower gel (or your choice really) the mesh side works up a good lather and the red scrub side is a nice finishing tool. The ""handest"" bit about the Detailer is the hard rubber that separates the hard and soft sides of the tool, this serves as and effective grip for washing, one you can't get with a simple mesh thingy from a ""bath"" store. Points radiate out to comfortably hold in the hand, along with a standard loop for post-wash hang-up to dry.I am unsure of the pricing concerning this product, as it is usually part of a promotional pack, allowing you to get AXE shower gel along with the Detailer, but I would certainly recommend the tool. But, it is hard to shake the strange (possibly less-erotic-than-intended)imagery of the AXE commercial connected with this tool, the one with the woman-driven-man-washer...",5
I really like this product.  I have very curly hair and this time of the year it gets really frizzy.  This product really smoothed my curls and left my hair feeling soft.  It is easy to apply and it smells nice.  You can really see the difference when I use this product.,5
"I don't know if anybody else has discovered this, but I find that the UV light helps ""cure"" regular nail polish into a much stronger, more durable prodouct.  I was getting gels at the salon but, after repeated applications and removal, my nails were getting destroyed. I decided to take a break from the gels and noticed that my regular salon manicures were lasting way longer than my home manicures, even though I was using all the same products.  The only difference:  I dried my nails under a UV light with a fan at the salon.  So, I bought this light for home use and -- Ureka -- my polished nails are lasting days longer, even when doing laundry and housework.  I'm using the light (along with a small fan) to cure each step of the application:  I put on two coats of base coat (OPI Nail Envy)and use the light/fan combo for a couple minutes, two coats of color (OPI)and use the light/fan for a couple minutes, finish with top coat(Seche)and use the light/fan again. The polish was totally dry and I immediately used my hands without fear of messing up the polish.  The manicure is lasting a whole lot longer than it used to.  I'm on day #5 without a chip, having done 8 loads of laundry and ironing.  And believe me, my natural nails are tissue paper-thin.I gave 4 out of 5 stars only because the bulb connections are pretty flimsy.  I hope the light lasts.  It's the same unit they use in the salon I go to, so I'm cautiously optimistic.",4
"The world of airbrushed makeup is totally new to me, but I can't think of a better system to start with if this describes you also. The system could not be easier to set up and use. The learning curve is a little steep but not quite as steep as I expected. Right now I find that it works best in a pinch but going forward I can see that there are many more possibilities than just saving time. I am going to need more practice but this seems like a great little system so far.",5
So far I really like this product.  I've been interested in learning more about how to strengthen/lengthen my hair and nails and Biotin seems to do just that.  It's been gentle on my stomach so far and I haven't noticed any side effects other than harder nails & healthier hail.  I'm also glad that this supplement contains natural ingredients that I can feel confident ingesting. Thanks for the great product.,5
"Shower gels aren't something I use very often. In fact, it's only when I'm offered a sample that I try one out. It always seems like more work than simply using a bar of soap, as lazy as that may sound. But after being satisfied with the Anarchy deodorant, I thought I'd give Axe's shower gel a shot too. Get in the shower, lather up and rinse it off and you're good to go. I used about a half dollar sized drop of gel the first time, covering my body and arms, and then went with one more dab to take care of my legs and feet. It felt fine and didn't irritate my skin anywhere.The smell is nice and not overpowering. You can definitely tell it's there on you while showering, but as soon as it's rinsed off and you get dressed, you hardly notice anything. It's just a pleasant smell that lasts through the day. What it smells like exactly, I can't say. If you've been around people that use Axe products before, it blends in with the rest of them.At this price, it's not a bad deal. I'll probably stick to bars of soap though.",4
"I am African American w/very oily skin and after my 3rd pregnancy I began to have very bad acne. This product has worked wonders with removing the extra oil on my face. Typically my face is shinning like the sun by 11:30 am. I am now going the entire day with my skin looking normal. No more going to the bathroom to try & soak the oil up with a paper towel. EXTRA NOTE RE: ACNE IF INTERESTED I tried Mary Kay Classic - no results positive or negative. I tried Proactive - negative results leaving me with a ton of scars & hyperpigmented skin. I made changes to a more natural routine, African Black Soap as a cleanser, unrefined coconut oil as a night moisturizer, only when needed.  No more MAC make up, changed to mineral foundation. These changes have produced great results as it relates to Acne. I'm not saying Mary Kay, Proactive, & MAC are bad products, they just didn't work for my skin. My skin is very sensitive. The Kiss my Face Pore Shrink along w/the Glycolic 35% peel, should remove the hyperpigmentation - I am seeing positive results from this peel as well, I've used it twice. Hope this info helps someone.",5
"This lash style was just OK for me. My eyes are rather on the small side, so these were a but overpowering.",3
"Packaging: It is sturdy with a twist on lid. Personallyl, i dont like the peachy-orange packaging because it looks cheap to me, but that  has nothing to do with the quality of this product.Smell: To me it smells a bit like baby powder and eucalyptus. My family has said it smells pretty good and not anything like baby powder.Feel: This is a very light oil that smooths on the face nicely. Doesnt feel so much greasy as it does creamy. Hydrated soft skin.My Experience: When I first  used this I put it on half of my face I noticed that it imidiatly made my skin start peeling (I had been in the sun the past few days) so I washed my face again and reapplied to the same area. After the 2nd application I could feel my skin drinking it in. My face did turn red (as it does with ANY oil product). Redness goes away in about 45 mins. My skin felt softer. Looked flawless and dewey.My pores are smaller. This product basically helps push all the impurities out of my skin and replaces it with the lovely bio oil for healthy radient skin. LOVE THIS!",5
"First of all I love that the glove that comes with this is like soft jersey material. I have purchased hair tools in the past that come with rough gloves that feel like a Brillo pad, not only do they make it difficult to feel what you're doing but they also give me endless static in my hair! So the fact that this glove is nothing like that is awesome.I have fine hair just past my shoulders and it only took 30 minutes to get through all of my hair and the best part is that it lasted hours (with no hairspray!).The only downside is the power button. The position of the power button is so inconvenient and as you are doing your hair it is so easy to turn it off. I must have shut it off 5 times by mistake. I love that you can change the temperature as well. My hair was silky, wavy and shiny! Love this wave wand!",4
"This conditioner is perfect if you have dry, coarse, frizzy hair - I do and it makes my hair soft and smooth.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and my hair just keeps getting softer and shinier.  It is also non-irritating (I have extremely sensitive skin) and protein-free (protein tends to make my hair feel crunchy).Just be warned that it is extremely rich and doesn't fully rinse out.  Some people can use it ""as is"" but I get the best results when I mix 2/3 White Camellia conditioner with 1/3 California Baby shampoo and use a small amount of that mixture as if it's a rinse-out conditioner.  That way it still leaves a tiny bit of oil in my hair but not too much.Edit May 2011: After some diet changes my hair became fine instead of coarse (same amount of hair, different texture).  I still like this conditioner with fine hair ... but only in very small amounts.  I use a pea-sized amount of it as a leave-in if my hair is looking too big and fluffy.  Mixing it with a different conditioner helps it to rinse out if you want to use it as a rinse-out conditioner.",5
"This and take the stage, were my first nail polishes I got. I wanted nail polishes but every time I got them they all chipped. I gave up for a long time, and gave all my old nail polishes away. I got almost all from the supermarket. I have only been to the salon once to get my nails done and this was a long long time ago and I got the french tip style nail paint and I don't remember how long that lasted but I think it lasted quite a long time. I didn't remember the brand either. But I was looking through all my magazines and this one had these sticker nail art stuff and I remember hearing about them but I never got them because of $15.00 cost. Then I got 4 stickers from a magazine, well I was curious and I always look at reviews. Well they seemed to be great, but they last 2 to maybe 3 weeks and others lasted not as long, seemed like the ones with the stones lasted longer for some reason and when using a top coat sometimes it would help and sometimes not. Well I then remembered hearing about gel nail polish, well they are great but require a uv light from what I was reading to set them solid. They are like fake finger nails after they are hardened if I read that right. Well I don't have a uv light thing and I don't want one because that's just to much work and I was thinking about cancer even though you can get the glove, but still your sides are exposed, no thanks. Then I was thinking there has got to be something else. So I looked up chip free nail polish and up came Opi, I really don't know how long they have been out, I guess a long time. But like I said I got my nails done a long long long time ago, I'm just not that girly. When I had nail polish I felt girly, but since I gave all mine away because I would chip them off, I didn't feel girly anymore. Now I do! These last a long time and no chipping!!! Very happy!! I'm waiting until my nails are longer to use the stick on freebies I got in my magazine to see if I like them or not, to get them on a special occasion because they are very pretty and you have a variety and I'm not a artist so I wont be able to do any special designs on my nails, if I did try it would probably not look good or take a million years just to make maybe one look good-very doubtful. So I would just get those sticky nails and call it good :)",5
"I purchased the BareMinerals Foundation in Medium Beige from an Ulta Store some time ago and have been wearing it daily. It covers nicely, minimizes pores and does not break my face out. At age 48, I still have oily skin and can have enlarged pores if I am not really careful with the makeup I wear or the skin care products I use (on the plus side, I don't have any wrinkles!). This product gives you a nice incandescent glow that looks fairly natural BUT you have to be really careful not to use too much.  I would advise investing in a really good makeup brush--or set of brushes--and keep them clean, because when they get too much powder on them it is hard to reapply.  Other than those recommendations, this is a great product.",4
I own over 25 Sigma brushes and this is one of my daily favorites! I use this brush daily to sweep away concealing setting powder. This brush is huge!! It's very SOFT and very well constructed!!! I have not had any problems with shedding or issues with bristles falling out. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! I would recommend this brush to anyone and would buy it again if needed!!!,5
The bristles are soft but very sturdy.  Great quality and coverage for face.  Having fun playing around with the different angles on brushes.  Very much worth their price.,5
This came quickly and is in an elegant silver and gray bottle.  This goes on before your makeup to remove those wretched dark circles under our eyes that make us look old and tired.  Thank goodness!,5
"So I was tired of buying those cheap, plastic ball tipped brushes over & over again. I wanted a brush that was good quality & would really last! I did some research, and this brush looked like exactly what I wanted.. well, I was wrong, very wrong.This brush rips out hair like nobodies business. If you expect to remove any tangles with this brush the only way you'll accomplish that is by literally ripping the hair out. I have straight hair, and that's the result I got with this brush, I can't imagine if someone with curly or wavy hair tried to use it.In short, if you don't want to rip out your hair, don't buy this brush.",1
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my opinions, and I'm entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize... HOWEVER - this review is 100% truthful.Okay, so this is Vaseline lotion, and it is everything you know and like from this dependable brand. Hubby, however, says he doesn't get the &#34;hype&#34; over the Spray and Go part. You still have to rub it in and get your hands dirty, so why not just use regular lotion?I can't say I blame him... I mean... It's true. The lotion has a nice, light smell (and I'm really picky about men's products), and absorbs quickly.",4
Did an excellent job of protecting my skin while I was vacation last month.  We took a five day cruise and spent quite a bit of time outdoors and had no problems with sunburn. It rubbed on easily and was quickly absorbed by my skin without leaving a heavy white residue. I also loved the fragrance which to me smelled a lot like a fruity tropical drink.,5
"I have tried to be very patient when using these and in the end, they met their maker, the trash bin. The sticking power sucks. The colored lines are so flimsy when trying to peel them off of the plastic wheel that the wheel just comes right off. If you want line decorations on your finger, just use made for design polishes with the thin lined brush. This only got an extra star because of the assortment of pretty colors. Other then that, just don't waste your money, no matter how cheap they are selling it for.",2
"This brush is similar to the Goody brand you see locally. In a way this is better than a Goody, because I can't pull the tiny plastic tips off the end of the bristles, like I can on my fairly-new Goody brush. Works well with my fine but thick hair and doesn't irritate my scalp. Also, no static electricity! However, I'm sensitive to odors and this has the ""from overseas"" plastic scent and it hasn't gone away yet. ~~~~I received a sample for review~~~~",4
I tried putting this on my hair straight out of the tube at night before going to bed. It's not greasy so  I haven't had any problem with it staining my pillow cover. I apply it generously then rinse my hair in the shower the next morning. I then wash my hair as usual and use the conditioner I use daily. It really helped when I was recently hospitalized with a DVT in the lower leg. The huge doses of blood thinners given causes hair to dry and fall out. By the time I came home I could see what the drugs were doing to my hair. I began applying this product at night and after 2 nights my hair began to recover. I still need to apply it about every 3 nights but this product saved my hair.,5
"These are nice designs.  When they arrived they were kind of over the place because they are so thin and they slide out of their compartments in the wheel.  they were all mixed up and some of them were even outside the wheel in the plastic baggie and in the delivery envelope itself, so beware!!  They have a beautiful gold tone that didn't fade as I wore them.  the rigidity of these decals makes it difficult to place them securely to a nail.  What I did to aid in them staying attached to my nail is I bent them slightly, then put them in place on my design.",4
"If you have really dry skin on your hands a lot of standard lotions, with their flowery fragrances, actually sting. This fragrance-free lotion doesn't have this problem. It provides good moisturization without leaving a greasy feeling. The convenient pump makes this ideal to keep next to the kitchen sink or utility sink so you can put some on after getting your hands all wet.",5
"soft and glides on so nicely , came sealed which is a good thing i love it , and will repurchase it again for sure",5
when the sun starts coming up at 4 am I am NOT a happy person. This blocks out more light that any other of the hundreds I have used and you can freeze it for relief of tired eyes. It was like a 2 for 1  and I would recomend to anyone,5
"These brushes are really great quality. I bought them with the intention of using them to apply my foundation, however, my foundation does not go on smooth with these brushes and goes on easier with a sponge. Not the brushes fault! I use the brushes in different ways now and they really get into the corners of your face. Great purchace!",4
"My husband has been using this lotion for years, especially in winter. As a physician, he washes his hands frequently and often ends up with cracked and bleeding knuckles after a day at work.This lotion is absorbed easily, is not greasy, and the size of the container gives you a great value. He uses it before bed and by morning his hands look completely different.He's not one to use colognes and doesn't like strong scents. He and I both love the smell of this lotion. Women may also like the sandalwood-influenced scent for themselves.",5
"I love the different neutral shades, they go with everything. I can mix and match and wear a new look every day. They last all day and blend together well.",5
I love the feel of silky smooth skin and this is exactly what this product delivers.I alternate this product with the diary blue hydration masks for added moisture.This product is packed with the best topical properties on the market.I am a lifer of this moisturizer..,5
"I bought this glove to use with a clipless curling iron, needless to say it did NOT do the job! I didn't realize that on the outside of the package that said ""This glove will not protect from touching the iron plates directly"" and that's exactly how I use the curling iron.It is just like the body scrub gloves, like a scratchy mesh material, and the heat went right thru, was not able to hold a curl on the iron for more than 3 seconds or my hand was gonna get burnt. VERY disappointed about this. Sent it back and got a refund.",1
"This is the BEST conditioner I've ever used. It makes combing a breeze (which is a lot to say for my hair)! I have mid-back length slightly thick hair that tends to frizz and I love this stuff. I'll never use anything else (although I only wash my hair every 3 or so days). I especially like that it's sulfate and paraben free. Those two chemicals are horrible for your skin and hair and unfortunately, they are included in what seems to be at least 75% of hair/skin products. Amazon prices can't be beat. This conditioner is EXPENSIVE in salons.",5
"I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out. Same goes for my hair and scalp. My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas. It's been about a year and a half and I am still hooked. I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.",5
Had to shave edges to avoid my daughter getting cut. She's so excited to use it. How I wish there was a binder with slots or something to keep store them for easy access & display.,4
"This is a wonderful vitamin C serum. It is really light, unlike some of the others I've tried which can be thick, heavily scented, or just weird in general. This one is nice and thin and clean, and sinks into the skin super fast so you can apply your moisturizer quickly after. The fact that it is basically scentless is great for my sensitive skin, and it has kept my skin nice and tight, even while on vacation to the beach. I'd definitely repurchase!",5
I'm 18 and have dark circles under my eyes from a lack of sleep haha and this concealer does exactly what it's supposed to do. The yellow concealer is for dark circles and it covers mine beautifully. I only need a small amount because a little goes a long way. I use a concealer brush to blend it and it's perfect under foundation or when I wear tinted moisturizer. It lasts all day for me and doesn't make my skin oilier (I have oily skin). This tiny jar will last me a lifetime!,5
"when i first saw it online, i thought the color was going to be super dark and should be used as a bronzer instead of a blush. but after trying it on, i am soo in love with this product. it is light, the texture is very very soft and is pretty pigmented. this color has a tad of pink and is very shimmery. this has definitely became one of my favorite face products.",5
"I love Dove products and generally have good luck with them. I'm just not particularly sure about this one. I'm a bit confused by what exactly it's supposed to do. Apparently it's for dry, brittle hair and it's supposed to leave it silky and shiny. I've used it on damp hair, leaving it to air dry and blow drying it. Both times I didn't notice a significant difference in quality or texture. I have thick, long wavy hair that gets frizzy easily and appears dry at times at the ends. Nothing has worked. While this product does a fine job of not leaving my hair greasy feeling or smelly, I'm just not sure it's working as advertised.",3
I was a little leary since I buy most of my makeup from sephora. I didn't know if this would be authentic but it is!  It blends sheer. you need very very little (little bit bigger then the tip of the tube but not by much and it will do both eyes). Product sets quick and is very blendable.  The great thing I just purchased this and I got it very quick!! Super excited and the first day I used it was the hottest/humid day we have had and no budge on my eye shadow.  Its a must try for a great price! THANK U!!,5
"I'm not even kidding. Not only does it smell like cupcakes, but the color lasts-- I mean, I wore it last night, woke up with still red lips, scrubbed my lips with a toothbrush, and there's still some color left. You just can't beat it. And the color is amazing. I wore it to a rockabilly movie premiere and got so many compliments on it.",5
I love the Deva Curl products.  They are gentle on my hair and skin but very effective. You should try them.,5
"Nice brushes, although just a bit stingy in size.  Appear to be well made and look as though they will hold up well with use.",4
"I use fake lashes to give extra volume to my lashes but sometimes it's just too much of a hassle. This is the only mascara that comes close to the results i get with the fake lashes. Truly, no other brand works this well. Some people complain that it's clumpy, but this brand isnt for a clean look, it's for a false lash effect! Anyway, dont love the price, but i have to use four times as much of the drugstore brand to even come close to this, so it's even.",5
"In general, I'm not a big devotee of skin care serums. Most are geared towards dry skin, and I have normal-to-oily skin. Since a tiny bit of light lotion is way more than enough to moisturize my skin, I don't feel any burning desire to include another product that would just increase the speed with which my face goes from &#34;balanced&#34; to &#34;oily.&#34;In that regard, I absolutely love the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum. It is almost unbelievably light and perfectly fast-absorbing. In fact, for my skin, I could almost skip moisturizer when I use this and would actually prefer how my skin feels. It absorbs completely leaving no feeling of product on my skin in a matter of minutes - I can't say I've ever used any other product on my face that didn't sit on my skin, leaving a heavy, coated feeling (even moisturizers don't seem to soak in on me no matter how light they are). I've been using it daily, and it hasn't left me feeling oily any earlier in the day than usual and may even be helping to keep it balanced and normal longer. Since I don't have even remotely dry skin nor do I have much along the lines of wrinkles to speak of, I can't really attest to any anti-aging benefits it might have, but the mere fact that it seems to keep me from getting as oily as usual is more than enough benefit for me to continue using it as part of my daily routine.Unfortunately, my thoughts aren't all positive. The packaging this serum comes in feels decidedly cheap. I actually had to play with it a bit - untwisting and re-closing it a couple of times - just to get the pump working to dispense the product. Even though it has a silver look, the pump is totally plastic and feels flimsy, even moreso than a drugstore skincare product's packaging. Thankfully I could get it working, so at least there's that. And I do prefer pumps over tubs or other styles of packaging that require you to actually touch the product inside to get it out - a pump is the most hygienic way to dispense skin care. I do have to wonder how long the pump will hold up, though, given how cheap it seems. I also have my doubts about how much of the product I'll be able to dispense with this pump and how much would be wasted if I don't open it up at the end.If only the pump didn't feel so cheap, I'd be all over this product. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing if there are any long-term benefits to using it (say, a more even skin tone), but even if there aren't, I adore how it makes my skin feel instantly, keeping oiliness at bay without being able to feel a trace of it on my face.",4
"This smells okay at first--lemony and slightly floral, like a magnolia, and goes on cool. Unfortunately, it is kind of shiny/sticky, and the smell becomes just floral and lingers even after scrubbing in a shower hours later after workout--I suppose this means it's still working, but of course, you're supposed to re-apply far more frequently. It also feels kind of heavy after sweating--as if your skin can't breathe and has plastic film on it.It is only SPF 30, so apply it heavily. Be careful not to breathe it in either--it says to use with plenty of ventilation, but 15 minutes before you go outside. It is useful to get your back, but I'd be wary if you are prone to bacne--it's hard to get it off!I prefer a dry-touch sunscreen for sports--or life, and an unscented one if possible.",3
"I was very satisfied with how quickly the package arrived. I haven't yet tried to apply them. I have never worn false eyelashes so I bought these to practice with. I did notice that they seem wider, from side to side than the eyelashes one can buy at the store (such as Ardell). I guess I will have to cut a bit from the end. Some of them are EXTREMELY thick, almost like costume eyelashes but all in all you really can't go wrong for the price. I gave the product three stars because I will have to cut them, otherwise it would have been four.",3
I got this as a present for my dad and he loves it!  It was just as nice as the picture makes it out to be.  It's solid wood so it's sturdy.  We didn't have any problem with the lid as referenced in other reviews and were able to find soap to fit it without a problem.  I would recommend it for any classy gentleman.  Makes a nice gift!,5
"I love this stuff!  I use it with my Trinity NuFace instead of the gel that comes with it.  It's light, not sticky and way more economical!",5
"This was well received by my husband, the toughest critic around! He said it was easy to use, felt great and was refreshing and soothing.No dry skin, no residue and one happy husband.",5
"I am an artist and I have to say that this is fabulous!!!  As we all know we must keep out brushes with the tip down and this works well, especially since one Kolinsky hair brush will cost you about $300!!!!! I have the mini tree for my regular size rushes up to 12 and this one has larger circles for my brushes with thick handles, for instance my Da Vinci Mix B in size 30.The only thing is I wish it was twice as tall, but then again it was made for cosmetic not art brushes and the handles on cosmetic brushes are only about 5&#34; tall, where as mine  an be as tall as 12&#34;.To whoever sells this, you should list it in the art section under paint brushes, you will sell a tone of them I am sure.",5
"GREAT PRODUCT,,BUT I OREDERED THE WRONG KIND..DUH ON ME..LOL..I WANTED FULL AND NOT TIPS..BUT THEY ARE SO DURABLE AND WORTH IT.. I KEPT THEM..CANT BEAT THE QUALITY OR PRICE..THANK U",5
these are so totally cool! its easy to put the puddy in for the molding and they stick in really well! its awesome to have around.,5
"Before I bought this product, I read a lot of bad reviews on the scraper. But after trying this stamper set out, I thought the scraper worked just fine! Love how easy it is to use this product:D It took me a only a couple of tries to get the hang of this...",5
"I have always had good clear skin with very few wrinkles (now age 67) and I would love to keep that look for as long as possible.  Last few years I have noticed a few very DRY spots and of course, a few deeper wrinkles as well as wrinkles around my eyes.  I read about this product on line but especially loved the natural ingredients.  I have been using it for about one month now and really FEEL as well as SEE a difference!  I will not be using anything else for the rest of my life - my skin feels naturally lubricated and comfortable.  I see a change in an old scar, and especially in one area that looked like an old pimple that never healed.  GONE!  The dry areas are gone, the wrinkles are less noticable.  What more could you ask for?",5
"When I need to reposition a round brush while drying my hair, I lay the running hairdryer on my counter. As a result, anything lightweight blows away. This Holder Caddy is the perfect solution. I hang it on the side of a drawer, so I can quickly slip my hairdryer into it when I need both hands. When finished with my hair, I put it in a drawer until the next time. It doesn't collapse flat (measures 3 1/2&#34; when folder), but for the grief it saves me during the drying process, I moved something less important in one of my drawers to make room for it. It's extremely well made and attractive.",5
Got one of these for myself and the boyfriend. We both love it. The bristles are just rigid enough and the grip is just the right size.,5
"Awesome soap - it smells good, it's all natural, and while it's not the perfectly ""smooth"" soap you find some big soap companies bragging about, the slight grit feels better.  Would recommend this stuff to anyone.  In fact, I've given a couple bars to people I know, and they've enjoyed it, too.  Try this stuff out (it comes in small packs) - doesn't hurt to try, but it may become your new favorite soap!",5
"I am terrible about what fragrances I wear.  I can't stand sweet or musk or flowery stuff. I just wanted a clean scent and I finally found it! It is the perfect blend of clean and unit still femine. THe D&G Light Blue is clean with just a tiny, tiny touch of citrus if you are really smelling it.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  It is not heavy so you do need to use it generously.  My only complaint is you need a mid day touch up and the scent does fade by then, but other than that this is the clean, great smelling fragrance you are looking for!",5
It has done a really good job keeping my skin hydrated and i have noticed a decrease in breakouts since using this product.It hasn't fully prevented my breakouts but i think it helps.,4
"Two things I usually dislike about sunscreens - the smell and the greasy feel - are absent from this lotion. It goes on very easily and makes my skin feel soft, and it's totally unscented (to me, at least) - no chemical or coconut smell. I spent several hours outdoors without getting any tan or redness on my face. It didn't sting, either.",5
these eyeliners are the best ever! I have used many brands and these last long and the colors are very vibrant!,5
"Just like what they have at the salon. It is really easy to use. I just really like my nails pretty short so that I dont jam my fingers so much, and its hart to make them that short when you can only use this to where it makes the nail just a bit longer than the fingertip, cause that is as far as you can press it. But I do really like it.",5
"I use this stuff on scars and it works amazing.  I know it's probably not real vitamin E oil, but whatever is in it works great for me!",5
"I've been using 2&#34; straighteners basically since I started straightening my hair and I love the size, so I avoid the smaller straighteners like the plague. I generally stick to the $30-40 price range so this is a bit more than I would normally spend, especially as I honestly don't ever see a difference between the straighteners I've owned and the pricey ones I've used when visiting friends or family. And no, I didn't really see a difference between this one and the $40-ish Remington straightener that I've been using for years. I definitely didn't see a difference in how frizzy my hair was, and I used my own straightening spray when I used this straightener, as well.Bottom line: This is a good straightener. It heats up fast, it IS a bit more streamlined than my older and cheaper Remington, and I like that it beeps when it's heated up all the way, Though I (thankfully) haven't had to use the safety feature where it turns itself off after an hour, that is by far the best thing about this straightener. I'm just not sure that it's worth $90-ish when you can get other good Remington straighteners (with perhaps a couple less gimmicks to them) for half the price.",3
"Ok, first I have had a lot of eyelash curlers. This is definitely the nicest one I've ever seen. It is well made and really easy to use. I've had less expensive ones and can clearly see the difference a couple of bucks makes. This is a really nice beauty tool.It works as a curler. It didn't make my eyelashes look dramatically longer, but it does make them more noticeable. And they seem to maintain the curl for a while.It comes in a cute box with a thank you card for being a gorgeous customer. Clever and would make a nice gift.Sample provided without obligation. My opinions are my own, strongly held and if something sucks I will say so.",5
My daughters are both performers in an Oldies music show [...]Due to the stage lights and distances of the performances they wear the fake lashes.  These are definately showy!!!Takes a bit more glue than the Revlon do because the band is a bit thicker and stiffer -- however they are definately going to hold up to more shows than the Revlon which are usually only good for 1-2 showsThese should last quite awhile!!,5
"I was contacted by Aria to test this product and I received a complimentary sample of the product. All opinions included in this review are my honest opinions on the product.I'm really specific about facial moisturizers and skincare treatments. Many facial moisturizers that I've used have no helpful anti aging ingredients, and this one is loaded with them, namely hyaluronic acid, 5 different types of peptides, silk amino acids, aloe, and Vitamin C just to name a few.So far, my experience with this moisturizer has been great. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but I do have expression lines around my mouth which bother me a lot. My skin isn't as lustrous as I want it to be, since I tend to be a little bit dry.Used in conjunction with their  Collagen Tri-Peptide Firming Serum, my skin has gotten a lot better. I don't have dryness anywhere, and my skin is definitely smoother as a result. I think the restorative age defying results come from skin that is well moisturized and better able to receive and absorb the nutrients and anti-aging ingredients in this moisturizer.In addition to my skin getting a little more soft and smooth, it is also more supple and firm in the areas around my eyes, my mouth, nasolabial folds (the outer smile line that connects with the nostrils when you smile) and on my chin and neck. It took about 3 weeks for me to notice this, but I'll definitely continue using this product to see how much better it will get!I'm not that easy to please when it comes to skincare, but this moisturizer has given me great quality results for my thirsty and sometimes difficult skin.",5
"This was a fabulous purchase on my part. So glad I got it. The close up mirror is perfect for makeup application. I even find my husband using it to look at his face close-up! The chrome color is great. It was easy to attach to the wall. The only thing is with the constant turning of the mirror around and around, the little nobs on the two sides get loose, so just make sure to tighten them every once in a while.",4
Best eyeshadow brushes/detail brushes I&#8217;ve used. They&#8217;re perfect for the everyday eyeshadow users. The brow brush is perfect and gentle.,5
Love it. Just wish the replacement brushes weren't so expensive.  It is a good investment for your skin and makes your cleansers last a lot longer.,5
"This is my favorite foundation, and I've tried a quite a few including some more expensive ones. The fact that it is liquid is nice, because it never looks cakey.  It's not too thin, but it doesn't have great coverage so if you have skin problems like me you'll need a concealer as well.  After I've been using the product for years, I've seen it on numerous beauty lists as a drugstore match to higher end products.It has SPF 15 which is nice, but I also wear a 30 SPF moisturizer (eucerin) as well, because I'm paranoid about sun damage and because you still need moisturizer with this, especially in the winter.",5
"After going to a natural, organic nail salon, the manicurist stated that she only uses crystal nail files and I loved on smooth and sculpted my nails looked. Unlike paper/grit files, you can file your nails with crystal back and forth in both directions, allowing for more fineness and precision shaping. I love the way my nails feel and the three different sizes are great to keep one in your purse and one in your office (or for travel).",4
"I decided to purchase this lipstick after reading an article in a magazine. I am very glad I did the color seem to be very bright in the tube, but once it was put on it looked very sheer with a hint of color. The texture was very smooth and it was not sticky.  you can't beat the price either in the stores this costs appx eight dollars.  I got it here on amazon for a little over five dollars!  Also this item came to me very quickly I will definitely be buying this again.",5
"I liked this powder at first because it goes perfectly with my very fair british skin tone. (I have the translucent one) But I realized after a little while that it made my face look somewhat cakey.I don't wear a lot of make, I just put this powder over my skin79 BB cream and I like having the feeling that I don't wear any make up but you can definitely see this powder on the skin. My boyfriend always made a comment on how dry my skin looked when I was wearing it so I'm changing for an other one. I'll probably try an other mineral wear powder from Physician Formula since I like this brand and the fact that they don't use talc.",3
"This color is so light it looks clear, very classy for wedding or just a natural nail look.  Love the product but the color looks more pink than it really is.",4
Needed a dual voltage hair dryer for Europe. Can't believe how tiny it is and how well it works. Perfect for travel.,5
"I have some scars near the front of my scalp from a forehead lift where my hair didn't grow back plus my hair is thin in the crown.  I had tried Joan Rivers' product for it, but I didn't like the colors or the way it looked.  Also it seemed to have a toxic effect.This product did a lot better job of covering the bald and thinning spots plus there was no toxicity that I noticed.  I'd say the product is nearly perfect except that it's a little hard to put on.  I think a brush is needed, but I'd rather use my own than have a new brush come with every reorder if it raises the price.",4
"I bought this because I finish my morphs brushes concealer palette and I thought this would be the same but is not , this is horrible it doesn't have coverage at all the consistency is super greasy it almost feels like lip gloss and the palette is really smallDon't waste your money buying this",1
"I've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product.",5
"I've never used hairspray before, but recently I decide to try it and see if it would help hold my curls in. I have naturally straight-ish hair with a little bit of a wave to it, but I've never been able to keep curls in for more than a few hours. So I bought a small travel size can of Frizz Ease at Walmart, gave my side bangs a bit of curl and sprayed. The curl froze and didn't move for the next 12 hours.But seriously, my sisters all hate this hair spray, they say it makes my hair crispy, and I agree with them. The smell gives me headaches and I keep spraying myself in the eye with it. It doesn't ""mist"" like other people say hairspray ought to do either. It holds VERY well, too well if you ask me. I am now on the lookout for a ""pliable"" hairspray that won't make me feel like I just slathered glue all over my head. But if I ever need a super duper strong hair glue, you can be sure this will be at the top of my list. :)",2
"I have bought better brushes from Wal-Mart.I got them this morning and they were already shedding and I had to throw the fan brush away. The brush roll that it comes in is pretty good, but I don't know if it's exactly worth waiting and paying for shipping.",1
This product is easy to use and works on my hair as it claims.  Not greasy and dries fast and makes My hair feel a little thicker.,5
"Very nice!  I cannot wear a wig without these, since I have tons of long hair.  After watching a youtube tutorial on how to get all my hair under a wig cap, I can wear wigs just like the short haired folks :)",5
i love this producti love this producti love this producti love this producti love this productI think this might be the best eyeliner I have ever used - It never moves when I am at work!!! love it!,5
"I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE THIS PERFUME! IT IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME OUT THERE... AND AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT ONES. THIS WAS IS THE &#34;VERY&#34; BEST OF ALL THOUGH (WELL FOR ME ANYWAYS). THERE ISN'T A TIME WHEN I WEAR THIS SMELL, THAT I DO NOT GET A COMPILMENT FROM SOMEONE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL. IT WAS SHIPPED WHEN IT SAID IT WOULD TOO. I RECOMMEND AND I GIVE IT 5 STARS.",5
"The texture is amazing, the light touch of glitter. Just absolutely love it!! I also bought the silver one ""solitaire"" even better than this color, I love them both just one better than the other haha",5
"Out of the multiple brands of moisturizing facial sunscreen I've used, this is one of my favorites.Likes:- Light but not runny, soaks in quickly.- Packaging.  Great little flat squeeze bottle with a top that screws on securely.  Very compact and good for travel.Dislikes:- Scent is nice, but maybe a bit powerful to me.  I asked a friend and they liked the scent.Other Thoughts:- ""Luminous"".  I tested the claim of ""illuminating minerals"" by putting this on half of my face, waiting 30 minutes, then asking someone which side they thought looked different and how.  The side I put the lotion on was a bit glossier.  Not shiny or full gloss, but just a very slight satin sheen.- Small amount of lotion.  This is only 1.7 oz (50 ml) of lotion.  I like the size for travel though, and it does go a long way.",5
"I have used Buf Puf since high school (I am now in my 50's) and I always get compliments on the smoothness of my skin. This sponge keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which contributes to that &#34;aged&#34; look.",5
I will buy again! The container alone is worth the price of all. I dont worry if there are 50-100 missing.,5
IT LOOK GRAY BUY NICE COLOR RICH COLOR FOR THE PRICE I BUYING MORE OF COLOR IT LAST A LONG TIME WONT CHIP,5
"I bought this set month ago when I was building my makeup brush sets and did not want to spend a lot of money on them. I decided to give this set a try since it seemed affordable and reviews were not poop. Well...I personally dislike those brushes. They come in wrapped in plastic, smell horrible. Right off the back they start shedding even after you wash them first time around. Within a week of usage the handles started to come off...Bristles are not the softest especially on the face brushes. Honestly those brushes are very cheaply made :( Although I regret ever buying and using them, they taught me to value a good quality hence expensive brush. I used this set for 2 weeks and then it went to the trash. I came on Amazon and bought the Coastal Scents set which is 100 times better than elf brushes.",2
My Maybelline Falsies Volume Express mascara adds length and volume a lot faster than this mascara.  I bought this based on the good reviews I read on line but was disappointed.,3
"I have been mixing shea butter and oils in my natural hair care recipes and noticed that they were not quite the consistency I wanted. Also, they were not helping me to retain the moisture I needed throughout the day.After researching this product's many uses, I purchased it mainly to add to my moisturizing sprays and spritzers for me and my daughter. I have noticed a major difference in terms of how my hair retains moisture throughout the day. It acts as a humectant (like honey) pulling moisture towards the hair shaft.One thing to note, this product is not supposed to be used as an oil or other topical hair treatment. It should be mixed with water (equal amounts) so that the molecules in the glycerin are attached to water molecules when applied to hair. Always research your mixes and make sure that you do not cause any damage to your tresses by under moisturizing.",5
I purchased this for my boyfriend who was complaining about having chaffing in the armpit area. He was originally using my Monistat Soothing Cream but he seemed to like that more than this product. He preferred the texture of the monistat product than the minting substance of this product.,2
This plate is awesome however i was bummed to find out I could of gotten one ALOT cheaper than this one from another company. Konad is over priced. Bundle monster is a great alternative for half the price.,3
I use this ever morning and my skin has never felt better!,5
"Love the mascara, and the eyeliner is pretty good too, but the makeup will come out too far quite frequently. I was actually able to get it to screw back down, but it's hard. I also wish it could be sharpened. Seller was great though, and I use the mascara everyday.",4
"Because I've used rogain for so many years I thought I'd try this.  I've only used it for a month but I think my hair is thicker and growing more baby hairs.  I might take the advise of another reviewer and switch each month.  This is a little thicker than the watery Rogain, but I like it much better this way.",4
Easy to use ..basic big toothe comb...stays in the shower constantly to use with conditioner ..still looks great ..no complaints .,5
"did not like this product, eye shadow wont stay on the brush... bad quality, i guess its for littke girls",1
"I have been needing a small spray bottle for a long time.  I have rubbing alcohol in mine.  I use it here where it is hot and humid to refresh my skin and find that this little spray bottle is perfect.  It puts out a fine mist and the alcohol mists onto my skin and evaporates rapidly, providing a nice, cooling sensation.  I find that the mist is fine enough for my purpose and am quite happy with this.",5
"I really like this nail polish. It gives my nails a nice, clean look and the color goes with everything.",5
"Got my five stars,  just has advertise, it dries fast and a very nice high shine.  Use it on my toes 4 weeks ago, and it is still very shining.  Will continue to purchase and I highly recommend this product.",5
Didn't see any improvement while using this product. Will try to find something else that will help tighten up facial skin.,3
"I can't say enough good things about the Clear Scalp & Hair line. The product delivers exactly what it claims to do...beautiful, clean hair. The shampoo is creamy and silky with a very rich lather. It rinses well without a filmy residue left behind. The scent is light and pleasing and not overpowering like some leading shampoos on the market. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I wish it came in a bigger size! Definitely worth the money!",5
"I thought that the high ratings meant that it would help condition my dry, overprocessed hair.  I tried it on my hair with a large professional plastic processing cap for 20 minutes and it still did not condition my long hair very well. Regular conditioners make my hair silkier than this cream does.  I did receive the product quickly.",2
"I love the smell of Sweet Almond but I do not use as much as they say we should.  It makes my hair feel greasy if I do.  The way I use it makes my hair very smooth and it feels great. Also its easier to style when I leave a little in as a conditioner. I have recommended it to several of my friends with differing results.  Some love it, others not so much.  I will probably be using it for a long time! :)",5
"Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo is a good shampoo, but really nothing special. The ""youth renewal"" claim should just be ignored because this isn't the Fountain of Youth for hair. The shampoo has a very strong fragrance which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on your preference. After using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, my normal-dry hair does feel soft and not greasy. I like Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo, but it's very high price might make me look at other quality shampoos that cost much less.",4
I thought I was buying a product that a friend recommended and I got the wrong one. It isn't a bad tanning lotion but I have used much better bronzers than this.,3
"I am a middle-aged guy who suffers from genetic drooping of skin under my eyes. A plastic surgeon told me, basically, to just live with it because surgery would cause other, worse problems for my situation. I have tried Neocutis Lumiere and found it did nothing for my problem. This gel works well. If I apply it in the morning when I first arise, it does reduce the drooping. Not dramatically, of course, but noticeably and more rapidly than anything else I've tried, and far more than doing nothing. It has a almond scent, which I suspect is a cover-up of offending odors, but it's not a problem if one expects it and it disipates. And BTW, all these non-aerosol products with pump mechanisms can be opened up with pliers. Always, there are several days of applications left in the bottle. Follow up 6/14: I have increased my rating to 5 stars. I have now been using it form several months and I find it increasingly effective as time goes on. No, it won't make up for an evening of too much salt, wine, or insufficient sleep (BTW, I have discovered that melatonin pills may make under eye sagging worse). And a little bit goes a long way, so it is actually economical.",5
"Just tried this for the first time and when I smelled it in the store, it smelled like pure berries and I loved it so I got it.  But when I got it home, I gave my hands and arms a good washing with it - just because I wanted to smell like all those berries!  That's when the confusion came:  I smelled like...roses and almonds.  So, confused, I read the ingredients for the first time and saw rose extract and almond extract - which is fine; it's not why I bought it, but it smells really nice.So I empathize for all of the reviewers who actually did read and expect to smell like roses, but only smelled like berries.. :)  I wish I had your bottle, and you had mine, but alas, we must wash with what we have been given..!  It must depend on skin chemistry.But it is lathers well, rinses clean and leaves skin soft.  Not as soft as some other Oil of Olay body washes that I've tried, but then again, I'm an old lady, so it's probably just me ""shriveling."" ;)",4
"Being the brave (and possibly crazy) person that I am, I decided to switch up my color 5 days before I was going to a wedding, which is when you are guaranteed for something to go wrong.  Step 1 was easy enough - all over color.  No problems there, the color was (and still is) a very vibrant reddish brown, with a little more red than I was expecting, but nothing alarming.  Step 2 was something I hadn't tried yet - highlights.  They give you 2 applicators for this, one that looks like a big mascara wand, and one that's like a mini pair of tongs with bristles for really getting the highlights ON.  I think I chose the wrong one of the 2 by choosing the tongs.  I mean, everything went on well enough, and the blue tint helps you see where you've actually applied them so you can space them easily (helpful!), but when I rinsed my hair less than 15 minutes later, the highlighted sections were BRIGHT ORANGE, not the gentle lighter red shown on the box.  Not the natural look I was going for at all.  After having a few people tell me ""it's not THAT bad"" I decided to give it a couple days to see if I could get used to it, but eventually it evened out and didn't look as harsh.  They're still much brighter than I think they should be, but when I try again I'll leave it in for a MUCH shorter time and use the mascara wand instead.It's worth noting that several days later it was still rinsing out of my hair (it would run clear, and then do the same thing the next day) and I fear I stained a few hotel pillowcases, but the color has held up well and I plan to stay this color for a while now.  Just hopefully with non-orange highlights.",4
"Basically, it seems like it is a white coating but it doesn't fade anything at all. Plus, if you stop using, your color will return instantly.Also, it made me break out pretty badly. If you have sensitive skin, beware.",3
"I have very dry hair/scalp with thin hair.  Lately the itching from my dry scalp is driving me nuts, so I decided to give the Clear scalp and hear therapy a try.Pros- It takes away the dryness/itching, although for only a short period of time.- it softens my hair- the bottle is easy to use and easy to apply.Cons:- This treatment can only be used for a short amount of time because it weights down my hair.  I can only really use this product in e house as it makes my hair so greasy.- the results are not long lastingOverall this product is decent, but not the write type for my hair.  This product is probably best for those with thick hair, dry hair.",3
These stamped okay and had nice designs.,4
"I really like the weight of this lotion.  It's very light, soaks in quickly, and leaves nothing sticky, shiny, or tacky on your skin.  The scent is quite pleasant and not overpowering at all for the few minutes that it lasts.  The pump spout was broken off on my bottle when it arrived, but I just unscrewed one from an old bottle of lotion I had laying around and it works fine.  There is A LOT of product in this bottle and since the coverage is so good it's lasting me a long time.",4
i love that there are three sizes for this hair tool. don't settle with a boring ponytail. perfect office hair,5
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair conditioner.I use it once a week on my scalp.Be fore-warned that a little goes a long way.  It melts into the hair and scalp at room temperature.  It does make your hair so soft.  Since it has castor oil, there is a strong aroma, but it's not a bad one.",5
"I just received these nail bows today I ordered them in the beginning of the month and shipping took a little long but it was worth it !!! They are the perfect size, very well made, and reusable !!! Everyone is complaining that it only comes with ten bows when it says twenty in the name. Well if you read the description it says it comes with 10 bows. And I do not mind that ! They are very sturdy so I can reuse them over and over again !!! Will defiantly be ordering again !!!",5
"Hair colorists always recommend the use of haircolor-preserving shampoos and conditioners as well as coming back between full colorings to have the color freshened up. This product does the latter very well, and in doing so, saves one quite a lot of money when compared to the cost of getting the similar treatments at a salon.If you are not sure which color to get, the John Frieda website has a compatibility list of most hair color makes and shades so that you can find the one that best matches yours. I use Olia hair color, which is unfortunately not on the list, but if you find that your color is missing from the list as well, there are enough other colors listed to give you a good idea of the right shade to choose. The color I chose worked well with mine and gave it a significantly refreshing boost.Hair coloring is a notoriously tricky business since there are so many different types and colors of hair. I don't know if this works on all types of hair equally well, especially hair that is more resistant to processing, but I think it's definitely worth a try. If it works for you, it will save you a bundle versus all of those in-between color salon visits.One caveat is that this product may cause stains, so be careful to thoroughly and immediately rinse any surfaces that it comes into contact with.",5
"I fell asleep on this one by ""not"" reading the ingredients prior to ordering. Why would the seller put so many artificial and synthetic ingredients in with something as beneficial and natural as manuka honey. Before ordering this product check out the ingredients in the soap. I took off a star for the unnatural ingredients (one of them is perfume) and the small size of the soap. Otherwise, you can detect the manuka honey in the smell of the soap and the moisturizing properties. Will ""NOT"" reorder.",3
Not my favorite eye makeup remover.... It is a bit oily and I was still left with raccoon eyes after using it. I will not purchase this kind again,2
"For those with sensitive eyes and skin, it's essential to find mascara that doesn't clump excessively and that refrains from irritating the eyes. While skin sensitivities are clearly a highly personal and unique matter, Ecco Bella Brown mascara was the first mascara that has ever worked for me without in some way causing irritation to my skin and eyes. I am also thrilled with the ease by which I am able to control how much mascara is applied at any one time, so there is no risk of clumping lashes together.This mascara is the perfect color to complement my eyelashes, and I found it even works as a means for coloring sun-bleached eyebrows, when carefully applied in moderate quantities. It's wonderful to know that this mascara is natural and organic... something that those with sensitive eyes and skin will rejoice in, as they are able to wear it free from pain and irritation.Ecco Bella brown mascara comes with a completely surprising and very delightful feature -- a mirror built right in to the side of the bottle, so it's always easy to see how much mascara is being applied, even if there's no wall mirror available at the moment.Ecco Bella Brown Mascara is the perfect long-lasting, non-irritating mascara for blondes and light brunettes who wish to be able to carefully control the amount of mascara they apply without clumping. It's awesome!",5
"I am particular about my hair and have to carefully find the correct brush.  This brush is unlike the picture. This is a mini brush  and must be designed for very small children. The measurements indicates a brush that is almost 7"" but the brush I received is only about 4""....don't buy this if you're wanting a full size hair brush. I am giving it four stars on the basis that they sent the wrong brush.",4
This was a huge hit !! My teenage son used this product and just bought another this week because he said he worked well to keep the acne away. He is a hockey player who needs a good face wash product after wearing an helmet everyday and sweating. When your teenage goes to store to buy a product all on his own -- I would say this product works.,5
"I don't know if I like this dryer or not.  My first impression is that it's too heavy.  Perhaps that's necessary because of the more powerful motor.  However, it's really too heavy for me and I have to take a break from drying when my arm gets tired.  It does have more power than a drugstore brand, but I'm not sure how much faster it dries my hair.  A little, I guess.  And I do think it makes it a little shinier.  I don't like the placement of the switches - too easy to change them by accident. And it's not very quiet - same as my old cheap one.  All in all it's a step up from a drugstore brand, but as it's my first ""expensive"" blowdryer, I expected more.  I would still recommend it over the cheaper brands, but I wonder if there is a high-end dryer out there that is lighter, quieter and better than this one.",3
"AMAZING, very silky, very creamy, very pigmented and very very BEAUTIFUL!!!",5
"This stuff is awesome.  I use it in the morning, as part of my ""beauty"" treatment.  It is super soft cream.  Feels almost like putting whipped cream on your face. I love it.  Afterward, my face just looks so radiant.  Have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I just love the way it makes my face look.I have been using the Olay products since about July 2006 and am very pleased. I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck, after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap (liquid, navy colored bottle) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night. In the morning, I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Total Effects 7x Visible Anti-Aging Vitamin Complex Cream on my entire face and neck. I think this combo, particularly the Olay Regenerist products and Total Effects, have made me look YEARS younger--with the grace of God, of course. I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about 2 months ago, and it made a difference for me. Lots of people at work tell me I look younger, too. My skin feels great! It's firm and velvet soft. And wait till I tell you, I have lost 53 pounds in the last 10 months! Why do you care? Well, my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss, especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched. I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up! Guess what??? It's firm and velvet soft. I won't say I don't own a wrinkle, but they are very very minimal. I've had people tell me I don't have wrinkles, too, but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup. Oh, I'm 58, too--so don't think I'm 25 and telling you I don't have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV.Dec 2007:  Still using it.  It's like giving your face a drink in the morning.Guys:  YOU can use this stuff too, if you want your face to look softer and firmer.  (Just don't tell the women. Most of them will talk about you like a dog.  Not me, though.  What the heck. I know there are some guys out there that actually care what they look like.)I am mighty pleased with these Olay products, BUT, use them awhile. Nuthin' happens overnight, Hon! (We call everybody Hon in Balmer, Merlin) (That translates to Baltimore, Maryland--sorry, I have an accent.)Nov 2008--still using this in morning, in combination with other Olay and Victoria Principal products.",5
"I wish that this worked.  I really wanted this to work.  Sadly, it does not work.  It seems to be sturdy and well-made, and as a straightener it does work comparably to any other straighter I've tried.  But the other two attachments simply do not work as they're supposed to.The &#34;volumizing&#34; attachment, which basically just looks like half of a round brush, didn't really do much of anything to my hair.  It looks perhaps a bit more smooth than it did to begin with but not dramatically more than just combing with a simple hair brush, and I don't feel like it added any noticeable volume to my hair at all.The final attachment that's supposed to offer &#34;loose&#34; curls was a wash too.  I knew that when they made a point of saying &#34;loose&#34; with the word highlighted and all that this was going to be more like free flowing beach waves and I didn't have a problem with that.  I rather liked the idea, actually.  But all I got was hair that was just sort of crimped in a weird way.  The problem is in the design.  You have to lay a 1-2 inch strand of hair over top the outer curling attachment and then twist the end of the strand of hair into the ceramic panels inside the straightener part.  You then twist your wrist either under or over, depending on what direction you want the curl to go, and then you pull down the length of your hair.  Anyone used to traditional curling irons is going to need a bit of practice to get the hang of this, and for someone with a lot of thick hair like myself it takes quite a while to get through your whole head 1 inch strands at a time (because 2 inches was not working in the least).The problem is that the top and middle of the strands of hair get a little wave going but the ends of the strands remains straight because while the top of the strand does get a chance to wind both through the inner ceramic panels and the outer heated curling element, thus setting the curl, the end only goes through the ceramic straightening panels and never gets to go around the heated curling unit because it's the end of your hair strand and gravity simply makes it fall out.  The only way to get the very end to wind around the outer curling attachment is to forcibly hold it there yourself but you can't because the brush is burning hot.  Maybe the problem is that I have layers and this would work better on someone whose hair is uniformly one length.  I don't know, but for me the ends just kept falling out and missed getting curled at all.",2
I used this once and i didn't feel it did anything. I stopped using it. I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.,3
My face has never looked better. I was starting to get a breakout but applied this mask and viola...breakout avoided. Now I use this weekly with apple cider vinegar as suggested on the package directions. Please be aware of slight bubbles when you add the apple cider vinegar to the clay. I wasnt expecting that but it was cool to see. Turns out my local farmers market sells this too so I will definitely purchase again.,4
"Like another reviewer, I also have weird eyelashes, my right lashes curl down over my eye, but my left side is just fine.Every mascara I've tried in the past has just pulled the curl right out of my right lashes and down go my lashes over my eye, very annoying.I bought this based on the rave reviews, it shipped literally the next day so I tried it out, didn't expect much, but to my surprise my lashes held a curl! They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.",5
This matches all of my other luggage! It was a great investment! Sturdy and beautiful. I recommended this.to everyone!Zebra print with purple trimming!,5
"I was excited to receive this product as I have sensitive skin and acne and thought this would help. However, my excitement waned when I saw witch hazel as the third ingredient. Witch hazel is a known irritant, and sure enough, this product aggrevated my rosacea. Not worth it.",1
"I really like what this cleanser does for my skin. I have spent alot of money on cleansers, from the super expensive to the really cheap ones. I am always looking for the next best thing. I never thought this non  scented simple cleanser would keep my skin balanced. It really works for me and I love it even more with my Clarisonic Cleanser.It doesnt foam as much as other cleansers but cleans my skin thorougly without overdrying",5
"The ""Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 2 Inch"" is an excellent hair styling tool, particularly for those whose hair is medium length or longer.  It is lightweight, an attractive color, and very reasonably priced.  The flat iron heats quickly; because of the 2 inch width, one pass is enough to create a smooth, shiny surface.  The ceramic flat iron plates are smooth and do not catch or pull hair.  The recommended heat settings worked well for me even on the lowest temperature in that range.  This flat iron did not get so hot that it burned my ""color-refreshed"" medium-fine hair.The controls on the ""Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 2 Inch"" are easy to use.  The buttons are not recessed and are not difficult to press.  You do need to press and hold the on-off switch for 20 seconds instead of just pressing and releasing it.  The cord attaches to the flat iron using a swivel connection.  This makes the ""Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 2 Inch"" easy to maneuver and control.  The cord never tangled or wound around itself.When the flat iron is heating up, all three bars flash; once it reaches the desired temperature, the number of bars associated with the temperature shows as solid.  It would be nice if the number of bars associated with the selected temperature flashed while the unit is heating.  Temperature increments move in 20-degree increases/decreases; most flat irons I have used use 10-degree increments.  Finally, the automatic shutoff time is one hour.  I believe a shorter time would be safer as a fire might start if something flammable was in contact with the unit for an hour.The ""Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 2 Inch"" has a four-year warranty.  That exceeds warranties on many comparably priced flat irons and is a real plus.If you are looking for a 2-inch wide flat iron, I definitely recommend the ""Remington S9620 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 2 Inch"".  I love it and think you will, too.",5
"I bought this product at my local Ulta after reading the rave reviews- I am a young student with skin that is super oily in the summer, and super dry during the winter. Add in mild acne scarring and an uneven skin tone, and you get a very troubled teen. I wasn't looking for a deep wrinkle remover, just something to make my skin bright and even- and in just two weeks I began to notice a real difference.It didn't -erase- every little spot or anything like that, but it does help. I gave it four stars because there might just be something more powerful out there, and I have been led to keep looking. I am confident that it is the best for under $15, though!#1. It evens out my skin tone! (When used in conjunction with the matching cleanser, the evening is even better)#2. Doesn't worsen oily skin. It doesn't help either, but I use  Ben Nye Luxury Powder on top and the shine is gone.#3. Moisturizes normal to dry skin. During the wintertime when my skin is extremely dry, I use the Lumene Dry Skin Radiance Cocktail first and then this, and the dryness is gone all day.If you're on a budget and want something that works, I would highly recommend this product.",4
Literally came 2 days after ordering! And it's totally true to it's color name. It matches me perfectly and has great coverage.,5
"This product rocks! The entire line is worth it's weight in gold. I think this ranks right up there with Wen, sorry Chaz but at a fraction of the price it wins hands down",5
This is great nail glue or for other things too!!! I received glass acrylic dishes on ball was broken off lid so I used this nail glue not excepting it to work for glass but BAM in just sec. it was stuck on I was Amazed I love this glue!!  ^_^,5
"I have used this Dove body wash for years and I love it.  Because it is for sensitive skin, I have no trouble using it.  I find it leaves my skin softer and more moisturized than other products I have tried.  I highly recommend this body wash.",5
"Warning: obviously this is going to be a TMI review, but looking at the product thats a no brainer.You want to use about a quarter sized amount of the product, lather it in your hands and then apply. If you use too much and dont lather it there will be a burning sensation. My advice is to apply and then rinse as fast as possible. I have a moveable showerhead, so this is pretty easy for me. Using it with a bath would be good too.Obviously this is an incredible product and very useful, I'll keep the reasons to myself though! ;)",4
Perfect nude color. I was a little leery to purchase this at first but to my surprise the application was smooth unlike my mint candle apple one. This is my favorite nude polish. Looks great on nails.,5
"There is a cheaper (smaller) size of this primer out there.  I think it's an &#34;add-on&#34; item, so take advantage of that if you're not ready to splurge on this bigger size.  But the primer is great! Smoothes into your skin perfectly, and feels SO soft.  There's no fragrance at all, and you won't need to use very much at all.  A pea sized amount is more than enough to cover your whole face.  They have several different kinds, but I like the oil-control one because it keeps my t-zone from getting too shiny underneath my make-up.  And this bottle will last for MONTHS on end, so it's a huge value versus buying it directly from BM.  Just make sure it's fulfilled by amazon.",5
I received the wrong lashes than the ones in the picture. The ones I received were short at the beginning and grew longer and flared out at the end. They're still pretty good but some of the lashes got bent.,3
"I've had better. I thought to save space on my makeup table to try this makeup mirror that doesn't have the side mirrors. I was wrong in making this choice. The side mirrors add more light to the facial area and therefore make applying your skincare and makeup more flawless. This one doesn't give off enough light, and the light selections are poor-they are not true to life and are lacking in brightness. The 5x magnification is a joke-it will magnify slightly from the standard mirror on the flip side. I'm glad I got this as an Amazon item to review and didn't waste money on it. I recommend people to get the mirrors that have the side folding mirrors attached for better lighting.",3
I feel like I've tried every curl cream on the market. Moroccan Oil is by far my favorite. It doesn't make my hair crunchy and it smells fantastic.,5
"I have long, extremely fine hair and control is difficult - sprays do not work well as they cause clumping of my hair.This product, applied as directed, works nicely to control the ""flyaway"" condition of my hair and imparts a lovely shine to my gray hair.I am very pleased with this product.",5
"My husband has used Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for a good 15 years, so I thought it would be interesting to have him try this product. After a week, I asked him what he thought and, in his typically manly-man fashion, he shrugged. ""It's OK, but I don't use it anymore,"" he said. After a bit of prodding and asking specific questions, I found out that he noticed a significant increase in the amount of hair in the shower drain after he washed his hair with this product. For this reason alone after three days he stopped using the product completely. He also commented that his hair didn't have that ""clean hair smell"" after shampooing.I will add that I purchased another CLEAR SCALP THERAPY product for my own use, and had absolutely the same problem -- a noticeable (seriously noticeable) amount of hair in the shower drain after shampooing. I don't know if this is a problem with all CLEAR products, but it has been with the two that we've tried.This will not be a product we will buy in the future, as we both found it causes serious loss of hair. I now have two full bottles of this product (one for men, one for women) and neither will be used again.",1
"I love it. It absorbs very well and can be used under foundation, resulting in a glowing skin. I would prefer that the fragrance be less perfumey but the fragrance does dissipate after a while. I am 59 and was looking for an affordable firming lotion for my puffy jaw line, and one that I didn't wind up being allergic to. I don't have fine-line wrinkles so I can't comment on that part, but this product does what it says it will do to firm up the saggy skin at the jaw line and for the dry patch I was getting on my neck under the jaw. I have noticed the differences after one week of use, and am excited to see what will happen after 4 weeks of use.Also, the cleaning towelettes are heavenly soft and work great to remove eye makeup without excessive rubbing. The cleaner didn't leave a gooey feeling in my eyes. This is the first time I've ever tried Garnier products, and I'm very happy with them. I've always used Olay products before but never found one to firm my skin like the Garnier Ultra Lift does.",5
"Bought these because I heard that boar bristles are good for stimulating the scalp and help to distribute sebum oils that your scalp produces to help encourage hair growth. First of all, the little clear &#34;porcupine&#34; prongs are LONGER than the actual boar bristles, MUCH longer. So when I went to brush my hair, the boar bristles don't even touch your scalp and  barely even touch your hair. Only the clear porcupine prongs touch your hair. I will return this immediately.",1
This has. Great not overbearing scent. It does not take over the room. The price is great if you compare it to any Brock and morder store. I have had women ask e what it was,5
"I have been eyeing a competitive power face cleansing tool, and I could never figure out why so expensive?  I mean, it's really just like an electric toothbrush only larger, right?  So when I saw this one at such a reasonable price I figured it was worth the risk.  I have been using it 3x a week since it arrived and I really love it.  My face feels really, really smooth after use and seems to be improving in appearance.",5
Dark blood red color. Appears black in some lights. If you are looking for more of a red wine color this will be too dark once you put two coats on. Essie staying power.,5
"I love this product. I am traveling for a month and a half, from place to place. No time to make arrangements to get my hair colored. I went into Sephora's, expecting my Blandi pen, which I didn't care for, but it's what they had. I have alot of grey, but my natural color was brown, and I have chunky blonde highlights. I keep my hair colored and maintained. It is kind of medium length. The lady at Sephora's sold me this  spray product. I love it. It covers very well. It is a focused sprayer, so therefore doesn't tend to spray everything brown. The light brown is too dark, but atleast it thoroughly covers my grey. Infact, I was thinking about growing my hair out, and using this product until it grows out, then going and getting it colored. That's how good a product it is. I thoroughly wash my hair, and it doesn't totally wash out, which is a good thing. The hotel sheets are white, and there's no rub off. I only spray it on the part, and also I spray it sometimes on the other roots.My issue is (2 stars or less), the size of the container. Is Ms. Hazen intending to only sell a sample size of this? How many hair washes will this small container last? If I have to buy more, due to the container being empty before I get home off of this travel assignment, I won't be happy, and will buy something else for this purpose. The small size really turns me off, and though I like the product, the size of the container might prevent me from buying more. Ms. Hazen needs to consider creating a larger bottle of this, with the same price.",2
"I'm one of those lucky people who have acne issues even though I'm in my 30s (I always joke about having a jar of ""anti-wrinkle acne cream"", oh the joy).  I also have sensitive skin, and for that I wish this facial wash didn't have any fragrance.  It's light, not a heavy perfume, but as I remove makeup it has enough time in contact with my skin to irritate and leaves my skin a bit red and tight.  The bottle says it's a calming formula, but no fragrance at all would be calming.  Because I always apply a 2% salicylic acid or 8% glycolic acid after washing my face, and following that with 5% benzoyl peroxide, I can use all the calming I can get so I avoid fragrance in my facial products.  If you have sturdier skin than I do or no family history of eczema or rosacea, perhaps you won't mind.For its cleansing ability, the first time I used it I used 6 pumps of this foam wash and it quickly dissolved into nothing as I washed my face.  It didn't feel like it was removing my makeup so I rinsed then looked in the mirror.  Sure enough, my (regular, non-waterproof) mascara and eyeliner had simply been smeared around my eyes.  I used a makeup remover wipe to see if my foundation had been removed, and it had.  But the eye makeup?  Nope.  I wet my face again and got 6 more pumps of the face wash and concentrated on removing my eye makeup only.  After a minute, I rinsed, and the black smeared makeup was still there.  Disappointing.  I tried again for a week to see if it was a fluke, but it couldn't make my eye makeup budge.If you don't wear eye makeup at all and don't have skin that is sensitive to fragrance, this foam wash might be a good option for you.",3
I really like Dr. Denese's products because I have very sensitive skin and I was getting a rash from some of my other eye creams and lotions. I switched to Dr. Denese and my rash went away and I feel like my skin looks better... I will be 49 this year and I think I look pretty good.,4
"This is an excellent product which I am now unable to buy in Australia so Amazon has come to my rescue once again. If I didn't believe it was superior to other glosses on the market, there is no way I'd pay such an exorbitant price for it. Fortunately, a little goes a long way. My hair is dry and over-processed so I do need all the help I can get. For those who have strong, healthy hair, there are excellent, cheaper options available.",4
"So freaking cute! Zebra? How perfect. This is a great, sturdy case with a place to organize everything. Perfect for on-site jobs.",5

Great color shine and dry time I like itI would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.,5
i chose this lotion for its good ingredients for my sons eczema.  didnt seem to really help much and it dries out to quickly.  its a good everday lotion but I wouldnt recommend for eczema.  we had better results with welda cream and cetaphil,4
I do not like how it smells.. Smells like something old like my grandma's makeup. I am asian and have a very light beige skin tone.I stayed under the sun with sunblock and I got darker.  My face got darker than the rest of my body.  I do not know if this product  is to blame but i had a hat on and my arms and legs which were pretty exposed did not get too dark. I'd give it a couple more days and see how it works..IF my husband doesn't complain about the smell.,2
"I love this leave-in conditioner.  It moisturizes the scalp and puts volume in hair.  It's very easy to comb hair and let dry in place, and then it stays all day.  And it's not at all greasy.",5
I have been using this for about 5 months. It works great. I usually mix it with my moisturiser and 2 drops of hyaluronic acid. The reason I give 4 stars is it is hard to handle (especially in the busy morning!),4
"This is a eye shadow base but I also use it to lighten up around my eyes and that all works well.If u are looking for this to cover anything ,IT WON'T!Not for under eye circles, if u'r looking for that type of thing.",4

I actually considered it to be my (After Shower) Oil/Glycerin to soften and lighten my skin plus that soft fresh body smell that this Pink Glycerin gave it to me. I tried from ""Fair & White"" line almost every thing now; the Serum in the Aluminum bottles, the gel tubes, the Soaps and the Glycerin. Well, I think that my next step would be the concentrated Serum in the brown glass bottle. And for sure I will update you guys once I am satisfied with the results.",5
I love this polish remover. I won't use anything else. Leaves fingers/toes feeling refreshed and not all dried out with yucky white dried spots left behind.,5
Works great on mature sensitive skin. My skin feels very smooth and it seems to minimize lines in the eye area. I would certainly buy this in the future.,5
"For me, it compares to the most expensive out there. I love it and have recommended it to my friends.",5
I was really hoping that this would work for me. Seemed like an easy fix and who doesnt like easy...whelp try try again,3
This is the first time I've tried a dry shampoo and am very pleased with this product.,5
"I bought this gel starter kit in Walgreens about 6 months ago, and I love it! Since purchasing, I have used this kit to give myself a manicure about every 1-2 weeks.  While I have run out of the nail polish that came with the original set, I am still using the LED light with new polish, and it is still working perfectly!After using this product and seeing how easy it is to give myself gel manicures from the comfort of my own home, I can't go back to regular (non-gel) polish!My only complaint is that the LED light is not quite big enough to fit my whole hand, so I have to do my thumbs separately...which can be a pain.  Overall, I would definitely recommend!",5
"we liked this one since it has all antural hair, compare to the one for $100 s , I rather get this one. the color of my pouch was gold, however I wish I had a choice for pouch color. its sent to you randomly. unless you call them and ask for specific colors. beside all of these, quality is not questionable,hairs are  perfectly glued to the hadnle and since last week, I dont see any sign of damage or sepration on hairs. they are very soft and trendy, I do recommend this item.",5
"This serum is excellent. I've been using it with my matching eyecream and my face is finally feeling younger again. It leaves my skin SUPER moisturized and feeling refreshed morning and night. It's very lightly scented, which I find is great for my sensitive skin. I also only need a few pumps of it for full face and neck coverage which is a big plus in my book! Oz naturals definitely is one of my FAVORITES for skin care and this product is probably my second favorite next to the eyecream.",5
"This is my second bottle. I like to spray a little on my dry hair before I comb. The smell is a little bit too strong. Anyway, just a little spray. It moisturizes the hair well.",4
"My husband has bad psoriasis on his scalp. Nothing made the flaking go away until this shampoo. He only has to wash his hair every other day and no more snow storm on his shirt. I am not a fan of all the ingredients. Sodium lauryl sulfate is bad. It has a lot of chemicals in it. We try to do no chemicals in anything. Since this works so well, he will continue to use it but less frequently. The nice thing about this is it is a shampoo/conditioner combo. It timgles the scalp for a refreshing wash.",3
"EDIT: I think it's worth acknowledging the nearly unanimous five-star reviews on Amazon, and the discrepancies that arise from it. I cannot say anything about paid, sponsored, or ""fake"" reviews, but I know for sure Day by Day has used Tomoson to promote the product. I personally received a free bottle of Day by Day's Vitamin C serum through that site, but I was NOT paid to write a review; however, some bloggers or reviewers may have received monetary compensation--I cannot tell you which ones, but just keep in mind some PR-friendly reviewers do choose to receive payment for their reviewing services. I also know that the company (Day by Day Beauty, or the owner, Pamela) thumbs down all critical/negative reviews of this product, which speaks for itself. I know they are a small company and all, but poo-pooing other people's criticism will not make your product sell better.....I have been using this serum for a few weeks now, and while in some respect, I can feel my face absorbing my moisturizer better, I think it is too harsh on my skin. My skin has felt rougher the past few weeks, and I've had more acne outbreaks than usual. While acne and sensitive skin is a problem for me overall, it got noticeably worse after and while using this product. I had pretty smooth and blemish-free skin before using this product.The main product claims for this serum are that it minimizes wrinkles and fine lines AND helps with uneven skin tone. Overall it seems like this product would increase skin elasticity and give a ""luminous glow"" but none of these happened to me. I am not at that stage where I need to worry about wrinkles yet (I'm in the 18-24 age range), but the main reason I wanted to try this product was to even out my skin tone, for instance, for the sun damage and acne scarring. Sadly, this didn't happen either, and it in fact exacerbated my acne.The serum itself is hardly a serum; its consistency is more like that of a toner. It looks like water, though maybe a little less clear (it has a translucent shade, like starchy water) but is just as runny as water. It does not have a particular fragrance (which is good, because I'd rather it be all-natural than have added fragrances), but it does have an almost-medicinal smell to it. It is not noticeable when applied, however, as it absorbs very quickly.It isn't greasy at all but after putting it all over my face, my face does feel a little sticky and tacky, rather than soft and smooth. That's why I definitely recommend using a moisturizer over this; the product itself does not really moisturize (even though it claims to have moisturizing ingredients).What I did love is the packaging. Rather than the dropper bottle that other serums use, this uses an easy, sanitary pump bottle. I like this because you don't risk contaminating the entire bottle every time you open it, and also because it's spill-proof (for when you're traveling).I don't think I would purchase this serum on my own. I will not be using it again after I finish my bottle, just because I don't think it benefitted my skin at all.FTC Disclosure: I received one free sample bottle of this serum in order to write an honest and unbiased review. I was not paid or sponsored to write this review--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts and opinions are mine and mine alone.",2
"I am a 55 year old olive skinned Caucasian.  I have thin, dry, slightly discolored, sensitive skin.  I use this product to lighten the discolorations and to try to soften the wrinkles on my face.  I also have dark circles under my eyes and had hoped that the peel would help.  I cannot leave it on for more than a few minutes because it begins to sting. It has helped my little age spots/freckles, but it has taken several uses.  I usually do the peel every 10 to 14 days. (sometimes only once a month). I think that the change (for me) has been slow and gradual although my skin feels incredibly soft post peel.  I have received compliments lately and I truly believe it is because of this peel. Naturally, I had hoped in a miracle.  I had hoped that my face would be all one color and the under eye circles would magically go away.  The little age spots that sit in the deepest part of my eye circles are still there but becoming lighter. This peel will be something that I will use as long as I can.On another note: a girlfriend of mine used the peel and felt absolutely nothing... not even a tingle.  So, you see, it really does depend on the sensitivity of your skin as to whether it will burn or not.",5
"This concealer works really well to cover age spots, red spots, blotches, etc. on my face, neck and chest area.",5
"Ashieda Beauty Nectar contains the various amino acids that are an important part of the structure of the skin, nails, bones, and connective tissues, along with other helpful ingredients such as vitamin C, phytoceramides, and resveratrol.  The amino acid peptides are in a form that is readily absorbed and utilized by the body, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, also know as gelatin.Each safety-sealed glass bottle contains 2 oz. of nectar with the delicious flavor of sweet, lemony apple juice.  I keep the bottles in the refrigerator and the cold nectar is very refreshing and I like knowing that I am giving my body the nutrients that it needs to be (and look) healthy.Ashieda provided a sample for evaluation and review.",5

"The eyelash curler I have been using before trying this one by Tweezerman was by Revlon.  I really like this Tweezerman curler, it is well made and sturdy, not rickety or loose at all.  I like the silicone pad that is replaceable so that your lashes don't get damaged.  I have been using this every day and would buy it again.  I really like it and it works well.  It also comes with 3 replacement silicone pads.",5
I've tried several heat protectants and still noticed continuous damage to my hair. This was the first product that I began noticing less and less damage and was able to space out my hair cuts/trims since I started using it. I'll spritz it on before any heat treatment and feel like it really is making a difference.,5
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Who knew that a simple brush would be so multifaceted?  Not only can you use it as a brush and a paddle, but, it easily converts to a shank and place to hide your stash!  Shank?  Stash?  Yeah, you read that right.  The sample that showed up at my place had a removable handle (see my Google+ page for video), which makes these extras possible.  Somehow, i don't think that was BellaSha's intent, but is a good indicator of their level of quality control.  If it weren't for the messed up manufacturing, the brush would be pretty decent.  Priced at eleven and a half (currently), it's on par with similar available in retain.  It's not some nice heft to it, and the plastic doesn't feel thin.  Perfect of detangling or a firm swat on the backside.",2
"buy a mirror, thinking that it illuminated. But it is my fault in English. Loved it increases! For correction of eyebrows super thing. Makeup is also perfect, we see all the pores of the face and even the hairs on the face) also make up this mirror to be perfect!",5
"This mask feels great going on.  It gently, but quickly, warms up just by putting it on your skin.  My face feels nice and clean afterwards, but I can't say with any amount of certainty that it has cleared up any blackheads or reduced the size of my pores - something I can't claim about any other masks on the market that I've tried either.  I would rather spend half the amount of money on a large bottle of another type of mask that gives me more than just 4 uses out of the package.",3
"Unfortunately, Cover Girl isn't making Natureluxe Gloss Balm anymore, so I had to order a few of these before I'm unable to purchase it.  I love the pale pink color and the moisturizing but light feel of it.",5
"I like this pallette, especially under my eyes to cover dark circles.  It covers very well and does not cake.",5
I was concerned about all the reviews about fake knockoffs.. Luckily I received the proper cologne and it smells great and lasts almost all day :).. It's a hint of spicy and fruity so i'd say it's appropriate for all times of the day or occasions .. :) Also not too common so people won't already know it alot of times.,5
"While many so-called moisturizing cr&egrave;mes (at a much higher price) promise to plump skin and diminish wrinkles, Hyaluraonic Acid Day Cr&egrave;me does just that. This is the solution that is put on the skin before facials in a salon, usually followed by some form of penetration enhancement. From the moment this cr&egrave;me goes on the skin feels `different' - fresh, non-saggy, plumped up. The cr&egrave;me lasts all day long without the need for re-application.The other in gredients in this cr&egrave;me are Water (Aqua), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth 20, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid; Actimoist Bio-2), Calcium Ascorbate (Ester-C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Polysorbate, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl. The company is pretty straight forward in telling you what exactly you're getting.  And with daily uses it works to freshen aging skin. Very fine product. Grady Harp, July 13",5
"I'm not big on manicures, but I enjoy a pedicure and polish on my toes when I don my summer sandals.  And as a cancer survivor, I love the idea of a nail polish without harmful chemicals and toxins, so I decided to give Acquarella a try.  I purchased a bottle of clear conditioner, a bottle of Tickle Me pink and a bottle of remover, which was quite an expensive investment - I could have bought several colors of regular polish for what I spent to prepare my nails for one color of Acquarella.  I buffed and cleaned my nails as instructed on the packaging, applied a base coat and then applied a coat of Tickle Me.  The color in the bottle is a horrid Barbie Doll pink; on the nails, it is kind of a watery see through pink.  I applied a second coat.  It still looked watery and streaky.  I've had it on for several days and it is holding up fine.  No chipping or peeling.  But the color and streaky looking coverage just isn't very pleasing to me.  I guess you don't know how these things will turn out if you don't try them, but my personal opinion is that this was a waste of my money.  I'll go back to regular polish and pass this along to my niece for her four year old daughter.Revised Opinion:  I later purchased another bottle of Aquarella polish in the color Aristo, which is a dark reddish pink color.  I am very pleased with this shade.  While I wouldn't recommend the color Tickle Me Pink, I give a thumbs up to the color Aristo.  I took this with me when I had a professional pedicure and had the nail technician apply it and I like it a lot.  I'd change the number of stars on my review from 3 to 5 if I could.",3
"My daughter adores this product 100%!! For the combined price of both for the conditioner and the shampoo, I will definitely re-order!",5
"I love this blush, it is simiple, and the colors are great, true to color, blends well, goes on well, stays on all day, not cakey, smooth, just like a great powder, great price, last for a long time, can mix it up with another shade if wanted, small so can carry with you if wanted, had no trouble receiving, came quickly, packaged well. cant say enough good things about this! so highly recommend!",5
"I have used this product before and this one was fine, but not as good as the past few time.  I think this might be a knock off version I got.",1
I haven't used it yet as I got it for when I do need it. I love this brand of polish!,4
"I have given my review on the pure Argan oil products that I order from Amazon on a regular basis.  I was first introduced to this particular product by my hairdresser.  I used to purchase it from her then I decided to compare prices on Amazon.  Yeah, I several dollars and as a prime member I get free shipping.  The Agadir Argan Oil Spray treatment is a staple in my hair product collection.  Frizzy hair is no longer an issue for me when it's rainy or humid outside.  It gives a beautiful shine to my hair without weighing it down.  Don't be heavy handed with this product because a little goes a long way.  I also use it after I shampoo and condition my hair as a heat protectant before I blow dry.  I definitely decreases drying time  Give this product a try and I hope you love it as much as I do.  It's far superior to &#34;the One&#34; Argan oil spray treatment.",5
"This scent is really lovely.  It has lovely floral notes and delicate vanilla and maybe jasmine?  Anyway, if you are looking for a nice, sweet, light scent that is delicate and not overpowering; you will love this.  The biggest problem?  It doesn't really stay on; but that being said, you can pop it into your purse and just spritz yourself whenever you need to!  I give this one a thumbs up!",5
"Love this top coat. I think it's the best top coast opi makes!  Combined with the opi natural base coat your manicure will last a week, and that's on natural nails!",5
I used this as a follow up comb through after I took down my twists to flat iron.  I did the chase method with the flat iron and this was the first time I was able to get my ends straight!,5
"This shampoo smells good, lathers nicely, and rinses well with no residue, BUT it left my hair feeling like straw and almost crunchy. This was immediately after rinsing it out of my hair, before applying conditioner. My hair felt so raw and rough. I did not like it at all. Heaps of conditioner were needed for it to feel smooth again. It was still hard to detangle even after the conditioner and I always comb my hair while in the shower with conditioner in it too. It may work well for someone out there, but definitely not me.",2
So excited to get this in the mail along with my fake nails to try some nail art. There was a lot of variety which I liked but some pieces came out of the ox and one set wasn't taped so it may have been used [previously. Over-all very satisfied. It only got three stars because on the box it said it comes with applicator and nail polish which it doesn't but the supplier doesn't specify that so I AM OKAY WITH PURCHASE.,3
"Did nothing whatsoever for my complexion.  It cost enough and I expected to see some results, but saw nothing after over a month of regular use.",1
"Okay, I have to confess that I did not try this product, my wife did. Sorry, but I refuse to use something like this! Here are her impressions:  She said the fragrance is very nice - ""refreshing"" is how she put it.  The liquid is rich and luxurious - you only need a small amount and it works up a very nice lather. It makes her skin feel very smooth and it also makes it feel like it tightens up her skin.  She didn't use it on her face, only on the rest of her body. Since she doesn't have wrinkles she couldn't say anything about its wrinkle-removing abilities but she did say that this is obviously a quality product that she wouldn't hesitate to use. It makes her skin feel great after using it.",5
This product is cheap and sucks and not even worth $1. This was a waste of time and money. Lame.,1
"I have extremely fine, thin hair, and not a lot of it.  My hair stylist used to put the Paul Mitchell root lifter and thicken up on my hair, but this time she just used the Awapuhi styling treatment oil on my hair after my cut and color.  My hair looked incredibly healthy, but thin.  I bought this at the salon and sprayed it in my hair when I got home.  Though it makes my hair look a little trashy, like I spent the night somewhere else last night, it thickened my hair up somewhat.  As long as I keep running my fingers into the roots and messing it around it still lifts a little bit.  Not sure it is worth the money, though, for the slight difference.  My hair dresser said it can be used with my other Paul Mitchell products to thicken even more so I'll have to try that on my next wash.",3
"I got this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend after hearing him hint that he liked the scent after sampling it at the mall. I, personally, liked the scent as well... so I bought it! He was thrilled... and he thinks I paid the Macy's price ;) SCOREEE!!",5
"These razors aren't quite as strong as the other Hydro 5 where you just replace the blade head, but they come close. They're far from being anything like a Bic disposable. Good buy if the price is right.",4
"Lipstick is my favorite makeup item and I'm glad I tried this one.  The color is a nice pink that goes on smooth and ""pinks up"" my pale complexion.  It doesn't have a heavy feel like some lipsticks do, and defines my lips without feathering.  Covergirl Lip Perfection seems to stay on when some I've had are off by the time I'm out the door.This is a nice line of lip colors and the selection of colors is big enough that there should be something for everyone.  Many department store lipsticks don't stay on or else they fade and leave a faint stain of color that looks like day-old makeup that's still on.  I'm glad I found this and I think another order might go in soon!",5
"I'm prone to really dry skin which gets even more difficult to manage in the winter time. The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I've tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.The bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I'm hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.The instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn't what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn't washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.",4
"I have a lack of eyebrows from over-plucking and from being Irish lol. So i depend on this stuff, and I count on it to stain my actual skin rather than the hairs because there are few hairs. but this will stain the skin; put vaseline around the brow to control the stain or use a stencil.",5
"Se eu pudesse dar 10 estrelas eu daria. O produto chegou intacto, e o vendedor mandou dois saxes de amostra caso tivesse vazado.O cheiro &eacute; maravilhoso, deixa o cabelo com brilho,macio. maravilhoso pra fazer escova e chapinha. A chapinha desliza e o cabelo j&aacute; fica brilhando. No &eacute; gorduroso, e no deixa o cabelo pesado e com aspecto de sujo. Muito pelo contr&aacute;rio, deixa o cabelo uma seda e cheiroso. Super recomendo",5
"Recommended by the person who cuts my hair.  I used to think all shampoo and conditioner were pretty much the same.  Using this product has taught me otherwise.  My hair has always tended to be stiff, wirey and somewhat unmanageable.  This, product, while not making my hair look like liquid silk that you see in commercials, definitely improves the overall feel.",5
"I use shower gel as an alternative to bath soap. This gel has a unique look and works well. The silver look grabs your attention and, since it works well and smells good, it does its job, just as it should. If you want a bath gel that is out of the ordinary, this just might be it.",4
"I have fine hair, so many conditioners are too heavy for me. I've always liked using spray-type leave-in detanglers. This one seems to weigh my hair down more than my favorite sprays. Before giving up on it, I'm going to keep using less and less till I get it right and I'll limit it to the ends of my hair, away from my scalp. I really like the fragrance.",3
This cream is terrific and inexpensive.  I use it daily and then follow with a richer moisture cream.  This product makes my skin feel smooth and poreless.  Looks great.,4
"I bought 2 of these for my daughter and me, they looked so cute.  They came fairly quickly from Hong Kong.  The under part of the headband is made of the normal elastic hair band material  and the top part is made of these little gold clasps that all hook together.  They break apart very easily and are to hard to clamp back together.  Also if you have curly hair do not buy this, it gets tangled badly!  Overall cute and works fine with perfectly smooth straight hair, but after a couple uses it will break very cheaply made.",2
"I've used this 1-2 times daily for over a month or so with no noticeable change in my wrinkles, but I like that it doesn't irritate my skin as other moisturizers tend to do.",4
"I love using this on my face. Rose water is an excellent skin toner and smells delightful. It dries without a trace so works extremely well before serums and other creams or under makeup.Another use I've found was using it as a simple rinse after hair color. I'm at that age where I have to get my hair colored, or at least the roots, every few weeks. Otherwise everyone will see my silver streaks and know I am lying when I claim I don't remember the 80s. Anyway, color always makes my scalp itchy and irritated for a few days. Because of the anti-inflammatory properties of rose water I decided to give it a try after my last color. Voila! I am no longer walking around kicking my back leg up and scratching behind my ears like a cocker spaniel. It really relieved the itch and it also smells amazing -- and hair color doesn't always smell so great for a few days.NOTE: My first order of this arrived broken in the box (that box still smells amazing) so I contacted the seller who was very apologetic and got me a replacement so fast I couldn't believe it. Just thought it was a good sign that this company clearly stands behind their products and takes care of their customers.Sample provided for unbiased review.",5
"This arrived 30 days ahead of the allotted shipping period (it ships from Hong Kong). It was well packaged and the product is exactly as described and pictured. It is stunning and really dresses up your hair! *shrugs* What can I say? I'm a girl, I like sparkles! :) This looks awesome in my hair. Yank it up into a sloppy bun and then adorn with this, and voila, pretty do!I have dark hair so this stands out. I don't know how it would look on lighter hair colors, but I'm sure it would look just as sparkly! Love that it shipped so fast and arrived intact and as described! Not to mention, that's a wonderful price for a sturdy, metal & crystal, comb!",5
It does work pretty well. It did give my hair a bit of a shine and it conditions well. Read the directions  before use though. If you use too much you will make your hair oily. But if you use just a touch you'll get some nice results.,4
This was a surprise to get! The designs are wonderful and the plates are metal so they will last for a very long time! I am so happy that I purchased this for a gift!,5
"For the record, I have very oily skin, and after reading all the 5 star reviews I figured this product had to do SOMETHING for my skin.It did not; It honestly did nothing at all for/against my skin.If anything it did feel a little bit cleaner after use, but that is nothing to warrant another purchase.I used it until I finished the product and I still saw no difference, luckily it's pretty cheap though so no harm done.Perhaps it will work wonders for others, but it honestly did nothing for me.",3
"It took me 4 decades to figure out how to keep my hair from being dry and frizzy.  I have been using this conditioner, the gel and the shampoo for a year now and I will never switch again.  I get compliments on my curls every single day.  The only compliment I got before was &#34;Nice haircut&#34;.  Now everyone wants to know how I get these curls.  I finally stopped fighting my curly hair and let it do it's own thing with little help from me.  I finally know what it is like to have moisturized hair that is pleasing to the touch.  This product also gives a beautiful shine.  Love it love it love it!",5
I was disappointed in this and didn't feel like it did anything for my hair.It makes a mess out of your tub on top of it.,2
Wonderfully crafted and detailed.  This item looks much better in person then depicted with the photographs provided on the sales information page.,5
"Excelente producto, lo recomiendo 100% al igual que el vendedor, me llego sin problemas y en las condiciones que el vendedor lo indic&oacute;. Gracias",5
Everything in the package was as it is shown on the picture. It arrive in a timely manner and it was carefully packed. I can't wait to get more of this sets. Love it!!!,5
"I don't really see that it improves the look of my pores. I still use it just because I want to finish it, but it's nothing amazing.",2
I use it for all nails! I love it. It makes perfect square nails its not cheap. Its very sturdy,5
These were purchase as gifts and both men like the coolness and smell they are not too strong and very inexpensive,5
"When I first got this product and the cleansing one (green colored) I was super excited to try it. For the green colored one I thought the scrublet worked better, but for this one I would rather use my hands.I'm not experiencing the same results with my blackheads as other people have noticed, but it takes the dirty and oil out of my pores. I also don't see as much exfoliation as it claims it does.I give it 3 stars still for cleansing out my face,the cute scrublet, and the low price, but I've seen better exfoliators out there.",3
"Okay, perhaps I was wrong to assume, but I assumed that a product with a yellow label color, called Fresh Awake, would be lemon scented. I have some face wash that follows this design paradigm. I guess not. The scent is light, and vaguely manly, but there is nothing lemony about it. Which is too bad, because I like lemon scent.As for its performance as a moisturizing body wash, I think I can say that it does seem to moisturize me better than the Old Spice I had been using. It also stands up better on the shelf and is less likely to tip over, always annoying.The spout on it also allows for smaller very precise squirts, though the product does not suds up that much. This allows you to, I guess, take a small dab for your face, though you'll still need a normal amount for your body, it isn't extra efficient or anything like that just because it comes out in a smaller stream than other body washes.",4
This is a terrific concealer brush. I use it every day. It is just the right weight and stiffness. Great.,5
"I have very sensitive, pale skin that is prone to blotchiness and redness.  I wouldn't say I have rosacea, but it's definitely something similar.  I have been trying out the Mario Badescu line of products and came upon this one -- I must say that I absolutely love it.  I use it after I cleanse and tone my face at night in place of a moisturizer (it's quite rich) and in the morning, my face is so much more even and the redness has come down considerably since I've started using it.  I've used it nightly for about a week and it hasn't broken me out or caused any irritation, so I'm one happy girl!  I'd give this a try if your skin is similar to mine and needs to calm down a little!",4
"My oldest daughter bought these with her Christmas money from Amazon and was super excited to get them.  Unfortunately, they are worthless!  First, the plastic that comes on them to protect during shipping is extremely difficult to remove and very time consuming.  My younger daughter cut herself on the edge of the plates trying to help - the edges are super sharp.  After all the work to remove the plastic, she couldn't wait to use them - except they don't work.  The 'stamps' aren't deep enough into the plate to allow the polish to sink into the picture to be transferred - she only found a few images that actually worked.  She tried different polishes, different rubber stamper tools, and different 'scraping' techniques to get them to work and all failed.  These definately need to go back.  The 'as seen on tv' set she has all worked perfectly, she just wanted more plates to go with it.  Too bad they didn't work.",1
"I was expecting them to be cheap and fall apart when I tried to use or clean them, But they  have held up pretty well. Over all I am really pleased with them!",4
"Neutrogena Body Oil is an added extra....something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter. However, for me, it doesn't work as well in the shower as I expected it to.  I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  It works just OK during the shower.  I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  Maybe it's the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.I have sensitive skin &amp; therefore I'm really comfortable w/Neutrogena's light products.  I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...it's good!",3
"This product is the best thing it happened to my hair. Unfortunately, because of the price I can't always afford it.When I see a promotion lowering the prices, I am sure I'll be ordering it.",5
"Another purchase for another cream that's suppose to help with my age spots. Sigh. At least it wasn't pricey and is a good moisturizer. Not wasted, but not what I was hoping for. Sigh again.",2
"I love this thing!! I had a baby and my body isnt quite the same so i have been using this everyday and i have to wash the tub out later on that day because i can actually see the dead skin!!! So that tells me how great it works :) very happy with this product, my skin is so soft!",5
"I've always wanted to try a BB cream, and this arrived as an accidental ""free"" item through the Amazon Vine program, so I thought I'd try it. I'm 41 years old, white with very pale skin, somewhat splotchy from dry spots and aging, a couple of scars from surgery and injury, but a decent complexion even if I only use a concealer, tinted moisturizer and a little powder. I got this thinking it would replace my tinted moisturizer but it didn't. I admit, I'm baffled by this product, so I looked up the use of BB cream in some cosmetics videos, and tried it in several different ways:1. As makeup, i.e. replacing my tinted moisturizer -- It was luminous, so much so it was almost as shiny as the special makeup products I buy to deliberately create shine (like Watts Up!, etc.). But it didn't give me enough coverage, and was so thick that the powder clumped when I dusted my face. It also was thick enough to remove the concealer I had put on before using the BB cream (as recommended by a couple of how-to videos I had watched). I used it before putting on concealer and foundation once and that was just a joke, it was so thick I felt like my face was going to crack.2. Tinted sunscreen -- This was the best use I found for it so far. I put it on before being outside a couple of hours instead of using any makeup, and it lasted just fine, even after sweating. Again, though, no coverage to speak of.3. Moisturizer -- It didn't moisturize enough to replace my current moisturizer. If I put it on after letting my Loreal Age Perfect moisturizer soak in a little, it worked well enough, but again it just didn't provide enough coverage for me to feel fully comfortable. The color of the light-medium shade does seem to adjust to your own skin tone, but to a lighter shade, especially when used with the Age Perfect moisturizer. Since I'm already quite pale, it made me look almost like I was trying for a Goth look.After using it on my face after my current moisturizer for a few days, I broke out, because it is kind of thick and on the oily parts of my face, it's a little too much. Basically, I'll toss this in the drawer with my other sunscreen, and use this for days when I need to be in the sun for yard work or home repairs, because it's decent enough coverage for an emergency run to the hardware store, not so much for going out to eat.",3
"This product has done nothing to improve my skin. I gave it 3 stars because it moisturizes well and I like the high SPF, but it does nothing else. It's not worth the money, I've had better results using cheaper products.",3
"As the instructions indicate, I've used this for one month as of May 20th before I wrote this review.  What I like is that this moisturizer is smooth, silky, and very moisturizing.  The small vials of ""biomineral concentrate"" dispense a very silky solution that feels great on the face.  However, combining the biomedical concentrate (first) and then the rejuvenating moisturizer (second) as stated on the package did not ""dramatically reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles"" on my face.  In fact, I noticed absolutely no difference after a month.In summary, I find this to be a great moisturizer but it did not live up to its claims as a wrinkle reducer.",3
I received this as a gift. I have used Wen products before and I love the way it makes my hair feel. Top of the line for half the cost,5
"I've had it with nonperforming products, hence the many one star reviews I'm about to give. Hopefully it will save someone from spending money on products that do not work...at all. I would give this product more than one star if it actually did something, but it doesn't.I'm turning 40 with fine lines starting to set. Laugh lines now appearing. :( there is no firming whatsoever with this product. It's a bit sticky, but once on the face, it absorbs and is not noticeable at all. I have sensitive skin and have not had a problem at all with breakouts. But, it did nothing. Used approx 5 months. Sorry Philosophy... Fail.",1
"Awesome product! I am biased because I love all the Alba products but their sunless tanner is the best I've ever used. I've tried products costing four times as much but this is the best. Alba moisturizes the skin with its thick lotion, and gives a lovely color that looks very real. I was ghost white until after I used Alba Sunless. I refuse to tan outdoors or in booths because I have had skin cancer. Alba allows you to build color gradually; just add another coat the next day until you are as dark as you like.Alba doesn't have an obnoxious odor, either, like the other products. You cannot smell it at all and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, even after shaving.For some reason, Alba does not work well on my face but that might be because I don't exfoliate it enough.",5
This stuff works so well with my kanachom deep conditioning mix. It keeps my hair moist for longer periods of time.  A must have in your hair regimen.,5
"I picked this up because my fine hair tends to have numerous fly aways on the top of my head and occasionally frizzes out on the sides in humid weather thanks to the natural waves in my hair. I use a straightener every day but still some of those pesky hairs just won't cooperate. I was excited to try this.. until I actually used it. It recommends 2-3 pumps of creme and I used 1, being it was my first time and I didn't want to overdo it. Not only did it do NOTHING for the frizz, it made my hair stiff and greasy. My hair that is normally soft and shiny is now a clump of gross, greasy straw. It has been a WEEK and I have washed my hair once or twice daily to get rid of it and my hair is STILL stiff and greasy. Maybe this is only intended for extremely curly or frizzy hair and it's not the right product for my hair type, but jeez, at least let me wash it out!! :( VERY frustrated and returning for a refund.",1
"My husband tested this product, not only because it's marketed for men, but because he prefers a spray-on sunscreen and has used several different brands.  He said that this spray is by far his favorite among all the others.  He keeps his hair very close cropped, so he uses it on his scalp, as well as his arms.  He does not use it on his face, preferring a lotion sunscreen for that area.  He says that this sunscreen sprays on easily, and more cleanly than some of the other sprays.  There is no unpleasant or greasy residue.  It's easy to spread with your hands if need be, although the spray covers pretty evenly.  He likes the scent and so do I, although I only notice it when he first applies the spray.",5
"i have long dreadlocks and if i need to hold some out of the way for maintenance or whatever these do the job!! they hold large amounts of locs out of the way securely without any stress, breakage or forcing. ill be getting more!!",5
"although I believe the Roc products I have used do what they claim, this particular Daily Moisturizer seems to me, just to be a sunscreen...and that's it. I do not see any other benefits and will not purchase again. Will maybe try the daily gravity cream instead.",2
"This is a very nice face cream. It applies smoothly and evenly. One can use just a small amount to have good facial coverage.All of these Olay products have been well designed and developed. They are rich creams, over all fairly hypo-allergenic, and do the job they promise at a good and affordable price. The list of Olay dermatologists, scientists and product developers is impressive.Been using Olay products for years and am very pleased.  This whole new Regenerist line is a far cry from the Oil of Olay line of yesterday. That was nice, and probably formulated for 20 something skin.  This new Regenerist product line is definitely beneficial to more mature skin and helps it to look lovely even in dry and polluted city climates.",4
"Mine came from Swanson and took almost 2 weeks to arrive. Brush seems ok, clear plastic handle on mine. Bristles feel tight in base. Made in China.",4
GREAT NUDE COLORS WITH NO SPARKLE.....LOVE LOVE LOVE!  TAKES AWHILE TO GET THREW THIS STUFF... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! IF YOU HAVE ;LOTS OF SPARKLE EYE SHADOWS GET THESE AS YOUR BASIC COLORS AS THE BASICS.,5
"I love this color! It looks like I have pieces of metal on my fingers (which I wanted when I bought this). But it chips, even when you use top clear coat. It's kind of thin, so you have to use more which causes chipping.",4
"Although it is a gift for my daughter for Christmas, I did a thorough inspection upon delivery and found it to be the PERFECT size and excellent quality - very sturdy and so cute! Excellent purchase and highly recommend.  I will update in a few months to see how it holds up to a 13 year old ;)",5
"I love making my own products. Soaps, shampoos, lotions, balms, cleaners and detergents for the home, this is a lovely addition. Wonderful toner. This lovely rose scent is affordable with the add on and prime. I put some in a tiny spray bottle to keep with me as a nice little facial refresher as needed or scent a personal space. Although, Scent of Samadhi and orange blossom water will stay my personal favorite scents, I'll keep this on my shelf and use it often.",5
"Pros: Cheap for the amount of wedges you get, work easily, very soft.Cons: They don't wash off easily, and if using for nail art, it takes off the bottom coat more often than not.",4
"Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner is a product that others in my household were more excited to try than myself.  It is just a conditioner, right?  Well, yes it is, but it is a good product indeed.The product's goal?  Provide quality moisturizing performance, while not adding significant residues to your hair.  The product succeeds.  Plus, when used with the matched shampoo, the hair care connoisseur in my home raved that the product team kept their hair light, while still keeping it soft.  It treated the hair without adding weight to it.  One supposes, it performs as its name suggests.The fragrance is also ""light,"" and subtle.  Truthfully, while I did not want to believe it, I would say the product did deliver as marketed.  Best of all, it's a premium hair salon quality product, but at a reasonable price.  Who does not love that?  The product surprised me.  Recommended.  Thanks Nexxus!",4
"I bought this on a whim, and it is very nice.  The brush that comes with is nice as well.  The second day I wore it, someone told me I looked like I was &#34;glowing&#34;.  It is very subtle, but does the job.",4
"this is so easy to use & is a must have. it comes with the batteries as well as the head. the head is easy to put on & change when needed. it works so easy this is better than doing it with a manual brush. works for both women & men. i also bought the following with this: Olay Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads  (have not had to change heads but i wanted to have some on hand), Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash 6.5 Fl Oz,Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser Skin Care 5 Fl Oz. both are great for detoxifying pores & the cream cleanser skin care is great for getting rid of fine lines & wrinkles.",5
sponge styling hair clip.  easy to use. convenoent. small enough to pupt in your purse or pocket.  bun never easy tod do,5
"The creamy white bottle is fitting for a shampoo that calls itself ""hair milk,"" and the creamy white texture of the liquid inside fits, too. The graphic design on the bottle might make you wonder if it's a product for kids, but nevertheless it does the job whatever your age. (But who is the ""me"" on the label, from a marketing perspective? Dunno -- maybe just me!)At any rate, I found the texture to be nice, much like other shampoos I've used. And I liked the smell. It almost seemed coconut-y. The shampoo left my long hair easy to comb, and that's the bigger plus for me. I also appreciate the healthy ingredients like biotin, honey, vitamin E and C, and shea butter.",4
"I like this brush,it seems to be a dupe of the brushes REAL TECHNIQUES.and thats what i like about it. also when i got mine it was shedding but thts with most brushes because the chemicals in the process of making it are still on there,but after i washed it,it was fine i like how they come in different colors like, pink,purple,blue. oppose to the real techniques only come in two basic boring colors. It is soo soft and i like tht its softer then the real techniques brushes but the docooler is not as firm as id like them then real techniques but is sturdy enough and has its own unique qualities.Something i would love to see if docooler decides to make a new collection is the name on the brush.But overall i am pleased with docoolers brush and will be buying from them again soon!You make wonderful products.-Customerforlife :)",4
"First let me say that I have fine, dry hair, which is especially hard to handle. I'm forever looking for products that will moisturize it without weighing it down. Unfortunately, this product is just too oily for my hair, and made it feel greasy and look stringy. I only used it a few times, in vary amounts, but I couldn't make it work. A total waste :(",1
"I just did my first application in dark brown to cover my 1"" roots.  I have light brown shimmering high lights and red brown coloring job on therefore i was not sure if the dark brown would blend in well with the lighter shades.  During the waiting time, i noticed how dark it was and my worry was not lassened.  However, as soon as i finished blowing drying, i can't tell the cover-up.  i was really impressed how well it blended with the existing lighter color.  the amount is just perfect for roots, not for the whole hair unless u have very short cropped do.next time i'll get the reddish brown just to see if it works.very happy with this product!",5
"I live in a climate that is mostly warm to too hot and so I keep my hair up a most of the time. I'm disappointed, since I thought these were much larger given that first of all the listing says ""Product Dimensions: 6.5 x 2.8 x 2"" inches and I would take that to mean that the clip itself, being the product, is that size, not the dimensions of the card the clips are clipped to, with the 2"" being the height the of the clip. The ones I received are 2.5(l)"" x 2""(w) x 2""(h), which is pretty small. The second reason I thought the product dimensions would be the size of the actual product is that someone said on their review that the clip was too big for their long hair. My hair is pretty long and the last octopus clip I had was about 4"" and worked beautifully to keep my hair up in a bun with minimal pulling on the hair it is fastened to and so I thought these were like that clip, given the information I was supplied.That said,which isn't the fault of the clips themselves, they are well made and have some rubber type material inside to help it to stay in place, which the package calls ""No Slip Grip"" and ""all day hold"". While I can't put all my hair in these clips, it does work to put it on the circumference, in other words, if I twist my hair and clip it, much like a pony tail it works great and stays in place. So while I am disappointed they weren't the size I expected, this clip itself is well made.",5
"This color is a bright, hot pink (think Nars Schiap) and dries down to a matte finish. I wasn't sure what to expect with the name-'tar' made me think of sticky gunk like gloss but not at all. It goes on like a gloss and then dries down to a matte/satin finish without ANY stickiness. A  few notes-you NEED a brush-this is NOT for finger application. Also, consider a set because you can mix colors and make the perfect shade for you. Also I would mix it on the back of your hand (although you might have a stain there!) or a palette because you really cannot mix them on your lips-they set too fast to blend well. A little goes a looong way, this is highly pigmented stuff. Don't let me name fool you-it is the least drying and most lasting lip product I have used.",5
I just started using these e.l.f. cleansing cloths in lieu of another brand I still had on hand.  Much prefer these.  The cloth is soft and strong.  Takes off all the eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling very nice.  I would purchase again.,4
"Fights acne and age spots, also i notice that my skin tone is very even and the hand i apply the serum with looks more &#34;youthful&#34; than the other. I will have to switch palms up when applying to get an even affect ;)",5

"I love the original Suave Dry Shampoo (grey and yellow bottle), so I thought this one would be awesome because it has keratin in it too! Um....no! This one is awful! Smells horrible! When I was thinking about buying this, I bought it without smelling it at the store. I did read some reviews here on a amazon. One person said this smelled like a chemical bomb went off. I thought they were just exaggerating, but no! That is actually how this smells! And the scent will stay in your hair ALL DAY! I became super self conscious while wearing this! In addition to reeking, this product just did not perform as well as other dry shampoos. My hair looked just as oily after using it as it did before (and I did apply it correctly.) So I do recommend the original Suave Dry Shampoo, but never ever this one!",1
"This stand comes in 3 pieces & can be slightly confusing to put together the first time. After I had it together, I wondered why I found it so puzzling. The stand allows your wig to air between wearings or air dry after washing & can be taken apart to pack for traveling. It's not designed to be used as a styling base, but with a little patience, it might work. My stand is sturdy & doesn't wobble. Tony of Beverly's, Andie, is resting on it right now.Assembly instructions:~Slip the oval piece - which has the slit/groove on the bottom of the section, through the oval piece - which has the slit/groove on top of the section. Press together.~Align top ovals together & slip notch into the slit/groove then press down.~Put the circular piece on top of the two oval sections matching the notches on the circular piece with the slits on top of the ovals & press down.",4

"This are the smaller bottles, but they work fine for those just starting to do their own gel nails.  Later, I started buying the full sizes separately.",4
This Tanning lotion seems to do much better than others I have used. It seem to tan more evenly and feels good on my skin.,4
"I had originally bought this product for my daughter, who has thick curly hair. As soon as I applied it to her hair, I noticed her curls instantly became moisturized and less frizzy. I'm a fan of the smell too.Side Note: I'm not sure why Amazon has a price listed as $21.99. I bought it at Target for $9.99.",5
Bought as a  Christmas gift.  Wish I had bought 2 more the are cute unique headbands.  I gave it to my sons girlfriend she loved it so did my 2 girls. Vintage look. I will buy again,5
If you don't already have the Naked palette invest in this! I love it but don't use as often as I should because I love my Naked Palette. The colors are neutral and amazing! When I do use it I'm reminded how great it is.,5
"Yes, it is a matte topcoat.  And I like it a lot for nude fingers!Please note it comes in a half-size bottle, which is not what I was expecting.  But I will buy again.",5
"We tried this product with my son.I've used waterless shampoos before - with my straight, fine hair, they can extend a day between washing at most, absorbing oils and sometimes leaving hair actually crackly and dry. The good news with this is that it didn't render my son's hair (similar in texture to mine) crackly and dry, but it did leave a residue...and it didn't noticeably make the hair look any cleaner (although it smelled nice, if you like Axe's products). There are less expensive dry shampoos out there, although probably none that smell quite this good.",3
I bought these for my daughters collection! Very nice! They arrived in perfect condition! Thank you sooo much! Happy New YEAR!!!,5

"I tried this product because it has a lot of things I like and routinely use in it: shea, argan, almond oil, and I am always looking for natural, plant-based products.  It might well make your hair shiny, because it doesn't come out (I have washed my hair twice now... and am off for a third round :(I was a bit skeptical when I put it on, as it has the consistency of wax mixed with petroleum oil.  Thick, so thick it is difficult to apply evenly (or in a thin layer).  It does smell nice, I will give it that, so- there's the 1 star (I could not give it a zero).I used this after I washed my hair last night and it felt greasy, so I washed it again.  It didn't come out.  I washed it again, and went to sleep.  In just a few minutes, I will be washing it again :(  :( and hoping that I can get it out this time, and that it did not ruin the sheets.Consider this review not so much a recommendation as a warning.______________________________________________________________________update: I have now washed my hair 4 times and have not been able to get it all out :( It feels greasy, damp & heavy,  and is getting all over my clothing , sheets.  I would say that this is singularly one of the worst products I have ever used.  I would not even recommend a trial, unless you are willing to live with it.Because of all the nourishing oils, and the consistency, it might make a nice furniture or (wood) floor polish, but unless you like the greaser look, I would not put it on your hair (and am hoping a third wash will get it out of mine).It even made my dog mad! He usually gets walked before I get in the shower, but today he just has to wait.___________________________________________________________________________some hours later... after 6 shampoos (twice by my hair dresser, I came home & tried her recommendation:  Liquid Joy.  Two rises with dish soap got most of it out.  This is being posted for those who tried it and feel like the only way to get it off is to shave their heads (my stylist actually suggested that- laughing :P  If you have not tried it... think seriously about what you are getting yourself into.I read some of the other reviews and it seems maybe it's good for some people with different hair, different issues.  I wish the manufacturer were honest and said that!  I liked my hair before I used this stuff.  Now... I just hope I can get the last of it out.",1
"Lately I have been suffering from dry scalp and have purchased several expensive shampoos, including some prescribed by my dermatologist, to remedy it. While I would not dare compare this product to some of those, I did find that this one was an inexpensive alternative. What I liked about this product.....while I have found that some of the other ""dry scalp"" products leave your hair feeling a bit dry, leaving you with the need to lock in moisture, this one did leave your hair feeling soft. This product was also moisturizing, with a pleasant smell. Although when you are lathering with it, it smells tropically...like coconuts with a hint of almond, once rinsed, I really didn't notice a strong lingering odor.  This shampoo moisturizes your hair while nourishing it, leaving your hair feeling clean and healthy. The packaging is attractive and fits nicely in a corner of the shower (or bath). The bottle has a tall with a simple, slender design.  And finally, it is affordable. Overall, I give this product a 4.",4
This red is comparable to Axxium's candy apple color. It's got a dark pink tint to it. Hope this helps :),5
what can I say! the Japanese know what they are doing. This amazing product exfoliates immediately. you put it on your face and upon making circular motions you are already collecting dead skin cells. wow! nothing like it really!,5
"This is an excellent conditioner that really hydrates my dry, coarse hair. My hair soaks it up like a sponge. It really has a great de-tangling effect on my hair, and that's a rare thing with conditioners and my hair (which is very long to my waist). The fragrance is clean and fresh, not too heavy or &#34;flowery&#34;, could easily be used by men as well. I plan on getting the deep conditioner to go with this Nourish product for winter weather since it has been so dry this year. If you want soft, shiny, lustrous hair, this is the conditioner...I think you'll love it. TiGi makes super great professional products (I've used them when visiting my hair salon) and this one's no exception. Nourish really deserves 5 stars.",5
"Lots of hot air, and thats a good thing.Compared to the old Wahl hairdryer this one has a lot more power, albeit only with two settings (low/high).  However it does have three heat settings, a 'cool' button, and a switch to turn the ionic part of it on/off.It is big, but it's not unbearable, overall it's a decent mid-range hairdryer.",5
"I just started using this prouduct after reading so many good reviews, so far, my scalp tingles when I applied it and the smell is no as bad as I thought from reading other reivews. I will be back to give a second review after 30 days of using it.",4
"This item was perfect. Instead of using my nails, I used this, and I took out my blackheads without hurting my skin.",5
"Having used Cetaphil products for many years following a recommendation by my dermatologist, I was happy to see the introduction of the Dermacontrol product line. The idea is to gently clean, protect and moisturize without drying out sensitive skin.Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer is recommended for use at the beginning of the day. I've found that it works really well as a daily moisturizer and sunscreen. I apply a small amount in the morning after washing. It seems to really lock in moisture and protect against harmful sun damage - with minimal aggravation to oily spots, which I have found can be a big problem with other moisturizers.At the end of the day, I useCetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, 8 Fluid Ounceto clean up. The foam wash offers a very gently clean that allows your skin to replenish overnight, again without drying out.  It's been about a week since I started this daily regimen and it seems to be working very well for me.Whether you choose to use these two products in tandem or alone, I highly recommend Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer and Foam Wash to everyone - especially to those who struggle with oily yet sensitive skin.",5
"I have had several bottles of Obsession over the years, in fact still have a half-full bottle on my dressing table. I love sweet, spicy scents like Shalimar, so it's hard to scare me with sweet heavy fragrances that are so ideal for cooler weather. However, I never took to Euphoria. Something about it was just wrong for me. At any rate I've been longing for a new fragrance for fall and had my heart set on a bottle of Cassini EDP, but it is proving difficult to find. Swinging by TJ Maxx today to check and see if by chance they had some, I saw the Obsession Night. Something told me: ""Just get it."" And I did, and honestly, I am head over heels in love with this perfume. At first sniff it reminded me a great deal of Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle, another undeniably fabulous scent. But Obsession Night is wonderful in its own right. I can tell I am going to really enjoy wearing this. I'm delighted.",5
"it works ok and that's really all i can say, i just wasn't impressed. i already have straight hair and i thought this would help eliminate using a straightener, i just like having that shine and sleeker look, well it didn't really do anything a regular blow dryer wouldn't do. i don't recommend you waste your money.",2
"This is a must buy! Its an amazing color! When shipped it had extra protection, I completly LOVE it. I know that my lip liner wouldnt get broken. Will buy from this seller again!",5
"I've used many physical sunblocks and they all leave a pasty white residue even if it says non-whitening or goes on clear. I finally gave in and bought BurnOut because I was desperate for something that wouldn't make me look like I had dried toothpaste smeared on my face and neck and it got great reviews.  With the other sunscreens I always had to keep applying more product because it just didn't seem to spread well.  But BurnOut feels more like a lotion so it spreads much better and I don't need to apply as much.  Also, no white residue!  I loooove this stuff! It's still tacky like the others but that's just what I have to live with if I want to slow down the aging process. It's about twice as expensive as other stuff I buy but I am buying BurnOut from now on.  I hope they don't stop making it!",5
"Bought this for my daughter and was very surprised just how nice this looks alone or with a top coat when we used a red polish and completed the look with the sheer tint her nails had a beautiful shine also made the red more vibrant .,when we painted over a Pink polish it looked lavender so pretty and even alone its different and looks great.Goes on easy no clumping or streaks its a wide Brush so thats also a plus OPI seems to always come up with something different and these tints are advertised in many magazines i have .",4

"I don't usually even read five-star reviews. I rarely give five star reviews. Five stars means perfect. People are way too easy in giving five stars in my opinion. So for me to get five stars it means I think very highly of this product. And I do. This company in my opinion makes the best shampoos and conditioners which are also natural for your hair. I care about my health and I don't put cancer-causing chemicals on her in my body. This leave-in conditioner is truly amazing insofar that it does not leave your hair heavy, and, I had very dry damaged longhair, even though I am a man, and it almost immediately started to help my hair become healthier better feeling and better looking. Now after using it for a couple of weeks my hair is definitively better and I expect it to continue to get even more better. The only negative I can think of is that it is a bit pricey and it would be nice if these holistic oriented companies would stop gouging the public of which I believe they use the excuse of holistic to over-charge for their products; have you shopped at whole foods lately? You could drop $500 in that store without even trying. It's ridiculous in my opinion.",5
"All the hype about these products!! I got little samples from my birthday from sephora, and used em all up pretty fast.  They are, however, a little bit waxy.  But I like the colors and smells, especially the coral one, which I really like.  REMEMBER: the packaging is metal, and I left it in my pocket all day, melting the product and it was a tragedy...  So beware, in the hot summers don't leave them in your car, and don't carry them in your pocket.  They are too expensive to let go to waste, I'm much more careful with my coral one, since I paid for a full size.",3
"It has been forever since I have tried a nose strip. I was expecting a forest of pore residents to be standing on the pad when I tore it off, but I guess I must keep my face cleaner now; several pores made benefit of the deep-cleaning of the pad, nonetheless. It is refreshing putting one of these to use.The process is easy; all it takes is me washing my face [and nose], leaving my nose wet, peeling off the patch backing, applying  the patch and pressing firmly with dry hands and then waiting fifteen minutes or so. Once the strip dries to the form of my nose, I slowly lift up on the edges and voil&agrave; - clean pores!Not to be gross or anything, but this is much easier, and likely better for the complexion, than scrunching and squeezing. I do not want capillaries showing when I get older. Bior&eacute; strips are bomb!",5
Nice for the price this clip is lighter weight then some of the others I have bought but stays in your Hair better I think it  is prettier then in the pictures lots of complements wish I had bought more I have 4 daughters they all love it great for valentines day.,5
"Using shampoo or soap to clease brushes and makeup sponges leaved residue and marks of product in them, especially foundation. This one cleanses immaculately! Highly recommended.",5
"great, I dont have to smell that stuff so much when I use these for nail acrylic supplies. I think it can be used for other things if your creative enough.",5
"I was immediately interested when I saw this product. Who wouldn't be interested in healthy hair? This is a good value. Put down the salon pricey products and get this. Everyone will wonder why you look "" fresher"". Left my hair in control, yet feeling light.. not heavy.. .friz was controlled. The packaging is nice, the smell is not overwhelming... its nice. My next vacation another tube of this is going with me. Try it... I bet you like it!",5
I decided to jump on this brush because of the price of it and mainly because I needed a new round brush. This is a pretty good size brush and seems like its of good quality too. Which is great since my 12.00 Vidal Sassoon round brush practically melted with the heat from the blow dryer. =),5
"This is the third time I purchase this brand of HA, I have used it with my micro-current device around my neck, eyes, cheeks and face, it doesn't burn my skin, it absorbs very quickly and give me the hydration I need. I use it twice a day on clean face.",4
"This will definately make you hair stay put any way you want to stick it.A small amount in palm about nickle size and rub hands together and then distribute all through or over hair you want to style. Comb or hand style.It sticks and drys to a hard shellac hold. Great to use to achieve the spiked look, but my sons did not like the hard feel.",4
Arrived quickly.  Smells horrible but I use as directed.  Put on overnight or hours before shampooing and have new hair growth in the one month since I started using along with Amla capsules.  Very pleased.,5
Horrible cheap plastic eyelashes... My friend laugh about me when I wear it at home just to see how it looks like...,1
"I will update my review after using this a bit more, but after a few tries, i am not convinced that this is going to replace normal shampoo and conditioner for me. i may use this and mix it up every other time or something. I am finding that my hair still feels a bit greasy and dirty after showering and using this product. i have rinsed extra well and not left any in as a leave in and i still feel my hair is a bit dull, heavy and weighed down and not ultra clean.  I do understand that this is a lot better for my hair and will help the color last longer, so i am going to continue to try it out.  The smell is nice and clean and fresh, i am not getting any tingle from the product as i thought i was going to on my scalp.  it feels as if it rinses out well, and i do not have the tangles that i would normally have if i were to skip conditioner after shampooing. I will update in a few weeks when i have used it more.",3
this glue works really well!!! so well that I have glued my finger to something several times lol it also came very quickly!,5
Pleased customer. The brushes are made of a fine brush all the way to a thicker brush with many variations in between. I use them for nail art and many other craft type projects.,5
"I am disappointed in Cocktail Bling--I thought it would be more of a light, concrete gray, but it leans very purple/lavender. It is pretty and goes on smoothly and dries quickly, but it's not what I was looking for. I have Bobbing for Baubles and think that is the best shade of this collection--it is a deep, rich navy that looks beautiful on. The hunt for the perfect gray continues...",3
"~These eye make-up remover pads worked well; they removed my eye make-up and did not dry out my skin.  I wish they were a little bigger and a little thicker.  At 2.5"" x 2.5"" I usually had to use two on each eye because they didn't hold there shape and they folded while wiping.",3
"The air compressor came scratched up. I wonder if the item was used, returned and restocked. Even on high, not much came of of the air brush. When it did come out it was huge splatter, not a fine mist. It did not cover my skin no matter how much color mixing or primer I used. After application my face felt sticky. This did not cover anything on my face. I returned mine. Save your time and money and skip this.",1
It was an okay cream. Very creamy. You have to remix it because  the oils separated. I've bought better homemade calendula creams on etsy.,3
"I found a trial sized shampoo and conditioner at a whole foods store, and I absolutely hated it. I have fine straight hair and it just made my hair feel sort of greasy but at the same time dry and frizzy. So far the best I've used is either Pureology (which is really expensive) or Dove (cheap but good).",1
"Well...I ordered this to augment my face-washing regimen since the other one was not working the way I expected it.  Well, I don't find that it works.  You have to use a great deal to get the warming effect, which is very sticky.  You have to use a great deal of water to get the warming effect, which dries quickly and becomes very sticky.  You can't use too much water at one time otherwise it will wash it off your face.  But even so, it's still hard to get off your face.  I tried doing it with just my fingers, with the Pro-X brush and the Pro-X exfoliating head.  It worked best with the brush to create the warming sensation.  Even so, I have noticed zero difference in my face and am getting broken out again.  I'm probably going to ask for my money back, which Olay will do if you request it.",2
"So, I have been using this for about a few months now. I know that products like these usually take a while to work (when they really should work within the first few uses) so I decided to wait before waiting to post a review. So I use this every day as an under eye concealer. I have really dark circles, and I used to use foundation to cover them up. I decided to go with an dark circle serum and after reading reviews, I decided to get this. Though it covers dark circles, sweating a little or even wearing it for a while makes your dark circles visible again. I still use it to get a little coverage, but it isn't entirely worth buying. Still looking for a dark circle serum that actually works.",3
I had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick. It gave me a terrible headache and my sinus's swelled and I couldn't breathe. I had to return them.WARNING TO ALLERGY SUFFERS AND THOSE WITH SINUS ISSUES **********************The smell is so strong. Buyer beware!!!,1
I am 49 years old and color treat my hair every 2-3 months; mostly low lights and very few highlights. I have oily hair but summer and color processing left my hair stiff and with a great deal of breakage. I purchased this shampoo and the Monoi Repairing Condition hoping to restore shine and improve the condition of my hair.After almost three months of use it has not improved the dullness of my hair and I continue to have breakage even after minimizing the use of my flat iron. It has helped a little with improving the elasticity of my hair. The only other product I have used on my hair after washing is a thermal protectant. I feel the shampoo and conditioner actually weigh my hair down too much. I feel the need to wash every day which only makes the scalp produce more oil.This product combination did not work well for me but may work better on normal/dry hair. I will use what is left but will not be purchasing replacement product. The scent is pleasant and it does a decent job of leaving wet hair manageable enough to comb out without too much pulling.,3
"so far this is my favorite blush you can wear it everyday light or evening darker i have all Nars, Elf blushes great like knockoff colors texture and color payoff.",5
"Pro's-You're getting a lot of product here. Used on my face and neck only, this tub could easily last me well over 6 months-Pleasant smell. Not too cloying or perfumey-Mild and non-irritating. Keep in mind that I don't have super-sensitive skin, though. Your results may vary-Absorbs into skin rather quicklyCon's-No plastic tab between product and lid, which makes it a bit messy to use-Doesn't do anything special. My skin isn't glowing and I haven't noticed any dramatic improvements-Moisturizing properties are rather mild. If you have very dry skin it's probably not a good optionThis is good for people who want a lot of moisturizer for a cheap price. I bought this as an alternative to Oil of Olay, etc. and I think I'm going to pay a bit more for the good stuff and use this as a body moisturizer.",3
"This is a gentle, yet effective cleanser suitable for all skin types.  It does a good job of cleaning skin, but does not leave it feeling stripped.  It rinses easily.  The product is liquid.  The foaming is a result of the pump mechanism.  You may want to use more than one pump.  I do because I wash my face, neck, and decolletage.This product contains no sulfates, but does contain a masking fragrance.  The masking fragrance is the last ingredient listed, and does not adversely affect my skin.  I mention it for those who are very sensitive to fragrance.I could not smell the masking fragrance.  The product seemed unscented to me.  I would recommend this product for the entire family, except very young children and infants.No anti-acne ingredients will be left on the skin after rinsing; however, due to its ability to clean so gently and effectively, I do especially recommend it for acne sufferers",4
LOOOOOOVVVVEEEE. Really worth every penny.,5
"This is good stuff. I really like it and it's cheap, especially if you can get it from the local Wally World.I find that cream is better than any gel.This stuff is smooth & creamy, & smells good too.5 stars.",5
Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts is yet another great product put out by Adovia.  I really enjoyed trying this Facial Sea Salt scrub.  I have naturally dry skin which can be very frustrating.  My face never feels moist enough and I always feel like I have skin flaking off everywhere. As I have used this exfoliating facial sea salt I felt like my face has been softer than many other exfoliating products that I have tried in the past.  I ended up mixing this scrub with a little extra virgin olive oil because I prefer the extra virgin olive oil when using oil on my skin.  I don't feel like it is quite as heavy.  As I tried this scrub I felt like it was scrubbing away all the dead skin on my face.  It made my face feel so fresh and once it exposed the new skin underneath I felt very rejuvenated.  I love the feeling this scrub gives my face.  Even though I suffer from dry skin I still suffer from acne especially if I over wash my skin.  This exfoliating product can make you feel like it is triggering your pores at first and giving you more acne.  Be patient as this is a reaction that can happen right off the bat with any exfoliating product.  I find I get best results only using it about 2 times a week or so.  If I use it too many times my face breaks out more or my skin feels very sensitive.  When I only use it a couple times a week it cleanses just right and doesn't make my face break out too much.  I feel like it also gives my skin a chance to produce new skin cells.  I love that my skin overall feels healthier and looks younger when using this product.  If you are a looking to try a new exfoliating product I highly recommend you try Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts!!,5
"I purchased this fade product for the dark spots (sun, age, etc.) on my hands. I've used it for only a few weeks and my spots are fading noticeably. The packaging info does say that if it doesn't work in three months, to stop using it. So, I have quite a ways to go yet. I feel it's going to work completely judging by how it's starting out, and judging by how the 4 other Glytone products I've used to date have worked (wonderfully).A note about the odor. I've read several reviews (here and elsewhere) that say how ""disgusting"" or ""offensive"" the odor is. I didn't find that level of odor. What I smell is the chemicals, that heavy sort of scent that isn't pleasant, but it goes away immediately upon closing the container and doesn't linger in the air or on your skin. I've found it quite easy to simply hold my breath for the moment it takes me to apply the liquid to my hands (and one spot on my face). I am meaning to say, don't let the fear of a bad odor scare you from trying this product. Other products, they say, don't smell bad or have a floral scent. It seems to me that since they also say those other products don't work... maybe the right chemicals aren't in them. It's designed to take pigment off of skin... why would it smell rosey?I gave it four stars because of high price and because I don't have the full result yet. But I will update in a couple of months to let folks know if the spots fading all the way. Thanks.",4
"As others have said, Giovanni Direct Leave-In is a fantastic product which leaves my hair soft, manageable, and smooth.  I apply it on my wet hair after getting out of the shower.  I only need to use about a dime to quarter sized amount on my long nearly tailbone length hair.  I smooth it through with my fingers and then comb through my hair.  The comb slides through effortlessly after applying the product.  It really works a treat!",5
These aren't bad brushes... They are synthetic and work well for gel or structure gel.  They can be cleaned best with alcohol or a little pure acetone. Great dotting tools also.  They are standard size with a smaller end on the other side.,4
"I'm a fan of most Axe products. A little dab on a sponge or Axe Detailer goes a very long way, the lather is nice and thick, and the new &#34;Peace&#34; scent is quite nice.  The new scent is very pleasant, if not a bit hard to describe. It's definitely a masculine scent, lightly sweet, but without being overpowering or obnoxious.  Much like a very subtle men's cologne.  Leaves hair nice, clean, and manageable.  A great addition to the Axe line-up - I'll definitely be re-purchasing.",5
"The trick to this product is not to dilly dally. A dab will do you, but put in your foundation immediately afterward because it does soak into the skin (in a good way). If you wait to put on foundation, the primer may have already gone into your skin and thus making it slightly more difficult to apply the rest of your makeup.I absolutely love this product. It makes my foundation last longer, makes my face feel good, and doesn't leave my skin oily. Highly recommended. I'm buying more right now.",5
They look good when you can get them to stay on. I did get what I ordered & a good price for the set. All in all I'm happy with my purchase.,5
"THIS IS MY HUSBAND ACCOUNT!First I wash my face with the natural dead sea mud soap and then I use the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, my skin feels really soft in the first application, Im really impressed with the results I really like how my skin feels. I think is been beneficial for my skin and yes I will recommend this products from ADOVIA. High quality products.",5
"I tried this for a long time after I had my baby. I saw no reduction in my stretch marks and have since resigned myself to unfortunate genetics. Maybe I'll hit the lotto and afford laser therapy. In the meantime, I won't be wasting my money on false hope.",1
"I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months.  It is very creamy when first applied but then melts right into the skin so there's no greasy residue.  While I have well-entrenched areas of hyperpigmentation around my eyes and upper cheeks, Lumi*Essence use along with other products in Sweetsations' line (toner, eye area treatment, moisturizer/sunscreen) have brightened my skin and kept the areas from getting any darker.  No redness or irritation, no reaction to any ingredients in any of the Sweetsations line, all smell delightful, not too perfume-y.  Highly recommended for purity and scent (pleasant but not overpowering).Update May 2, 2013:  After using this product for more than a year (along with other products in the Sweetsation Therapy line), I am happy to report an overall evening and lightening of my entire face.  As part of an overall healthier lifestyle and improved self-care regimen, Lumi-Essence has proven invaluable.  If you are in this for the long haul and not just seeking a magic bullet ""quick fix"", I'd go with the entire line of Sweetsations Therapy skin care.  I am very pleased with the tone and texture of my skin.*Addendum 6/7/2013:  Use as directed continues to replenish and renew the texture of my skin.  Application of small amounts of Lumi*Essence to my neck and throat keep the skin supple and less ""crepe-y"" after a weight loss of about 25 lbs. over the past eight months.  Nothing else I've used has the noticeable effect of Sweetsation Therapy's skin care line.",5
"I find that Clearasil really gets the job done. It's affordable and after I use it, I do feel that my face feels refreshed and much cleaner. If you're looking for a great face wash, I'd definitely pick this product.Katiebabs",4
"I loved this for the first few weeks, but mine has aleady died and I have had it for about three months, and I didn't use it on a daily basis either.  will try again, and am hoping that it was just a problem with the one I had.",3
Izzy Wizzy Let's Get Busy makes all other colors sparkle and who doesn't like to sparkle!  So much fun!  And put it on top of a mood gel polish and now you have two reasons to sparkle and shine.,5
"I've tried every sort of cream to battle super dry winter hands, and finally resorted to this goop. It's very similar to Vaseline in texture and greasiness, as well as in the effect. But it's all plant-based, so much better for you. So for anyone who loves Vaseline and finds it of use I would strongly recommend this as a substitute. It's also more eco conscious. I would imagine it could also be good for kids' diaper rashes and other minor dryness. HOWEVER, I am not a big fan of Vaseline or of this goop. It's too greasy for me, doesn't absorb all that well, and for the greasiness factor I would expect more of a moisturizing/repairing effect. I feel that it just sits on top of my skin and doesn't really penetrate, so not that effective against dry winter skin. I also tried it on my lips, and while it's safer than Vaseline I still don't like the taste/smell. I've had a great olive oil/shea butter cream from Greece that worked much better to moisturize hands and will go back to that (B00FYPVV0O",3
Bought this for my mom for Christmas and ended up using it for myself! It's the best! It lengthens my eyelashes and stays on all day! Will buy again and again!!,5
"I went to the grocery store for the sole purpose of looking for a ""cheapie"" foundation to wear just around the house during the winter to keep my face from drying out.  I bought this foundation and just couldn't believe it!  I looked like I was walking around with a ""gold filter"" on my face (in case you don't know this - that is what they put over a camera lense while filming a model for a commercial to make her look flawless).  Just a wonderful, easy to blend makeup which looks better than Loreal's Visible lift brand.  LOVE this - blends very easily for a flawless look.  I'm relatively old too and if it makes me look like that, I can only imagine how wonderful it would be on someone even younger.  Highly recommend!",5
"I have curly hair, curly grey hair. I thought I would give this a try to see if I could soften the curl for a different look. It does the job fairly well. I had my daughter try it on her fine straight hair. It did almost nothing. She tried it on freshly washed and dried hair, and she also tried it on her hair after a day at work, to try to give it a bit of curl for our dinner out. It really didn't give her much more than w light wave. I regular curling iron works much better. Maybe it does a better job on a different texture of hair than either of us have?I guess you will have to try it and see.",3
"I am a big fan of the Yes To product line.  This is the third &#34;Blueberries&#34;  product I've purchased and I love it. It's not irritating, does not cause reactions on my sensitive skin, smells nice, delivers what it promises and is calming to the face.  I'm a believer in blueberries!",5
"This is not a holy grail product for me.  But it is my current favorite.  Unable to indulge in high end cosmetics these days, I find this does the double duty of highlighting and concealing decently.  I carry it in my purse for touch ups to the melty foundation that is from the same collection.  I recommend it, but there might be something better out there...",4
The scent is like a mix of citrus and incense which isn't overpowering in an early morning shower.  Some gels smell too sweet and too intense but Axe Harmony is much calmer.  Cleans well and does not require a lot of gel to get a good lather going.  Like it!,5
i love this deep conditioner it brought life back to my hair. I cannot wait to recommend it to all my friends,5
"I like this 3 in 1.shampoo, conditioner and bodywash. This is a perfect 'guy' product. Just lather up, head to toe, and rinse off. Great for the gym. The bottle is a little wobbly, and I prefer pumps over flip-open caps.  But  the product is very nice, versatile, smells good. Like the nice royal blue color. My Targe' generic is still my fave, and I have no problem using it as a shampoo and bodywash, and just skipping conditioner alltogether. But I like this stuff well enough, and would probably get this again, once in awhile ....maybe ...possibly ....okay, it's a long shot, but l do like it.",5
"This is my favorite eye shadow. It goes on smooth, blends easily and lasts all day.  The color is perfect to wear with anything, day or night.  You can't find a better shadow no matter what the price.",5
"I used Olay products for years and trusted the brand name for a long time. This product doesn't turn me off of Olay products - although I've tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream.The cream is not so creamy. It's quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin. Even when I use just the small amount dispensed by the pump, it takes a while to rub it in, and then if I am out in the sun, sweating makes the stuff run down my face. Also, there is a very strong perfume scent to the product (it makes me sneeze), and I found that not only did I have that same scent on my face, it was nearly impossible to wash off my hands after using the cream, so I end up smelling the stuff that makes me sneeze throughout the day.I had to stop using this product after a few attempts. It just doesn't work for my skin or lifestyle.",1
"I just go this in the mail, turned it over and saw sodium laureth sulfate in one of the first ingredients. Given all the negative press for SLS lately, and because that I'm trying to find something for my sensitive skin, I have to return it (and with no free shipping, either). There's also perfume in it.If SLS and perfume don't bother you, it's probably worth the buy, but I'd probably try one tube from a local drugstore before buying a 4-pack.",2
"I bought the ""Lingering Mocha"" and ""Opulent Organza"", their colors are beautiful on the picture shown but when I received them, they are way too dark and their texture is very sticky, somewhat frosted that feels heavy on my lips. They are both moisturizing when applied at first BUT after an hour or so, they start to dry up my lips, its like I'm wearing an old stock lipstick.",1
"Don't get me wrong, I love BB's Ageless Night Creme, which is my 2nd one that I recently bought via Amazon's Saved & Subscribed program to save only $3.16.  I am so regret to do so after I opened the mailing box, in which is an unboxed BB Ageless Night creme in a WHITE cap container.  Since, I have been using it, and I know that there's something wrong, so I compared it with my current one, which was bought at the local drug store few months ago.  The current one is SILVER cap with the SKIN FIRMING on the container, just like what is shown on the box.  I studied the WHITE CAP container detailly, it has BB copyright 2010 WITHOUT skin firming, which means that is a 2010 old version.  I also have checked with the BB website to ensure the current packing is SILVER cap.  Simply it is used on my face; I don't want to put something is over an year+.  Therefore, I returned it and cancelled the subscription and won't trust Amazon's saved & subscripted again.If I can put negative rating, I will do for Amazon's BAD services to the Subscribers.I have bought many items from Amazon; this time was totally unaccaptable!!",1
"Who knew this kind of wand was going to make it past the mall kiosks? I am so glad that i did not send 100+ dollars on one and went with remington.Once again, remingtom did not disappoint.Using a curling wand as compared to the traditional irons can take some practice, but its well worth the time spent on trial and errorThis wand heats up in a matter of seconds, it tops out at 410 degrees and does a magnificent job at creating strong spiral curls. Even better, they last all day! If the curls begin to wilt, you can use your fingers or a thin comb to stroke through them and create a looser yet still bouncy style.My advice, handle with caution product gets really hot, so for the first time users, please take advantage of the heat resistant glove :)",5
"I have limp hair and need a lot of work in order to give it any volume.  Often, I have to put a ton of hairspray in my hair just to make it last more than an hour.Honestly, I stray from TIGI products, because as a 27 year-old, the smell of their products and fanbase seemed to be too teen for me.  I admit I'm not crazy about the smell of this hairspray, but I am really impressed by how shiny it makes my hair.  Not sure if this is normal, but it also seems to create a wave in my hair that I find really cute- like an extra bonus.On it's own, it doesn't create the ""puff"" that I'm looking for, but it does hold well if enough is used.  I have found there is a really good combination between this product and my usual TRESemm&eacute; Extra Hold.This has made me curious to try other TIGI products!",4
don't let the name fool you. it has a nice light scent. it can be worn casually. really nice light weight scent that last for a nice while,4
"I really love this stuff. I bought it for use in making homemade shaving cream and such and it is of good quality. It does wonders for my dry hands and i even tried using a little on a small cut and it stopped the bleeding and pain immediately.  The smell takes some getting used to. I liken it to a somewhat earthy tobacco kind of smell. With essential oils that is taken care of. It came packaged in a brown, lined, resealable bag.",5
My wife loves this new product! She is using it with her skin cleansing system and told me that it is restoring her youthfulness.  She has sun damaged skin and it has already been helping to fade them away.  She is excited about restoring the collagen in her skin while increasing the smoothness.  Thank you for an awesome product!,5
"I've never had any luck with liquid, and seeing as how I am not very coordinated, I stuck to gel and an angled brush. Problem with gel is it smudges. My first time applying liquid eyeliner is with this product, and I think I've converted. It gets a nice dark line above my lashes and does not budge until I need to remove makeup and wash my face. Bottom lashes I don't like done too much so I stick with a light pencil liner.",5
"It really does polish your face and make it glow.  Use no more than twice a week because you don't want to over dry your skin.Anyone who wants a glowing complexion, give this a try!!",5
"But does last a solid 8 hours which is all I care about as it lasts through the workday which is all I care about.  Cherry is a great true bright red color, without being gaudy.  It gets a little &#34;crummy&#34; / flaky towards the end of day but otherwise, is a solid product.",5
"I don't notice a real big difference in my dark circles, however I love the feeling of product on my eyes. Its light and I use it morning and night. I tried using another cheap eye gel but it just wasn't the same, so I've gone back and bought two when I saw the price a little cheaper.",5
"The front of the bottle states Oil Control Foam Wash. So the first real question I had was if it would deliver on the Oil Control. I'm sure it differs from face to face, but for me it works great. I use it several times a week, just once a day at night. I don't recommend using it more than one time a day, as it does dry out the skin. At first I thought the dryness it made would be a problem, but I just put some lotion on afterward and it was perfect. I'm really liking the oil-free skin it leaves behind.The container is pretty good. My only complaint is that the lid is super smooth, making it hard to get off when my hands are wet. So I leave it unsealed. The pump is curved up, making it easy to push. The pump(top) screws off, so I'll be able to reuse the bottle, which is nice.The directions state only this: Massage foam onto damp skin. Rinse.Like most face-care products, it's lacking in details. How much do they expect me to use? Just a little? Do I need more? How many times a day do they recommend? They're the ones who ran the tests, I wish they'd at least give some general use advice.I use a single pump or half a pump over a lightly rinsed face, rub it in, then rinse again with warm water (no more than once a day).Being foam wash, it's easy to use, really nice to wash with. I've used it for a couple weeks and the liquid level in the bottle isn't much reduced. Foam wash tends to be a bit more expensive, as compared to, say,Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser 16oz (Pack of 2), which I've been using for years. Frankly, I like the Cetaphil Facial Cleanser just as well as the Foam Wash. This Foam Wash, however, realllllly helps with my oily skin.I like the smell, I didn't find the fragrance a problem, it didn't seem too strong for me. I use a fairly scentless face lotion so it's nice to have a bit of color. Er. Scent.The Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash fulfilled my expectations, and I enjoy using it. Whether or not I continue to use it once this bottle is gone will depend on the observed benefits over time.",5
"The Olay Regenerist Anti-Aging Eye Roller comes in a most unusual applicator that worked well for me.  The three tiny rollers dispense the serum very easily and smoothly without my hands ever touching the serum.  Using it as a twice daily product, I found there were a few times that the dried serum did flake after applying make-up, so I switched to using the product only at night.  I'm fortunate that I do not have puffiness under my eyes so I could not judge the effectiveness in reducing under-eye puffiness.  I do have occasional puffiness in my eyelids from allergies and contact lens irritation, but the product is not to be used on the eyelids and can create problems if getting into the eye itself.  That left me with judging how well it worked on lines and wrinkles.  I honestly can't decide it if helped or not.  It seems as though some fine lines did look smoother, but it could be because I wanted it to work.  I have tried other products, including the Olay Pro-X Deep Wrinkle Treatment, that seem to work better.  My mother fights wrinkles and dark circles under her eyes and says that the best product she has tried is StriVectin-SD eye cream (very expensive, but works the best for her).  A slightly less costly, but very good product she tried was Kinerase Under Eye Rescue.  The Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Eye Roller was extremely interesting to test, but I'm not sure I can recommend it to everyone.  It is one of those products that you need to try once and decide for yourself if it works for you.  My  recommendation is to try it once, but using it only at night,  if you are interested in the new applicator and see if it works for you.",3
"inexpensive, tea treey, well there's not too much to say from me, I'm sure it's a good quality product with lots of magical potential",5
"These wipes do a nice job of removing my makeup, or simply refreshing my face.  It left my face feeling clean without any residue feeling.  The citrus scent was light and pleasing - it's a bit soothing. I would pay the $4.95 Amazon is charging, but I wouldn't pay the retail price of $19.95.",4
not bad for the price. lashes are very soft but i had to trim them on the sides because they are very long. ends are tucked under the sheet which makes it a little difficult to remove.,3
"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful Colors I have medium/ dark skin and these colors POP on me. I recommend this Blush set to all!!! Great Vibrant colors, Great Price and Looks way more expensive than it is. Excellent Service and Fast Delivery from Seller. Thank you Again I am Extremely happy with my purchase.",5
"Like many reviewers, I have elevens in between my eyebrows. I'm in my early thirties and definitely take care of my skin, but I've never found any magic cream that can deal with the deeper wrinkles between my eyes. I've also noticed that they are worse when I wake up in the morning from scrunching my face while I sleep.Frownies are definitely kind of strange, but the concept is very simple. Basically you take the small, triangle-shaped piece of cardboard, wet the side with adhesive, and firmly apply it to your skin before going to bed. It physically forces your muscles to stay put and not scrunch up with you're sleeping.I am shocked at how well it works. The very first morning I woke up, gently peeled off the triangle, and couldn't believe that my skin was totally smooth with no wrinkles. Obviously some of the wrinkles came back during the day, but every night my skin stays firm and I wake up without wrinkles. Over the course of the past month I've noticed the lines are slowly diminishing. Obviously, it only works if you use it consistently, but Frownies are pretty cheap and easy to use, so it really isn't that much of a hassle.Also, I've been using mine for about a month now and I've had no issues with it falling off while I'm asleep. Just make sure you're not wearing any heavy creams/lotions on the area where you're putting it.",5
This was such a bargain. It arrived SUPER FAST for super cheap too. I should have bought 2 for myself and more for my friends. Thanks!,5
"So I just received my Coastal Scents Eclipse Concealer! (Early) but. I'm very pleased by it. It is very thick which this means that I'll just need a little to cover up my blemishes. I love the fact that it's small because, that means that, it will be going everywhere with me! It's a very creamy texture and really smooth. So If you have Oily Skin make sure you apply a powder after applying it to seal that coverage it. I'm waiting to use it because I want to use it with my Beauty blender (Whenever it get's here). Also, don't worry about not having your shade to quickly you can always mix and match.(Ohh just a tip to make sure you get full coverage match the shades with your chest because, that's the color your foundation and concealer should be) In total it's a nice small 15 color concealer palette to add to your collection!",5
The fragrance it is exquisite and it is smells very masculine.Ideal for gift!The package of delivery it is ideal size.My rating is five stars is:1-Product Quality2-Shipping costs.3-Time Delivery.Thanks.,5
"Today I received the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts Dead Sea Salt Exfoliating Crystals free of charge for my honest Review.  I applied the Crystals to my clean face following directions rubbing gently in circles and then rinsed off.

I Highly reccomend the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts.  Thank you for reading my Review.  Jerri Davis",5
"I'm not yet able to say for sure how effective this is specifically for Southeastern allergens because spring has only just begun, but I can at least say that it has a great combination of homeopathic elements to it. I don't know that it's so specifically formulated for the region's pollen explosion (which hasn't happened yet), but it basically is trying to cover the whole spectrum of allergic reactions to allergens. My strongest allergy is dust, which isn't the most regional thing, so I'm going to have a family member who has a worse reaction to the spring pollen try this when it hits, and will update this soon.One note: as with many homeopathic treatments, this is going to work differently with different people--it may be more effective for one person over the other, and allergies are a pretty idiosyncratic thing. So I'd say it's pretty much worth a try for anyone who can't find anything else effective--and as those of us with allergies know, usually a single medication or shot only helps alleviate symptoms rather than cure us completely. So whatever can potentially help is worth a shot in my book!",3
It's a good product.  I like to use it in between uses of my other favorite tanning cream.  Hey - the sun is bad mmmk - so sunless tanning is a nice way to have some color without all the skin damage.  I wouldn't recommend this for your face or neck as it can be a bit streaky.,4
"I use Dr. Bronner's Castile soap (almond is my favorite) for just about everything.  It will gently clean vases, glasses, cups, laundry, carpet, etc.  I even use it to clean the interior of my Louis Vuitton handbag!  I buy it by the bottles whenever it is on sale.Also, I LOVE this hand soap.  The spearmint/peppermint is my favorite.  I recommend it to everyone!Also, the peppermint body lotion is to die for !!",5
I bought this for my grown daughter and she is very pleased with it. She can dry the polish on both hands at the same time in about 15 minutes. I'm going to get one for my granddaughter for her birthday.,5
I like Tea Tree and this stuff kept my face refreshed after each use in the morning. It also smelled great and last you quite a while before you run out to the store and get another one. It doesn't dry out your skin depending on the type of skin condition that you have. I believe this was for combination to oily skin.,4
"I loved the product. My hair is very coarse and it worked wonders on all the years of damage between flat irons, perms, dying, and extensions. After just one wash my hair feels softer then ever. My hair is even bouncy and shiny again. Has a great fresh floral smell and not to over overpowering. I would highly recommended this product to my friends, family and to everyone.adventuresofaudrianna.blogspot.com",5
"This soap is my new favorite, it smells wonderful and feels great on my skin( its also liked by the other members of the house so that's a plus). For some reason this particular scent is hard to find at stores near me so when I saw it on Amazon I was pretty excited.At the current price it averages about forty nine cents per bar which is a good value in my book. Free shipping makes the deal even sweeter because I don't have to waste any gas trying to find it.I recommend this soap to anyone looking for not only a bargain but a darn good smelling soap.",5
"I use to adore this eyeliner. It was always a pain to apply, they need a different brush, but,it stayed on all day long, even in Caribbean humidity.The last time I purchased this, the wrapping was torn, and I had racoon eyes,within an hour, of the application.I am finally realizing that many, NOT ALL, make-up purchases on AMAZON,are subject to questionable presentation, when we all know, make-up cannotget contaminated or you can get an infection.I do not condone purchasing this. It is a &#34;roll of the dice&#34;, IMO.",2
"My nails have never looked better-they break and split less.My nails and cuticles aren't overly dry and when they do break or split, it's not down to the quick.",5
Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser. Lather up and try them - they work!,5
"I typically have wavy, frizzy hair that looks like straw. Not anymore! Since using this product my hair looks ah-ma-zing! I spritz it pretty liberally before I air dry or blow dry my hair and after it dries it is incredibly soft, silky and smooth. I am not even using a frizz serum anymore, this has done the trick for me. Also it smells so pretty! I will definitely buy again and again.",5
"I like this product. My lips are a tiny bit dark, so it's hard for me to find colors that actually show up in a pretty way. This color is beautiful on me and doesn't cause my lips to dry. The color fades over time, but even the fading color leaves a pretty lip stain. I'm a fan!",4
Only 4 of the colors actually changed color with temperature. The 2 glitter ones would not color change at all :( but the other 4 worked as expected!,3
I recieved these on time and in good condition.  I love these.  I might not pay to have my nails done again.  These image plates make doing your nails fun.  They are easy to use.  I suggest using the white or black top coats with these.  The base color is your choice.I used these on my nails and loved the look. Then I loaned them to my daughter who had fun with her nails and is going to order her own set.  If your like fancy nails in a do it your self package order these.  LINDA W,5
"I Loved using the Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner. The smell is INCREDIBLE, and my hair turned out looking fabulous. Since I process my hair a lot it is really dry and tired. The Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner brought my hair back to life.  The Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner is a huge hit with me, and I highly recommend you giving this product a try.  This is definitely one product that will not live you disappointed!Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.",5
"This is perfect because it's not so expensive.  It cleans my face, stimulates it and my face feels so good afterwards - a definite yes.",5
"I put this shimmer on over every color I have - it goes with anything, and makes them look amazing. It also looks great over a french tip. It's definitely not ment to go on solid, but it is one of the most useful gelish colors I've got, because it can change the look of any of the other colors. Absolutely beautiful. Shimmers all different colors, not just silver as it looks in the pic.",5
"Feels good, makes my skin glow! I even use it as a daily shower scrub sometimes. Love the heat activation, wish I could find it in stores near me!",4
My eyes love this stuff. They are less puffy and my dark circles are much improved. The fine lines are much less now and softer looking. My nose loves this stuff to!,5
"I consider my skin to be somewhat sensitive, as well as combination oily/dry.  I'm happy with the way my face feels after washing with it; no soapy residue, no medicated tingling, just a nice clean feel.  I hadn't read the warning about avoiding the eyes, but this surprisingly didn't bother or irritate them at all.  I like the light fragrance as well, smells tend to bother my sensitive nose, and this doesn't ""offend"" my nose at all.  My pre-teen has also been using it and she's happy as well.  We are running low already and she asked if I'd buy some more.  Mission accomplished Clearasil & Vine ;)",4
"Tweezerman makes very nice, quality products. This set is no different. I gave it to my mom, and she has loved both parts of the set thus far. She especially likes how the file comes in its own little case. It makes putting it in her purse very cute and convenient.",5
"Great pencil and gel for African American, natural brown color matches well with my original brows. Easy to apply and quick drying time",5
This is a comfortable and nice sleep mask. I used on a metro train ride and was good! Be careful of your valuables (of course!). Overall felt great. Sample provided in exchange of a fair review.,5
"The best Moroccan hair oil on the market. Never greasy. I blow dry until my hair is slightly damp...add a bit of the oil, then finish drying. Always pleased with the results.",5
"So I'm a guy, and I have no idea how I get so many whiteheads and blackheads in my nose. Before I was enlightened, I thought that the blackheads were little hairs sticking out of my nose. Then I realized that it was just oil and dirt - after using these pore strips.The combo pack is great because I can use the &#34;face&#34; ones to do the parts of my cheeks right next to the nose. Highly recommend getting these and using them once every week or two!",4
"First of all I loved the ingredient list -- and that it was in ONE cream rather than two or three -- then the package came and it is very nicely presented in it's own drawstring bag.  I have been using it at least once (twice when I remember) each day for several days now.  It does tingle as soon as it is applied, but not a stinging tingle -- more like a cooling, refreshing feeling.  My eye area is less puffy and even though I do not have a big problem with really dark circles -- my under eye area is smoother and brighter.",4
"The reviews on this product are very helpful.  I used a old narrow mascara wand which I had cleaned, 2 Q-tips and a little olive oil in a small, small dish.  I used half of a capsule of dye and mixed up the dye. Then I applied the oil around my brow with a Q-Tip.  I applied the dye to the mascara wand very thinly and then brushed the dye on my brows. I took the clean end of the Q-Tip I had used to apply the oil and wiped off any dye that had gotten on my skin (very gently).  I had a wet towel handy and after 30 seconds I wiped off the dye.  My brows needed more color so I dyed them a second time.  The color was just right and I had no color on my skin.  The color is a darker brown, so I highly suggest that you wipe the dye off after 20 or 30 seconds the first time to make sure it is not too dark for you.  I had plenty of dye left over so I don't think you need to use a whole capsule of dye unless you have a lot of brow to dye (my brows are thin).  Anyway, be patient, don't skip any steps and you will be pleased with this product.",5
"I've been using the Clear line of ethnic products for my daughter's hair (she's from Taiwan, of mostly aboriginal origin), and I'm a fan. This product is no exception. For me, though, as a Caucasian woman, it's too greasy, but it's perfect for her.",4
I did not care for this product. I did not like the way it smelled on me. I would not buy it again.,2
"From what I've read on the packaging, and from what I remember reading on the description online before having this item shipped to me, the main purpose for this facial cleanser is for removing make-up...that, or, it is a product that is highly optimal for the removal of makeup.Well, I don't wear makeup, and my work doesn't require me to get &#34;dirty,&#34; (though I wouldn't mind;) however, those times that my face just becomes &#34;grimy&#34; from the days activities - ESPECIALLY those days I'm around and helping to take care of animals, specifically dogs - these cleansing wipes do an incredibly effective job when it comes to cleaning deep and cleansing the face (and neck, too...perfectly safe). My face FEELS fresh, clean, and - to a certain extent - new, or, refreshed.Now, I'm not a HUGE citrus fan, but the scent is not overwhelming/overpowering, AND, it's not as if it smells like one citrus fruit over another citrus ______(fill in the blank with a citrus-scented/flavoured food). I've used a product or two that used citrus - can't remember if it was for scent or for health purposes - and my skin kind of felt like it was &#34;burning&#34; or &#34;stinging&#34; a bit after the use of this(these) other product(s). NOT so for these wipes. I've yet to experience that stinging/burning/irritated feeling I've felt with other products in the past.The packet itself is easy to open, but not so easy that a toddler or young one wanting to reach up on the counter to grab and explore could open initially. However, I DID notice that over time, while I didn't use it every day, the more I opened and closed it, the more I had to make efforts to ensure that the seal was secure to ensure the wipes did not dry out overnight. Funny, though, speaking of drying out, when I first opened the packet, I almost got &#34;squirted&#34; because of the bit of excess liquid that is inside to keep the wipes moisturized!  In any case, other than the seal being a bit finicky (at least, on my package it was), I don't have any HUGE issues with the facial wipes.I noticed that the wipes go a LONG way, in that I can use 1 wipe to do a nice, slow, thorough &#34;sweep&#34; of my face and neck, and there is quite a bit that is picked up, more than what I did notice. Additionally, it would appear that one doesn't need to use MUCH of the cloth, that (the old adage) &#34;A little bit goes a long way,&#34; is extremely applicable for these wipes. Now, would they function similarly/the same for makeup users? Well...yes and no. Now, granted, I've just said I'm not one to normally wear makeup, but for those SPECIAL occasions, I will, and afterwards, I would not like to use umpteen cloths/wipes and/or x number of bottles of makeup remover - well, maybe not to that extreme, but I say that to make a point, that the less of something I can use, thus making it last longer, the more I'm going to WANT to use it. Thus, for balls, weddings, and other events that might require makeup, such as a variety of performances (I did do some theatre a fair ways back in my past - and believe me, I would have LOVED to have had these back then!) Depending on how thick the makeup is - theatre makeup, I could see as working, but not working as effective/efficient as everyday makeup - will depend upon how effective it would be. I would say that for someone who wears makeup everyday, not tooooooo thick or heavy, mind you,  the way it works for me now just as a &#34;typical&#34; facial cleanser would be about the same. It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it's a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)",3
"I couldn't do my makeup every morning without this brush! This is the mini brush of the larger flat top kabuki brush, and this brush is great for concealer, for setting powder, and for eye makeup. It is soft, gentle and washes really nicely! I wouldn't do my makeup without it!",5
"The product I received was brand new. The stamper is east to use but the scraper is a little hard to clean. Overall, very pleased.",4
"The Mineral soap arrived in great condition, in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came, and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong, soap smell.  I know, imagine that, the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells, (which, really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However,  During a shower, the smell is not that strong, and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter, so he is around dust, dirt, and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now, and I can feel a difference in my skin, as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do,  he scrubs them twice daily, before the new Mineral Soap, and now, with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately, before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future, as well as recommend to everyone!",5
"I've used about every Axe shower gel.  Honestly, I like that this one is rich and luxurious, but otherwise it is unimpressive.  The smell I found more to be like that fake ""new car smell"".  I didn't find it revitalizing in any way.  It is not a bad product, and probably worth buying once for variety, but I would not consider it one of my must-have Axe staples.  There are many Axe shower gels which I like much better.",3
I love using this on my skin.  It made it noticably smoother.  I use it day and night and am addicted to this stuff.  A little definately goes a long way. I only use one pump on my finger and dot it on both checks forhead and chin.  I've got a little more than half a bottle left since March and it's now October.,5
This was a good product protecting the hair before the damaging heat for the flat iron.  It made my hair very shiny and got rid of frizz.  I did not need to add anything after finishing iron hair.  The style would last for 2 days as well so that was nice that I could save a day in processing hair as well.,5
"I received this as a sample and at first used it as a concealer under makeup.. I saw nothing.. Then after forgetting to apply for a few days, I put it on over my makeup..  Apparently this did it, my eyes look so much brighter .. I even tried a little on my brow bone for added light..  Not sure if this is the correct way to use but for me, I love it",5
"Perfect, classic green mask. From the beginning of time, ladies have worn green facial masks. This is every bit as good as you think it should be. Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean without being dried out.",5
"I gave this a chance since the reviews were great and now i know why! I love this moisturizer! I bought myself a 2nd one and my sister too! Smooth, gentle, and works! A must for all ladies!",5
"I have a problem with my acrylic nails lifting. I bought this product to go along with the CND Solar Nails Radical system. It's not as strong as I need it to be - lifting is still a problem. Now I have resorted to using this product, letting it dry, and using BondAid for a second coat - then applying the acrylic. So far the combination is working well.",3
"I purchased the Nars Matte Multiple in Aliti. Its a amazing bronzer or contour shade. These go on so smoothly and beautifully it looks like a second skin with a little color (if that makes sence). I now want every color! The matte multiple looks so nice on the skin, and blend like a dream.  The color range is also really nice. I can't wait to try the Matte Multiple in Orgasm,  my favorite blush color of all time!I also want to mention this amazon store, Bluemercury inc. I was originally sent the wrong color and I needed it for a job that Saturday (it was sold out everywhere in the color I needed). They immediately sent the right color, Altai. I revieved it a day before it was expected.  There customer service was above and beyond.  If they have a product your looking for, pirchase it from blurmercury inc!",5
I love this polish. It is very eye'catching. I've used it as an all over color or to do a french manicure. Or you can put it on top of any base color. he only downside is it is very hard to remove.,5
Like the different sizes of the dotting pens. Can save money at the nail salon by doing my own designs.,5
"This is stealthy sex!!  The sweet, girly pinkness casts the spell, and the sexy undertones reel them in!!  I love this one in the summer, it's light and sweet enough for warm weather.",5
"I am not a professional however I speak from experience with years of skin troubles, dermatologists, estheticians and so forth.This is hands down the best sunscreen/day time mositurizer / BB type product available. I started this when dermatologists did not make a difference and I went to a specialist dealing with skin. It's the best!",5
I recently got this Suave shampoo and a Tressame shampoo. Both are made by the Unilever company and as far as the ingredients go almost identical. But the Tressame is half the price. The difference is in the scent added to this Suave line of shampoos. The macadamia oil and white orchid smells nice. It has a nutty/buttery type smell. Can't say I can pick out the white orchid scent. Would I keep buying this? Probably not. Given the ingredients are the same as the Tressame shampoo but this one costs twice as much I'd go with the less expensive shampoo. But still it cleans well and smells nice so if price does not matter to you then this is recommended. Hope this helps a little in making your decision!,4
"This works really well! There is no doubt that you get a smoother more even skin after using this. Im a guy who works outside a lot and this helps to clean and even my face, also has helped with mild acne",5
This hand cream saves my hands during winter. I also use it for my feet and elbows before bed. The tube is small enough to fit into my purse. My first one had a flip top but now I can't find the flip tops anymore.,5
are difficult to work with but i think is because i'm new working with it. but the idea about getting more practice fingers is good.,3
Very disappointed. I only received the cuticle nipper and it did not arrive with the other contents as advertised. I made a complaint to them and they said that they would send the other contents and that was over a month ago and they still have not sent it. Don't buy from this company. They appear to be scammers.,1
"It didn't come with directions or a dropper so it's hard to get into a small nail polish bottle. It cost a bit more than I would have liked. The smell is awful so use in a well ventilated area, I know it a solvent but man did the smell linger, and gave me a headache. On the plus side it shipped super fast.",3
"I love the silky feel of this night cream. It has a nice but subtle fragrance. My face feels refreshed in the morning, and it doesn't cost a fortune. My skin is quite sensitive, and I have no problems using Olay. I recommend it!",5
"tried this out on my back to try and get rid of some scars...it really didn't do anything at all? i'm not sure if it was expired or what, but yeah..it didn't do anything! i felt a slight sting for a few minutes and then it was over. i probably wouldn't try this product again, but then again maybe i will",3
"You know how you are tired at the end of the day and you don't want to take the 5 minutes it would take to wash your face?  Well, Ponds has the answer with these towelettes.  THEY ARE FAB!  You can wash your face with the towelette and chuck it in the bin when you are done.  These are safe enough to remove eye makeup and mascara without hurting your eyes.They are convenient to tote around (think airports, think campgrounds, think fitness center) and gentle enough on your skin to prevent breakouts.  These are a true find for those who want to take care of their skin, without being high maintenance, and great for those of us with sensitive skin",5
"Banana Boat has always been a name I feel comfortable choosing when it comes time to buy sunblock. My first choice for effectiveness is Blue Lizard, but Banana Boat doesn't have that heavy, theatre grease feeling that Blue Lizard has. Also, based on the crazy cost of Blue Lizard, Banana Boat is a great option for days when you won't be in the sun nonstop (say, the beach). I don't knock myself out choosing between ""hydrate"" and ""cool sensation"" etc.---if the number is high enough, I go with it. It's much better than the Coppertone we had last year, which smelled like coconut but left a greasy residue on clothes. I also love that this size fits in my purse---great for those impromptu meetings at the playground. Will buy again.",4
"I just recently discovered the goodness of InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum and now I'm a big believer! After using it for about 2 weeks, I can definitely see and feel a big difference on my face. My skin is brighter, smoother, and definitely clearer. I look in the mirror or at my pictures, and I'm very happy with what I see. Considering the fact that this is all natural,  I will definitely continue using this amazing product!",5
beautiful summer color,5
"I had tried the chewable tablets for IBS from this same brand for 4 or 5 months and found I was still having a lot of symptoms of IBS on a daily basis.  Now that I've started taking the caplets, I experience symptoms maybe once a week, on average.  I only gave it 4 stars because I still have problems every once in a while, but the majority of the time it works really well.  I used to suffer from bloating, gas, cramping, and diarrhea on a daily basis, so any help to me is wonderful!",4
"It can be hard to find something that is strong enough to clean your face but still gentle enough to not irritate your skin- especially if you have eczema, psoriasis or acne! I do not have Acne but at the moment I have a couple hormonal breakouts and since I am washing my face in the morning and the night with this soap I am noticing that my skin looks much more balanced. Don't be fooled by the dark appearance! It foams nicely and the foam will be clear to white. The soap also feels very nice and light and also drys super quick so it is very hygienic to use. It smells also very nice and fresh! I recommend this!",5
I reallt love this oil. I have very fine curly hair & I tend to straighten. This is great for taming frizzies or as a treatment at night.,5

"The positives of this product:It's not greasy.It's lightweight and seems to absorb in the skin quickly.It comes in an attractive container, or is nicely packaged.It's reasonably priced. You get 18oz for $6.And the Suave brand is one that is traditionally reliable and trustworthy. I have used several of their products over the years and been satisfied.The drawbacks of this product:Moroccan Argan oil or Maroccanoil is all the rage these days (it's like shea butter, it's infused in almost everything). However,I don't think that it added much to the scent or the feel of this product. Of course the benefits of having a product that contains this oil isn't necessarily about the smell but the benefits to the skin (moisturize, sooth etc). But I was expecting a little more regarding the smell. Something more calming, and somewhat soothing. Don't get me wrong, it has a scent that isn't a strong or overwhelming scent (to me), but it doesn't exactly knock your socks off as a wonderful one. It's just ok. And initially, I found myself smelling my hands and arms constantly, trying to place the scent because it kind of nagged at me.And if your skin is really dry, I am not sure if this product would be the best thing for you. While it does moisturize some, it didn't necessarily provide the best coverage with one application. Some, for example those with really dry skin, would not necessarily like the fact that it is so lightweight (not creamy but a little on the thin side). To me, it doesn't seem, to offer the kind of protection that I need, hence the 3.5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it isn't awful, but I prefer a heavier lotion (like Nivea, Eucerin, Keri or L'Occitane Hand Lotion),on that gives me more moisture with better coverage. But never fear, I plan to put this bottle of lotion in my teenage boy's bathroom or my guest restroom for them to use.",3
"The tape looks pretty, but it tends to pop up on the end of the nail. The only thing is, I think it's more because I have no idea what the heck I'm doing, and also have never given manicures before. So I wouldn't hold it against the people at World Pride. I just need someone to show me what to do. LOLOLOLI think nail people do this a lot. It made me tired and it was too hard. I might just go get them done at a manicurist- all stripes- and watch and learn. Other people's jobs are hard. :P",3

"""Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharid found naturally in the human body. It not only helps cushion and lubricate joints, but is also a major component of skin tissue. The skin holds almost fifty percent of your body's hyaluronic acid in the skin. It is also found in joints connective tissues and eye fluids. Hyaluronic Acid Serums not only plump and moisturizing skin, they also help heal and comfort skin. Hyaluronic Acid Serums also prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  Hyaluronic Acid has anti-irritant, anti inflammatory and hydrating properties.It not only helps skin retain moisture but it creates a cushion to help plump out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is viscous and gooey but absorbs into the skin without any residue, making it a popupar ingredient in serums, creams and make up products"". Dermatology ReviewI have been using hyaluronic acid serum for 3-4 years. I am a woman of indeterminate age, and I have smooth skin. I have wrinkles, yes, but less than other woman my age. My skin care regime is cleansing skin, applying hyaluronic acid serum, then moisturizer. Fairly simple, but effective.  Taking care of and protecting your skin is one of the most important factors in good skin care. I have found this Luxury Hyaluronic acid serum's to be very effective.The Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum arrived well packaged. It comes in a very attractive turquoise and white package. Directions, ingredients, warnings and other information are imprinted on the package. The bottle is of a good size, 1.7 oz, and for the price it is very affordable. The bottle is attractive with a silver cover. The pump gives a small droplet of serum and is enough to cover your face. The scent is very nice, light and pleasant. There is a tightening feeling which is probably do to the witch hazel in the product. Allow the serum to dry, and your skin feels very smooth with a nice glow. I use moisturizer, but you don't need to, the serum will add moisture and smoothness to your face. I apply the serum drops to my hands after applying to my face, smoothes my hand also. This serum remains all day under my make-up , and there is a glow to my cheeks and forehead. My skin feels smooth and looks good all day. At night I follow the same ritual, I cleanse my face thoroughly, apply the hyaluronic acid serum, allow to dry and then apply moisturizer. My skin feels and looks good.There is no magic to this hyaluronic acid serum, it does what it promises. Helps to supply missing moisture, gives smooth skin and a glow.  I was given this product to use and review, after using it for several days, I will purchase another bottle once this is gone. This is a very effective serum, the price is right and it feels good on my skin.Recommended. prisrob 02-24-14",5
"Not sure why this received such high reviews... the quality isn't very good.  My teacher even asked me if I dropped them... which I hadn't.  With real hair, they seem passable--but good luck trying to cut synthetic hair with them.",2

"Let your creative side go wild...these are fun to use & will even work with dark hair depending on the color you choose.Hair chalk works best & quickest on damp hair. I have light, reddish blonde hair & didn't think I'd need to wet it, but it was taking forever to transfer any color from the chalk when my hair was dry. The process went much quicker after I dampened my hair. Oh my gosh, be prepared for messy hands...even when using the chalk on dry hair, my hands got messy. It was even worse when I started dampening my hair. You might want to wear gloves when you're applying the chalk. Also, the chalk can, probably will, get on your clothing until it's set with hair spray or by heat styling...and even then, after setting the color, there's a chance the color might rub off onto your clothing.You might not want to use hair chalk on rainy days...I have a sneaky suspicion that the chalk/color will run onto your face, neck, clothing, etc. if it gets wet.There are numerous you tube videos demonstrating how to use hair chalk. I learned quite a bit when I watched the you tube video by Kandee Johnson.These chalks are non-toxic - it is very important to only purchase non-toxic hair chalk.These non-toxic hair chalks are similar to the pastel chalks used by artists. However the artist's pastels might contain ingredients that the FDA does not allow to be used for this purpose.review sample provided",5
"This new Remington Tourmaline Straightener is fantastic!  I'm so impressed with the abililty to set a more gentle temperature.  I also like the curved body of the styler that allows for softer waves than previous Remington Straighteners.My last straightener was too hot and had a tendency to create a bit of frizz - not so with the Tourmailine and the controlled temperature of this styler.  I also like the safety of an auto-off feature.The included DVD taught me how to create some new styles, but I don't think I'll be running a straightener through 1"" sections off my hair every morning before work!All in all, this is a great straightener with controlled heat that creates great styles.",5

"I selected this cream for my 18 month old, who had been having some rashes due to dry skin on her legs.  I don't believe the rash she had was related to Eczema but when I had the opportunity to pick up this cream, I had the feeling it would do the job, and I was right! I had been rubbing Aveno Lavender Body Cream on her legs for a couple weeks but her legs still felt dry and flaky.  I used a small amount of this cream for two night and BOOM the rash and dry skin was gone. This stuff is awesome!",5
this pallette is great. the colors are highly pigmented and i love the light burgandy color for my transition color. the white shattered but its ok because i didnt use it much. overall a great pallette to have.-XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com,5
"Update 2/28/2014 I had dry hands this winter and they cracked at knuckles and underneath  on folds wheni used my fingers.  I coated in this Nivea creme and they turned red and started to feel better. At the night I put on think with old silk opera gloves and by morning all the cracks had healed.I love the creme over the lotion. It is thick and stays on better. In the fall when my heels crack I, I pull out the Nivea creme and keep them saturated at night when I can stay off my feet. By morning they are better and healed in 2 to 3 days with frequent applications at night.",5

"I always set this bottle in the sink of warm water for a 2 minutes, shake well, and then pour it into my hair products. I used with a heat cap since I have low porosity hair. My natural hair seem very soft, shiny, and manageable. Great product!",4
"I wanted a thicker moisturizer for the winter. I wanted to try some other products but the one's I wanted to try aren't available in my area. I came across this while browsing in my local walgreens. I noticed that it didn't have any mineral oil or petroleum and that it was also on sale. I tried it on dry hair first and worked well. It's even better applied on wet hair. I give it four stars instead of five because I's still a little iffy on the scent. It kind of smells medicated to me. My boyfriend thinks it smells like hand soap. I think it's different for everybody. But anyway, it's a good moisturizer :)",4
I gave it as a present and she was really excited to get it. She has not said anything about it to me yet.,5
This works on long hair. I purchased another and it did not work on waist length hair. This works! It's easy to use and I believe will last provided you use this on dry hair. I recommend this for long haired ppl who haven't been able to achieve the perfect bun with other products. Slip your hair through the middle and start rolling at your ends. It hold as well (I slept in my bun and it was there in the morning)!,4
"I bought bottle after bottle of Obagi serum because I actually use it for the stretch marks and loose skin on my arms, along with tretinoin (yes it has given me amazing results) but the Obagi is soooo expensive!I needed to find a cheaper alternative due to a change in my finances, which I was not very happy about because when it comes to my skin I always want the cream of the crop.I chose this serum in particular because it was actually one of the best sellers as far as vitamin C products go and had a lot of good reviews so I'd thought that I would give it a try. At first I thought all of these reviews were fake, because for this serum to be so cheap, there is just no way it worked as well as Obagi, right?Well let me tell you, ever since I swapped my Obagi out for this, I've noticed a MORE noticeable improvement in the condition of my arm skin. I've been using it for about 2 weeks and I'm very pleased with the results. I didnt say ""miraculous"" or ""amazing""...but noticeable.I think the Obagi serum is soo expensive because it simply carries the name. But do I think it is as effective as this Nufountain stuff?? No, I dont. Because the Obagi serum is very oily, and I am under the assumption that the oil prohibits the skin from truly absorbing the vitamin C.The Nufountain forumal has NO oil and when you put it on your skin, it feels like drops of water and it does not spread nearly as well as the Obagi stuff. It spreads on your skin just as water would. BUT I think that is why this serum works so well. Your skin immediately aborbs it. You may have to put more drops just to get it to cover enough of your skin, however.When I first applied it, I was VERY dissapointed because it was soo thin and watery and I was use to my thick oily Obagi serum. So I had only used Nufountain a few times because I didn't FEEL like it was working. But I was looking in the mirror this morning, and my skin out of nowhere just looked soo nice, smooth and bright. And the only thing that changed in my regimen was this Nufountain serum, so I'm under the impression that it works.Bottom line is, I like this stuff. I was not even willing to give it a chance after a few applications, and it proved me wrong!",5
"Ladies/FriendsThis is best thing since SPANX.  I decided to learn how to apply gel nails myself and order gel polish and a gel lamp.  The lamp was defective, so now I had to send it back which means a delay in this project.  But I tried this OPI Bond Aid since hearing about it on the internet with just regular nail polish.  Well this is now the 5th day and there is no chipping or peeling.  I did also apply Sally Hansen Mega Shine and this also helps (apply the following day manicure).  I even washied dishes and still it looks good.  If you are one of those people who have reactions to acetone and so can't have acrylic or gel nails applied.  This product will help.  PS make sure you pick a superior nail polish or nail lacquer, that also helps.  I will still wait for the lamp to do gel nails, but at least I have options if I don't want to do gel nails.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  If you are a DIY person, then take the plunge.  Best wishes.",5
"Since I have very baby fine and fly away hair, I am always searching for a product that will make my hair look thicker and keep in place ALL day. This Suave does just that. And it does not make my hair stiff or un-natural looking.Note: All is takes is a dime sized amount on your fingers if you have baby fine or thin hair. For me, the first time I used it I placed a quarter sized squirt and it was WAY too much.So the next time that I used it, I use squirted out a dime size on my hand, blended it into my hair and perfect! My hair looked shiner, and best of all thicker and lasted ALL DAY!Bonus thing I like is that it has a clean smell and not overly perfumed. My scalp is sensitive to heavy perfumed products and it will break out in a rash and also itch. No itching or breaking out with this.Highly recommend this product! It is the best styling product I have ever used.",5
"Love this moisturizer with SPF 30, gives a rosy glow! Think it's especially effective if layered over the Murad's 'Active Radiance Serum'.  No longer need the heavy foundation & powder, just concealer, a real bonus!!!. Will purchase the full size for sure as I originally bought the sample kit.",5
"FORMULA: milky, lathers easily, gentle, leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dry/tight.I'm admittedly lazy about washing my face at night--I don't like using a makeup remover AND using a separate cleanser afterwards--that's why I don't like cleansers that can't be used around the eyes.This cleanser removes all my makeup without having to scrub hard, and I wear waterproof eyeliners. One of the best aspects about this cleanser is that it doesn't sting my eyes at all. It's gentle on skin and doesn't dry it out afterwards--which is saying a lot for me, as I have sensitive dry skin. I can't think of a single bad thing about it, it's my new 'holy grail' cleanser :).",5
"This was the first Astrigent that I have purchased from Thayer and I must say its my fave, I really really like it and the peachy smell is light and settle but u can still smell and enjoy it. Lovin it.",5
"I bought this brush being very skeptical about it being as good as it seemed to be. I have thick, very long hair that tangles so easily. I used to have screaming and crying matches with my mom when trying to brush my hair as a kid - now that I'm 25, I just have screaming and crying matches with myself while trying to brush my hair. While this brush looks nearly identical to my Conair hair brush - it is SO. MUCH. BETTER. It went through my hair like a hot knife through butter, and it was pretty painless too! I have yet to try it wet, but I can only imagine it will impress me then, too. I highly recommend to anybody looking for a great detangling brush. And mothers - buy this for your daughters - you will both enjoy it!",5
"I really gave this stuff a full try.  I used it as directed every day for a week and I gotta say, I'm not impressed.  I didn't notice anything at all with the first application, and nothing dramatic after 5 days.It has a very light sweet perfume scent, nothing strong, so on the plus side, it probably would not compete with perfume.  The real downside, however, was that it was not as moisturizing or smoothing as my current body lotion (&#34;Amazing Grace&#34; by Philosophy - makes my skin really smooth and moisturized all day long, and since I don't wear perfume, I love the smell).",2
"If you have a lot of problems with organizing your nail polish collection, then this would be perfect for you. It helps you keep it, well organized haha, obviously. It's an awesome price, too.",5
"This dry shampoo has an extremely strong and unpleasant odor to me and it doesn't really fade much after it dries. Hours later I'm still getting whiffs of it and quite frankly, it's so bad I sort of feel nauseated by it to the point where I needed to go wash my hair. I prefer the Batiste brand. It works just as well and there are many scents to choose from.This did work for me. I sprayed it on, scrunched and arranged my hair to suit me then waited until it dried and sprayed just a small amount of hair spray and I was ready to go. I just wish the scent didn't disagree with me so much.",2
"I have a large round boarshead bristle brush that I've used for years and love.  Purchased in a beauty supply store, for about the same price as this brush, it's been a workhorse for me.I was encouraged to try this brush by the promise of faster drying times. While this did indeed allow my hair to dry faster due to the vents, I also found that it tangled much easier than my old brush.  I have a shoulder length Sassoon type bob and need the brush to tame my frizzy hair into straight curves. This brush is a great size for that and the same size as my previous brush.Some things to note: this is lightweight and does have a bit of a plastic feeling.  For a $11 or so brush, that was surprising to me. I really liked the heft and feel of my previous brush better.  But the drying time is such a factor that I will definitely continue to use this brush on wet hair.  On dry hair, that it tangles easily and doesn't feel as comfortable, I'll continue to use my old brush.",3
"I used this today on someone's hair. Her hair had been breaking and shedding alot for the past month. I used the Huetiful Steamer for 15 min on her hair with this conditioner. I followed up with the Silicon Pearl LeaveIn and a little Almond Oil. Her hair became soft. Man, this stuff makes your hair smell good too. It looked really fluffy after, and the breakage and shedding was less. She is African (American African) and has natural African hair.",5
"This is one of the best help for my lashes. My eyebrows do not need as much help but my lashes looked very dry and short (like I had cut them, but I had not.) After using the Godefroy Double Lash, my eyelashes are really longer, fuller, and shiny. They look very good when I wear mascara. I gifted one of these to my friend who has longer lashes than I do, and she also said this product helped her lashes. I will buy it again. Also, It really does last long, since so little has to be used.",5
"This mask offers good moisture, which is what I am expecting. However, the scent was not pleasant to me. it's like some bitter chinese herb. I know this might be due to the Natto, and I understand that this scent is far better than those artificial parfume which is widely used in cosmetics. I'm trying to like it~",4
"These brushes blow my mind. They come in a nice package, they are super soft, and best of all the price ladies and gents! Can't go wrong",5
"I wanted to like this conditioner (and its matching shampoo-see my other review) because I love other coconut sulfate/ silicone free hair products and was hoping to get these delivered to my door instead of having to go to the store.This is the worst conditioner I have ever used.  It is worse than using nothing after shampooing my thick, fine curly hair and that is saying a lot if you have curly hair. I tried using this and its shampoo for two weeks before I quit and went gratefully to a brand I knew would fix the frizzy  horrible mess. Yikes. Plus it didn't smell much like coconut. It had a weird smell faintly of coconuts and rubber.My hair was so dry, weirdly textured & not soft... It sucked after using these products. I went back to my old organic brand that was sulfate silicone free and was instantly better, thank God.",1
I really love this product after having 3 baby's you need a cream like this . You will notice the difference,5
"This stuff works, the end.  Stop spending money on other products like I did.  If I had found this sooner, I would have saved so much wasted money on other things.",5
"I love this it smells good and it makes my hair soft.  I have to use more product than the more expensive stuff but, still it's good!",5
Love that it is 100% natural and gluten free. I live in Florida so any help with signs of aging from the sun is welcomed. Nice that the dose is only 1 per day. Full 30 day supply for a great price.,5
I love black polish in the summer time. I love it in the fall. I love it in the winter. I love it in the spring! This is a very nice black. Not goopy!,5
"This is my first time using a Neutrogena product and it did not disappoint. The moisturizer works great to keep your skin healthy during these north eastern winters. Also, the scent it pleasant and not too strong. This is a great product for its price.",4
I love putting on finishing powder but this product has to much sparkle  I feel like im weaing glitter jenna R.,2
"I am thrilled. It looks like the era of the sticky sun screen is over and I could not be happier. We are a very fair family living at a high altitude. We use tons of sunscreen. The Banana Boat sport coolzone sunscreen is a perfect choice. It goes on like a very nice lotion. It is not tacky or sticky at all.I was surprised that is did actually feel cool and refreshing to put on. In fact, this is one of the high points of this sunscreen. That cooling sensation makes it easy to remember to reapply. My kids reapplied it all day without being reminded because it felt nice.This worked beautifully in wind, water, and dirt. We have had no burning. It is easy to wash off with soap.",5
"I liked this gel but it was really, really runny. It seemed to go very quickly because of that. But it did make my curls more pronounced.",4
"I have a rather old Clairsonic, and I worried that these brush heads wouldn't fit properly but...they fit just fine and work great. They also didn't take as long as I feared to ship and each came in its own cute little white box. I was overdue for a brush head change and my skin is very happy for clean, firm new bristles. Will definitely purchase again.",5
"I have used my Adovia Dead Sea products and I absolutely love them. The serum works well and gives you an instant lift. I used this particular product everyday for 3 weeks and noticed fine lines and wrinkles fade tremendously. This serum delivers a good dose of Vitamin C to your skin giving a boost of brightness with antioxidants and added skin protection. Using this product will help you achieve beautiful results that will last and ones you will be proud to show off. I love the Adovia beauty line, it's one of my very favorites for dead sea products.",5
"After a few months of testing the brushes out, I found that the face brushes (powder, angled & large foundation) started shedding when cleaning. The other smaller brushes have not had this problem yet.  This set has a mix of natural & synthetic brushes. Eyeshadow lovers, be warned there are no real blending brushes in this kit, although I suppose the large pencil one can blend the crease decently.",3
I usually hunt for a concealer that actually conceals for my skin tone. So after some youtube stalking trying to find a chick that matched my complexion I was showed this little gem. If you use Mac N45 or Mac studio fix C6 you might wanna throw this in your makeup bag as a reasonable backup.,4
"After reading the excellent reviews I had to try this product for myself. As said this product is amazing and I am happy with the results. My zits are gone and my acne is disappearing right before my eyes. I used to always get zits alot especially when I wear makeup and none of the acne and zit products/medications ever worked for me, but after using this product I have not seen a zit in sight and the ones I felt coming in have disappeared and my acne is going away as well. This is an amazing product and guaranteed you won't be disappointed. I have yet to miss a day putting this suff on and i putit on at least 2-3 times a day. Also to the smell is amazing! Smells like watermelon, or at least mines do anyways. When I start to run out I will most definitely  come back and order some more.",5
"I bought this in an effort to buy only ethical beauty products. It is worth it. I have tried other vegan or at least ""not tested on animals"" mascaras, and they were clumpy and performed poorly. This one goes on clump-free and lengthens my eyelashes (it doesn't thicken them, but my eyelashes are just right). The black color is not too harsh (I had found that when buying drugstore mascara, the ""very black"" ones were too dark; I always had to buy ""soft black""--this is equivalent). My coloring is fair skin, green eyes, and either dark reddish brown or deep red hair (my natural hair color, not that I've seen in in twenty years, is something like dark ash blonde, but my eyelashes aren't light). Worth the money.",5
"We cloth diaper our baby and have since birth. We were intrigued by the G-Diaper because it decomposed so quickly. We use these when we travel, or when we are expecting an extra messy diaper. They work great and we have rarely had leaks. The actual G-Diaper pant is very soft and the leg elastic won't leave red marks on your baby's legs.Personally we don't flush the diapers, but have occasionally and they do flush completely. I just worry about overloading our plumbing.I could also see a disposable diaper user being able to make the switch to the G-Diapers very easily. They are very little hassle.",5
"This is one of my few constants in life ---that this product will ALWAYS work, it never changes, no matter how many years has gone by!I have been using this for years and am amazed at how well this setting powder  works---as long as you follow the directions!!!Frankly - I do go a little outside the box at times and use this with other foundations and cover products.  It still  it works a treat!  Of course I feel a tad guilty by not always using the Derma-Blend foundation and quickly go right back to it.Follow the directions and you will quickly find that this is not cakey, not overly drying (you must remember just why you are using this product) and will help cover nearly every kind of mark, veins, scar, tattoo etc.It will keep everything water-proof so if you cry with it being used on your face or get your legs wet  while using this to cover spider veins or whatever - while it will not bear up to a harsh and hot shower, it  will be no problem for quick dashes in the rain or a dip in the pool.I have dry eye -which means it constantly looks as if I am having a good cry -all my tears all day long, does nothing to dislodge my Derma-Blend until I takeit off just before bed!",5
"I use facial wipes every day and have tried every brand out there.  I tried these Cetaphil wipes and really like them, I like the way they seem to really clean your face and not just wipe the surface makeup off.  When I use these I can feel the tingling on my face and it feels really clean.  With other wipes I sometimes have to use 3 or 4 and with these Cetaphil wipes, one did the trick.  I would recommend these and will buy them again.  These are also great for travel.",5
"In order to keep my skin from drying out, especially during the winter months, I generously apply a lotion all over my body and face after taking a shower.  I hate walking into the health and beauty section of my local grocery or department store and selecting a bottle of lotion that has lots of dainty flowers and other feminine designs on it.  Also, the lotion itself can have a strong, flowery smell that can be quite annoying.  I sing in my church choir and our director warns us not to wear powerful scents because some of the members have allergies.Lately, I have been using Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh [Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh 20.3oz (Pack of 3)], because it contains aloe that heals and rejuvenates the skin.  It also has a pleasant cucumber smell that quickly dissipates.  Its green bottle, printed with a few leaves from the Aloe vera plant, is about as unisexual a design as you can find.  Thankfully, there is the Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion.  It works just as well as the Vaseline Aloe Fresh.  Its white, creamy lotion has a slight scent that is not flowery or cloying.  I've been using it for nearly two weeks and I haven't experienced any allergic reactions such as a rash that burns or itches.  The bottle itself is almost solid black, giving it a masculine appearance.  It is also ergonomically designed for easy gripping.Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is easily absorbed into my skin and doesn't leave it feeling slick or greasy.  Because it is produced by Vaseline, I feared that it would.  Vaseline Men is one of the best lotions I have ever used.  Because it is designed for men, I highly recommend it for men who have dry skin.  My parents came to visit me for Easter.  During their stay, Dad sampled my Vaseline Men.  It wasn't until he returned home and began using his regular lotion that he realized how much he missed the Vaseline Men.  He called me, asking where he could buy it.  I told him to order it from Amazon and pay for it with his Discover Cashback Bonus.Joseph B. Hoyos",5

Gelish foundation and top it off work well with all brands of UV gel polishes that I've tried. The foundation adds strength to my otherwise thin and weak nails and top it off gives a smooth shiny finish that lasts up to 3 weeks. These are the top two items on my manicure must have list.,5
I use this every night after i wash my face and before i put on my moisturizer ... i like it because it natural and its not harsh like some toners i love witch hazel toner and will def be buying this again Im a first time user of this i usally buy other toners but i love this one and will be sticking to this,5
"Crecepelo Tratamiento Fitoterapeutico Natural Phitoterapeutic Treatment is in my top three best dominican hair treatments. I really do luv  Crecepelo hair care line. Its all over u tube for the best and most favorite Dominican hair care product available. I know Silicon Mix is the most popular Dominican hair treatment on the market. Where ever I go to  purchase Silicon Mix, there is always Crecepelo right next to it. Some people prefer it over Silicon mix. It makes the hair grow a lot faster than other treatments. Your hair stops breaking off and is silky, and soft to the touch. It stimulates the scalp to produce speedy hair growth. While your hair is growing, it protects your hair from being damaged. If your hair is overly dry-damaged, breaking, unmanageable and takes forever to grow, Crecepelo is the right Dominican hair treatment for you. I only purchase the largest size. I use plenty of it on my now.... fast growing, thick, long past the middle of my back, hair.This treatment I can""t live without. For best results, use the shampoo, treatment, rinse, leave-in. The entire line is the best way to go. Purchase the largest size for best value. As soon as you start using it, others will want to tap into your supply, so, stock -up.",5
"I like the thickness of this brush for top coat of mascara. I use a smaller, more concentrated brush for my base layers to make sure I avoid clumping and apply even coverage throughout my lashes. I always finish off my look with a coat of Revlon Grow Luscious mascara, adds great length for a polished look",4
I didn't care for this.  It doesn't make your skin break out but it really didn't work for wrinkles.  Spend your money on something better.,2
"I'd been wanting to try Sleek for ages after seeing all the YouTubers hype it.  I was shocked to see it offered by Amazon but then again, I should have know trusty old Amazon was on top of things.  Anyway, this eyeshadow is suberb.  Very pigmented with a smooth formula.  I've got to try the other pallets now.",5
We use allot of AXE goods around here because they usually work well and is fairly priced. This is works as expected it is not heavy or sticky and greasy it goes on easily and last several hours it holds things in place and isn't super shiny...it's a good product.,4
"I have damaged hair, on purpose. I have abused my hair for years by dyeing it and using hair dryers, straighteners, curlers, crimpers and massive amounts of products in it. This Shampoo really does what it says and my hair feels so much more healthier using it. It smells so amazing as well, which is important!",5
"I found this particular brand of soap to be very strong for my sensitive skin.  I wanted to love this brand of soap.  It smells awesome! Therefore, I gave it to a friend and they love it.",3
"I've been using the rose toner for much longer time, and after trying this one out, I decided to go back to the rose one because it suits my skin better. I have combination to oily skin, and the rose one is soothing and balancing. I just didn't feel the same with this one.",3
"This came pretty quick. I got the exact color that I ordered. Wore it a few times already. attaches nicely to my hair. you couldn't tell I was wearing these extensions, looked like my real hair. i'm happy about my purchase. I might buy another one to give myself more volume.",5
"Kit means a little vibrating face massager, battery, and pads with acne medicine on them. As a face cleaner and massager it is 5 stars. You can twist the bottom off kind of easy, so keep an eye on it when you turn it on and off. I guess I was expecting something a little more elaborate when I saw the name blackhead eraser. My face feels fine and the gismo is easy to use. However, my complexion is not that bad and I don't really notice a difference.",3
"This curler never gets hot enough to actually curl eyelashes. It's working, the color indicator changes and if you take off the curling wand, the heating element is hot. But it just isn't enough heat to make a difference through the plastic curling wand.Also, the instructions are contradictory. The box says for best results to use the curler after applying mascara, but the inside paper directions clearly state that for best results to use it before applying mascara. I suppose both can be ""best"" when neither works, but I don't think that was what they were going for.",1
THESE NYX BUTTER GLOSSES ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !! THEY ARE SO PIGMETNED AND SMEEL REALLY GOOD. GREAT OVERTOP ANY LIPSTICK AND SUPER SHINY !!!!I ACTUALLY DO YOUTUBE MAKEUP VIDS (kimkreations p) AND I LITERALLY USE ADLEAST ONE OF THESE EACH TIME ! I HAVE THEM IN ALL THE COLORS !!,5
"i started using this about 1 yr ago and like it.  i am 52 yrs old, am italian so do not have dry skin.  it absorbs well.  it does have a slight smell to me but it goes away within minutes.  i use it on all my wrinkles before my face and eye creams.",5
"It's different than the exfoliant that I normally use because it's more like a mask, since it's left on the skin for about 15 minutes.  I have no complaints.",4
"My hair is short, regularly coloured and I use shampoo and conditioners specificly for coloured hair.The first time I used this I didn't use a conditioner and towel dried my hair, to be able to see the effectiveness of this product.Works up into good lather (we have very hard water) and rinses quickly.After being towelled dry, my hair felt clean with no residue and with a light lift in volume.This was impressive given the heat and humidity of Texas in the summer.Smells nice, very light scent but use a small amount as a little goes a long way.A clean light fragrance after dry, feels clean and light with no residue, a good product.",4
I started taking this Biotin a few days ago. I originally wanted it in hopes that it would strengthen my hair and nails. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it also helps with weight loss. I love the fact that it is a vegan product and aligns with my vegetarian lifestyle. I am looking forward to seeing stronger nails and hair and healthier skin. Great product and a great price!,5
"Overall, I like this product.  It does a good job at moisturizing my hands which are chronically dry during the winter.  However, no matter how much I rub it in, I am always left with an oily residue...Often I have to wash my hands after I use this lotion just to get rid of the oiliness.The only time when I do not experience this residue is if I apply the lotion immediately after showering or bathing.  Otherwise, it just never seems to absorb fully into my skin.",4
"First impression: Oh, I am jumping with joy at how adorable the box that this curler came in! I would definitely give this out as a gift based on how adorable the darn box is. It is little things like this that impress me. The first impression would make me stop and look if this were in stores. Inside the box was a card explaining to leave feedback or contact them with issues and the beauty eyelash curler with a pretty red handle. (I was even more excited to see the red handle, being that it is my favorite color)Before: My eyelashes are very long and they naturally curl a bit. However, I was looking forward to reviewing this eyelash curler because I did not own one and I had not used one in years. I wanted a little extra curl to make my lashes stand out a bit more.After: My lashes were definitely more bold after using the Bella and Bear lash curler. It was easy to use, I used it after my base mascara had dried. I did not even need to warm it up. It worked just fine. Below you will see a picture of my eyes after using the eyelash curler.See my Full Review Here: [...]I must let you know, I was NOT paid to write this review, but I did receive the eyelash curler at no cost from Bella and Bear to me for giving my true and HONEST opinion.",5
"I've never dropped my eyelash curler, I've never done anything harsh with it (even though it has been pretty harsh with me -- pinching my eyelids pretty often and all that good stuff), and yet today one of the cheap plastic handles broke in my hands.Honestly? I wasn't surprised that it did; this eyelash curler felt cheap and like its lifespan shouldn't be too long from the moment I got it.Honestly, it might curl your lashes, but for $15, I'm sorry, but I would just recommend that you'd get yourself something a little less flimsy.P.S: I see here that the company pretty much answers everybody, and so you'd probably answer me, trying to make this review go away, or to make yourself look better. Let me make this clear, please: I am not trying to slam you, I am being honest, and this is what I've felt. If you guys are looking to change anything, I'd recommend working on the flimsy plastic material the handles are made of, as thinking back, that was my number one turnoff. This feels like a toy, and it also acts as a toy. ""My first eyelash curler"" would have been a more suiting name.I'd also work on the spacing for the little cushions, because those keep popping out. Once again, I'm just being honest and trying to help you and honest shoppers, like myself.**Update: June 6th, 2014**The company contacted me, they've apologized and sent me a new eyelash curler, telling me the original product must have been defective.After using the new product for a little bit, I couldn't take it anymore, my lashes couldn't take it anymore, and I went back to using ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS THING, and it was better.All in all, this product would pinch your lids, no matter what, and would leave you with straight, uncurled lashes. Using any ol' curler, exactly the same way -- creates beautiful curled lashes that would last me days.I'm sorry, Whiplash, but with all due respect, this is just.. Bad.",1
"Love this brand of top coat, it dries your nail in 1/10 of the time, gives it a shiny glossy coat and smooths out the imperfection. I get comments asking if I have gel nails on. With 2-3 coats of this baby, my manicure last a week.",5
I do my own nails and Harmony Brand is consistently excellent. I will continue to order their products. The colors are wonderful as well,5
"It's suprising that one can use powder as an eyeliner, but this stuff works great! I have gotten many compliments on the product even though it is subtle (or can be dramatic too). This is the way eyelining was meant to be!",5
"the price maybe its good, but, it needs a lot of time to dry.its good for beginners. lol lol",2
"I have mixed feelings about this oil.  First of all, only been using it for 2 weeks so jury's still out on whether this will effectively boost my hair growth. I have afro-textured hair (3c/4a) and am growing it out naturally with a goal of waist-length hair in the next 3 years.  I'll be looking to see if I can get more than the 1/2 inch of new hair growth each month.  If I do, this will be added to my arsenal of highly-prized oils.  I must say I'm not happy with the smell in general which is why I've given it only 4 stars.  It's not offensive, but it does make me a little concerned since I work in an office.  So far I've been applying this to my scalp at night and washing it out in the morning so it hasn't been a huge issue.  I am interested in seeing what happens in 90 degree weather when the humidity is 100 percent.  I love that it seems to calm my itchy scalp and doesn't clog my pores.  I use coconut oil regularly so I know how quickly it can melt from a solid state.  However, the Brahmi oil doesn't stay solid for more than a few minutes once I start dipping my finger in it.  It liquifies quickly so something to be aware of.  Other than the scent, I really love the performance of this product.  So I would definitely recommend it. The fact that it seems to sell out so quickly should tell you something.  I won't let this run out before I order more.",4
"I am not a huge fan of Suave shampoos and conditioners, but this product works very well. It is a thick, nice smelling deep conditioner that left my hair shiny and soft. I have very thick hair that can be difficult to comb through. My hair is also a little on the dry side and this helped to moisturize it pretty well. I use it every other day, alternating it with my regular conditioner. Though the product boasts argan oil, the ingredient is pretty low on the list. This product contains a fair amount of petrolatum and mineral oil, which may weigh thinner hair types down.",4
"You can best describe my skin as ""congested."" I have acne every once in a while (mostly stress-related) and my skin is bumpy with congestion, especially on my chin and forehead.I think I've read every online review there is of this product! Since it's so expensive, I wanted to be sure. I'm a skincare junkie so I know my products. This is the best skincare product I have!I've been using the Clarisonic for a month now. Within the first week, I noticed my skin had a smoother feel to it. I could run my hand over it and not feel as many bumps or dry patches. Over the next few weeks, I had less congestion and acne (despite the stress!). I also have fair skin, which means it turns red with even the slightest bit of pressure. After each use, it is a bit red, but it doesn't last long. The way the brush works allows it to be highly effective while using a minimal amount of pressure.I use it twice a day with Bliss Clog-Dissolving Cleansing Milk. If you like your cleanser, then stick with it. The cleanser that comes with it is not good; it contains ingredients that will clog pores, which is disappointing considering the price of the Clarisonic package. I use the sensetive skin brush and use it as initially directed: 10 seconds on each cheek and 20 seconds on the forehead, nose and chin. I also use it on my neck where a lot of my congestion occurs. I'll mention that all the beeps and timers take some getting used to; I set mine to the 2-minute setting.My facial products (moisturizer, toner, makeup) all absorb much better, allowing me to use less of the product. My toner especially feels like it's being absorbed deeper into my skin.If you have acne, I would be very careful about how you use the brush, especially if you have pustular or cystic acne. You'd be essentially spreading the bacteria around on your face if you weren't using an antibacterial face wash. Just to be safe, I use a toner with a fair amount of alcohol in it, concentrating on any acne I might have. Washing the brush with a mild, antibacterial soap afterwards is also a good idea.I can't recommend this product enough! It has changed my skincare regimine forever! The price is high, but I don't spend as much money on facials or peels anymore. My esthetician doesn't have to do as much pore extraction either. She was the one who first told me about the Clarisonic and recommends it to her clients.Lastly, a lot of my (skeptical) friends wonder how good this is. The brush is made by the same people who made the Sonicare toothbrush. I also have a Sonicare toothbrush, and the sonic technology is what makes all the difference. This is NOT just gimmic. Five stars!!UPDATE 11/8/2011 :As much as I like this brush, I can't deny that using a brush on your face distributes bacteria around your face, plain and simple. If you're an acne sufferer, I'd highly recommend something else.",2
"Prior to getting this kit, I had an earlier version of the same basic product, which came with a two-speed version of the microdermabrasion tool, with the brush head and a full size tube of the exfoliating cleanser. I left the tool in my shower, and can confirm that it does well getting soaked in water every day, the batteries last a long time, and the tool is durable and reliable.I liked the brush and the cleanser, though it wasn't super-scrubby, like an ""exfoliator"" is, in my experience. Still, it cleaned well. My skin felt smooth and pleasant.New in this kit, is a *three* speed tool, with a foam pad and the ""Thermal Crystal Polisher."" Both the cleanser and the polisher come in small tubes.I'm not entirely thrilled with the polisher and the foam pad, though I can't tell if I'm just not using it right, or I expected something else. The substance is very thick and gummy, with fine, gritty particles. When used in combination with the foam pad, I feel a lot of drag on my skin, and it feels like it gets hot. I assume this is the ""thermal"" part, but... it kind of feels like heat just from friction, because it's dragging so much. And my skin doesn't seem noticeably smoother than when I just used the exfoliating cleanser and the brush.So, ultimately: it's a nice tool. It works well. I like the exfoliating cleanser and the brush. But the pad/polisher combo doesn't seem as nice. You might considerOlay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Countinstead, as it's a little cheaper. But you won't go wrong with this. :)",4
"Savanaah's Organic Argan Oil is a good product.  It goes on smoothly without leaving the skin feeling &#34;clammy&#34;.The dispenser provides just the right amount of oil. Since my hands dry out easily from washing them a &#34;guzillion&#34; times daily,I apply this product after each handwashing.  My hands feel  moisturized without being overwhelmed  by the oil.  Some other oils have a tendency to not provide a lasting effect. I like this one just fine.",4
"Ladies,This product has no exotic ingredient that warrants this kind of price. You can buy skin firming creams at Vitacost with DMAE the so called firming agent in this under twenty dollars! The second ingredient in this is glycolic acid which may brighten the neck skin by sloughing and turning over skins cells. You can also use a washcloth or salux to do so.Save your money.",1
"I purchased this product because I was looking for something with collagen in it because of all the claims that it would improve skin tone, etc. I use Yves Rocher products which are botanical but very expensive. After one week combined with store brand retinol cream my face looks visibly smoother and the deep lines around my eyes are visibly softened. I will be back for more of this product, since paying $18 each for Yves Rocher products is not my idea of a good value and I dont get the same results from this product from Personal Care!!!",4
"This is very thick- it reminds me of an oily Elmer's glue in consistency.We have medium texture, Caucasian, long wavy hair and the shampoo and conditioner have worked GREAT for us.  I thought I'd try this too - but it just didn't work out.I'm sure it might be nice on ethnic or biracial hair that is more coarse, especially if you  have a hairstyle that you need 'slicked back' or controlled.  In this way it reminds me of VO5 Hair dressing.  And, like that, a dab will do you!It says to use a dime.  DON'T.  Use much less than that and work your way up - it's very oily.  We have hair down to our waists here- male and female - and it just made our hair look greasy and oily and weighed ALL the wave out.  Plus it smells very strong.  It's a HEAVY, OILY moisturizer.But that might be PERFECT for some people.  I just thought I'd try it since the shampoo and conditioner have been so wonderful.  I'm hesitant to give it a bad review because I'm sure we are not target users of this product, but the SMELL of it gave us both headaches, so I just can't give it a higher mark.  Also, it's really nasty on your hands.  You have to wash and wash them to get the stuff off after you put it in your hair.",3
"I didn't care for this product, I didn't like the gel, and I did not see any improvement in my skin.",1
"The kids like this because it doesn't hurt their eyes. It works well in terms of cleaning, and we (parents) like it because the smell is nice. Definitely recommended!",4
"I have darker skin, and this made my skin feel smooth, improved my acne, and evened my skin tone. I highly recommend.",5
"First off: I have dry, sensitive skin. I also bike commute, so when I get to work in the warmer months, I like to freshen up a bit beforehand. In the summer, I have to wash off my sunscreen (Badger Broad Spectrum SPF 35 All-Season Face Stick, 1 stick,65 oz (18.4 g)-- which is sweat-and-water-resistant so it's also stubborn to wash off), as well as any sweat and dirt. I've tried a few other brands of face wipes, but I have to say, for summer, I like these the best.The texture of the wipe itself is soft and cloth-like, and they're not too damp like some other wipes so I don't feel like I'm wasting anything nor do I need to wait for my face to dry after use. They're just damp enough to do the job, though it helps if you wad the wipe a little, especially after making a few first passes. They get off my sunscreen and leave my face feeling clean and dry without feeling tight or sticky. I don't feel like I need to moisturize after using one because the cleanser is so gentle.In the winter I suspect they would be a little drying for me personally, but for now, these are a great wipe to toss in my bag for before work or after the gym. Will be buying again.",5
"I suppose I failed to notice a place where it said there mini exfoliating scrubbies in the soap. Acne-prone skin SHOULD NOT be scrubbed. My order was late with this seller but they completely compensated by sending me a ton of free stuff (so I don't blame the seller, they are great). After scraping up my skin, it began to sting and burn (I only had it on for about 15 seconds). When I got out of the shower, my skin was raw, red, and dry in odd places (like that area between my eyebrows...weird). I use adapalene and clyndamycin phosphate lotion and needed a nice, mild, herbal soap to gently cleanse my face before applying the stuff - well, this is NOT it.",1
"I ordered this for my daughter not knowing that I had purchase some previous, but that was fine. My daughter loved them anyway. I received them earlier than expected and there was no damage. Now my daughter has enough nails to practice and become an expert with applying stiletto nails. Thanks.",5
"Bought this for my mom, she loves it, most especially the foot scrub. I paired it with coupons to the spa and it made for a great gift.",5
"I bought this dispenser to hold cotton pads on my make up table, I got tired of taking bagged pads in and out of drawer twice a day.  This is the perfect solution.  It looks great on make up table and is functional as well.  You can remove pads without taking off top through wide opening and then turn dispenser around to hide opening.  I also bought Danielle square cotton ball holder to keep Qtips next to cotton pads.  They look great together and now everything is at my fingertips when needed.",5
The Facts:Heats fastNice size barrelMade wellGets really HotWorks like it should.The Problem:My Hair. I have thin frizzy hair- just not made for a curling iron- but I keep hoping that one will work for me. This one worked- but after a couple hours my hair looked flat and fried. not the best look on the planet.,3
"These are great disposable razors. They give a clean shave, and are very comfortable to use. The lubricant is not sticky or bothersome at all. It washes away quickly and cleanly and definitely is helpful in shaving. I would recommend these razors to others.",5
"Works great on oily skin. I would caution against using this product if your skin is extremely sensitive or dry. Lucky me, I have super oily skin and my skin is really thick and resilient. I use this to help with my facial redness from acne scars and my rolling and indented acne scars. It works really well, but KNOW YOUR TOLERANCE. I have been using peels for over a year and a half, and I started out with very low percentages and gradually worked my way up. When I first started using peels, I would get extreme peeling and flaking and it would look like my skin was cracked and burned. Now a days, I just get dryness and some mild flakiness. That's what happens when your skin becomes tolerant to the chemicals. I am very satisfied with this purchase and I have gotten several applications out of this bottle. It's kind of thick in consistency, like syrup, instead of the watery TCA type peels I am used to.",5
"I like Anastasia products in general, but find this one merely OK. The color is great, not too red and not too brown, but the powder doesn't really wear well, even with their brow gel. I probably wouldn't get it again, but would definitely try this color in a pencil.",3
"I was really pleased with this purchase, it works just like moroccanoil but at a much better price. I have fine blonde hair and this doesn't weigh it down at all! I put a tiny bit in my palms and run it over my wet hair after my shower and before combing. The bottle also lasts forever.",5
this gets everything out of your skin! my fiance even uses it!i rarely have break outs because i beat them to the punch. this thing is heaven sent!,5
"I live in an area with hard water, to be honest with you, I didn't have a lot of faith that this product would really lather well.It proved me wrong. I didn't have to use an abundance of it either. It lathered well, rinsed well, and I did not use a conditioner after, really wanting to give it &#34;the test&#34;. I really was pleased with it, my hair behaved, wasn't wispy or flyaway.The product itself has a yummy scent...anything with lemon is a favorite with me!  I would suggest this product to anyone.",5
"OPI DS Extravagance is a beautiful color! It very purple/berry/dark magenta. It has some very fine holographic glitter in it that makes it seem like the polish shines from within. In direct sunlight, there's a nice sparkle to it, but blue sparkle seems to be the most dominant; the contrast between the blue sparkle and the berry tone of the polish is beautiful! The formula was awesome on this and I got full opacity in two coats. It dries pretty fast, too, and with a top coat my manicure lasted nearly 10 days with very little tip wear, which is unheard of for me! I can barely get my manis to last a good five days. I don't know if the good wear is just with this particular polish or if that's a trend with all OPI polishes because this is the only OPI I own. But if the long lasting wear is true of most OPI polishes, I'm definitely stocking up on them. I highly recommend this polish!",5
"The reviews made me expect a little more. It has a very traditional sweet and spicy smell-- the kind women used to wear 30 years back. I think my mother would love it, but I belong to a different generation, and L'Origan reminds me of old closets and clothes smelling of old perfumes. It's not bad, but also not something Iwould  want to wear.",3
"I bought this product because it was incredibly cheap and well, I need a new foundation and wanted to see if this one was as good as my previous one. Before I put it on my face, I really liked it. It felt really creamy and it was a color that matched my ski tone pretty well. I put it on, and after a couple of hours, I was a greasy mess, I know this foundation is not for oily skin, but I am just warning other people with oily skin like mine that IThis is not the product for you.",2
"Don't notice any difference in outcome between this and my old dryer, but it's in an attractive color and easy to use.",3
"About 6 months or more ago, I stopped using shampoo.  (I'd heard good things from people who ""stopped washing their hair"", my hair is very fine and I wanted more texture, plus I'm moving away from all products with known carcinogens and other chemical ingredients.)Originally I used only baking soda and, it's true - the first 4 or so days created TONS of oil in your hair, but then it balances out and I was down to using just a pinch of baking soda in a bottle of water in my hair, every morning, to keep it from getting oily and removing what little product I use.  BUT, my hair seemed very dry and I read a blurb on someone's blog that said they found baking soda to be too drying, also, so they made their own shampoo with oils (similar to what's in this bar.)  I picked this bar up, on a whim, at my co-op and I fell in love, immediately.  My hair has been in fabulous condition and I was shocked to find that I could go a day or two without washing my hair before it would start to look oily and gross.  The ingredients in this bar shampoo don't scare me, they're all familiar, and it conditions my hair at the same time.  I'm sticking to it!",5

"I just don't see the volume. I mean, Yeah sure it's there, but it's slight. And I've been using about 4 pumps!I run it through my damp hair, root to tips after brushing it out. Sometimes I blowdry, sometimes airdry. Same results, maybe a little thicker with the hairdryer. I just don't understand why it's not working for me. I'll play around with it a little more, and hopefully I find the right amount, and perfect the whole application process thing. Maybe that's where the problem lies?",3

"Generally, I do not burn very easily.  I use the sunscreenspray SPF 30for cycling or hiking at sea level.  However, I do ski in the winter at altitudes up to 11,000 feet and climb mountains above 14,000 feet in the summer.  At these altitudes, where the UV radiation is more intense, I cover as much of my skin as I can, but I also use Banana Boat SPF 50 sunscreen.  I find that it does work for me. However, you do have to be careful with squeeze tubes when you go to a higher altitude or travel on an airplane.  The pressure in the tube becomes higher than the outside pressure. Just make sure that the cap is on tightly or the tube contents may squeeze itself out.P.S. This size tube is small enough that you can take it on an airplane.",5
"My wife has used chemicals in her hair for years and decided to go 'natural' a while back due to the damage that those chemicals caused. She was starting to get a bit discouraged about the condition of her hair due the lack of improvement. She complained about it thinning and breaking off. I did some research and found Pura d'or through a friend. My wife LOOOVVVEEESSS me! She has been raving about how strong her hair feels and how much more healthy it feels. And I will admit, I definitely have noticed a positive change since she began using the shampoo; mostly that it seems to shine more. I recommend this to anyone looking to strengthen their hair or repair damaged hair. I will definitely be getting more for my wife!",5
I've been using this color and purchasing it from Wal Mart for much more money.  I was very excited to find my regular hair color for 1/3 of the cost.,5
I like the candle too and the sampler is a good idea too. I just have to try them all.,5
Love this product. Just remember not to turn your hands or feet orange. It says see results within a week but I saw results the next day.,5
"I learned of this brush a couple months ago and i watched and read reviews before i decided to buy it. oh boy, did this brush do wonders. it gives me the best foundation application ever. i have used many different kinds of brushes that you can use for foundation and this one has done the best job. no streaking, no cakey look. just perfect blending and looks natural. i love this brush and i would definitely recommend it!",5
"I received this product from tomoson.com to try and As soon as I tested the shampoo, I like the fact its very concentrated and thick.

This shampoo has the best Minerals that help make hair stronger and nourished,specially help my scalp be Flacky free!",5

"Tresemme wins again! They've always had some of the best ""drugstore"" level products you can buy. This smells clean, fresh, and does the job on your hair you hope for without a salon price. Oh and p.s. ladies believe it or not you can use this to shave your legs and save on buying other products. (Just a tip lol)",5
"These are fantastic! They smell great, they remove your makeup completely and you don't need a sink to use them. I wish I had these back in my club days when I'd come home too tired to wash my face. A pack of these on my night stand would have been a welcome alternative to sleeping in makeup. Highly recommended!",5
"I love both the look and practicality of these brushes. They seem to be very high quality for the price. I have had no issues with the brushes shedding like I have with other brush sets I have bought. Good variety of brushes too. I agree with others that the case smells like paint, but I prefer that smell over mothballs like another set I bought in the past. I washed the brushes when I got them with vinegar and hand soap and no more smell.",5
Opaque in two coats and it's subtle silverly white tone with lots of shimmer.Not really impressive and I honestly don't know what to do with it.,4
"Acne!Sheez! I suffered from this embarrassing skin condition throughout my teenage years and thought it would never clear up. Miraculously, it did, although the battle left many scars, and I still have the occassional breakout. My skin isn't as oily as it once was, but it still needs more care than can be found in a bar of soap. Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask is pretty effective at sopping up the excess oil. Instead of using it as a wash, I'd recommend applying it to the face, leaving it on to dry, then washing if off. Afterward, my skin feels nice and smooth. It's dry, too, but not scaly.",4
AWESOME! I havent been able to use them all yet lol but they are great and you won't need lipgloss for a long time! there is literally every color I could ever need in this. they are beautiful colors and last a very long time. great product!,5
"I used both the shampoo and matching conditioner, they made my hair feel clean and soft. I had no problem combing through it and there was no residue feeling left on my hair after I rinsed it out. It also smells great. I will definitely buy this product again in the future. Try them both, they work well together.",4
It is a good shampoo for a hair without any treatment but it is not for my hair because I had Keratine and brazilian treatment in the past and I have very damaged hair. This product put my hair more dry. My husband is using it and it is very good for him.,3
I love the color and it lasted a very long time. With two application I was set for the evening,5
"I'm on my first pack and about 3 1/2 weeks in. What I have noticed so far is a reduction in shedding. I definitely started seeing less hair in brush and in the shower in the past week, so I'm gonna stick with it and order another pack",5
"I have been usingCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce, and I am very happy with it, so I bought this for my husband.  Since his hair has gotten thin as he has gotten older, he has developed a dry scalp problem.  He is very pleased with the results of this shampoo.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and it is reasonably priced.",5
this is a great product. its great for long hair short hair thin and thick. you just have to learn how to use it. people complain that its doesn't hold their hair but it does. and for such a low price i would buy it again,5
"Ladies, if you are a makeup person like I am, I eyeshadow is right on the dollar! FYI if you wet your brush and put it in the shadow it will darken a specific color/intensify that color (when you have a primer on over your lid). I love MAC but times are hard these days, and it's either the 30 shoes or the one color eyeshadow worth 25? I'll go with the shoes please. These colors remind me of MACs. If you are a make-up artist you can make any and all brands work and look as expensive as MAC. FASH has my vote!",5
"I picked up a $5 stamping kit at a local grocery store and I was having a really hard time with it. I watched endless videos on Youtube on stamping. When I received this one yesterday I was really surprised how easy it was. I used it with the white Konad nail polish - but also tried it on some paper with other brand nail polishes and it seemed to work great as well. I did not use the scraper cause of the reviews and instead used an old gift card. Some tips: Don't press to hard - I noticed if I press the stamp to hard onto the plate the image transfers crooked from the pressure. - Always check the stamp before stamping it onto your nail to make sure the whole image has transferred. And always clean the stamp, image plate, and scraper after each use with Acetone nail polish remover (I use a Q-tip dipped in acetone. I did butterfly's (uploaded an image) and I used the small side of the stamp! It worked perfectly. I am recommending this to all my friends! PLEASE: If you have problems watch videos on Youtube. There are some great ones out there that will help you to master the technique with a little practice. I am not a nail tech. I could not find anyone to do nice designs after we moved at the nail places in my area. I never did nails before like this. This was my FIRST time with Konard and if I can do it.... YOU can do it too!!! :D",5
"i'm trying different nail tips, and these are great, I am very pleased, you will not be disappointed if purchased,i don't remember where they came from, but they came pretty quick to me here in GA.",5
I've been using this now for about 4 months and as a black female this is one product that I did notice length and darker lashes.  As for my brows it does work but very very slow. slower than the lashes but just be patience and before you realize you will notice that your mascara on your lashes are looking longer and I've had people even ask me if my lashes were real.  That's the ultimate compliment.,5
"Excellent quality waterproof mascara that is build-able.  It doesn't clump or cause lashes to stick together. I have fine lashes and this mascara thickens and lengthens them. Easy to apply and it doesn't take but a couple of coats to see a real difference.  Makes the lashes look natural, instead of looking like caked on mascara.  I tried fake lashes that were applied at a salon....hated 'em.  Felt like heavy hoods on my eyelids.  This mascara is an excellent alternative to salon lashes.This mascara will give fuller thicker lashes with a formula that doesn't flake and will stay on, until taken off;  Feels light and non irritating.  Easily removed with oil or makeup remover. Waterproof formula is great for hot weather, and those who like to apply a little makeup when going to the gym. You won't sweat this off.  Not sure how well it would hold up for swimming. I am a swimmer, but don't bother with mascara when I'm in the pool.",5
"I have worn many different fragrances in the past...from your department store brands to Chanel... but none has gathered the number of compliments, especially from the guys as this bottle of magic.  I don't know exactly what it is, but this stuff is amazing and apparently works well with my body chemistry.  It's a great spring and summer fragrance but you need to put it on twice during the day to make it last.  I've decided to make this my signature fragrance and forget about the $60 a bottle stuff.",5
"I really like this product, it was as described and a perfect mint color. I really loved that the nail polish looked like the color in the picture. That really don't happen very often!",5
This mascara makes my lashes look full and long.  I am in my 30s and I do believe I've finally found the mascara for me.  I chose this particular mascara because of a YouTube review.,5
This product works..and its great on sensitive skin as well..I have extremely sensitive skin it gets irritated so easily with so many different products that say are natural and in reality they are just trying to make money..not with this product. .I'm definitely purchasing more before they sell out..and by the first time I tried it it clean my skin so perfectly. .it even removed my blackheads. .yay..so happy,5
"This is great for the eye area.  I think it is also good for the whole face, but that is just me.  It absorbs well and doesn't leave a sticky or greasy residue.  I will buy this product again.",5
"This is basically honey in a jar. That's the best way I can describe it. I put this on freshly washed hair, and then sat under the hood dryer. The next morning, my hair still wasn't dry. It left my hair a sticky mess. So I had to wash it out immediately. I am so happy I tried this product on a weekend rather than a day I had to go to work, because then I would have been SOL.People say that you should only put a tiny bit your hair, or that you should mix it with the smoothie, or the hair milk, but that's too troublesome to me. I want a product that I can just put on my hair and go, without worrying if I put too much or to little, or that I have to mix it with something else to work. Especially with the price. I have cheaper products that moisturize and style my hair on their own. I don't want to be a hair chemist to make my hair look nice. I want something that is quick and easy, and this is not it. This was just a huge pain for me.On the bright side. It's smell really nice as all Shea Moisture products do.",1
"To my mind this is the best mass-produced soap out there. (I also like Irish Spring but it leaves my skin feeling a lot drier than Dove). The soap is simple, smooth, smells good and is great for not leaving your skin feeling dry. If you're not buying some kind of doctor-prescribed sensitive soap or buying from a particular local seller or niche brand Dove is the way to go.",4
"I have a pretty dry scalp, and usually keep my hair buzzed short. I had decided to let it grow out, but stillit felt dry. This conditioner did make my scalp feel a little better, but I felt that it was very hard to rinse out (and my wife agrees). My hair is pretty thin, and if you have thick hair (like my wife) I think it is even harder to rinse out. The complaint my wife had was that she felt a film. I'm not much of a shampoo and conditioner expert....if it does the job, I'm pretty happy. If it smells good, I'm happier. The smell is good, and it seems to do the job....just with a filmy feeling. That doesn't bother me, as I am thinking that is what is helping my scalp. It did bother my wife, and she does not use it anymore. I noticed also, on my daughters hair as well. It really takes a long time to rinse it out and not feel the filmyness. If you don't mind that, then this is for you. I like it, and recommend you at least give it a try. You don't need much, btw, so for the price, this will last you a long time and I think is a good value.",4
I wish I could say I don't love vaseline but that's lie. I love it and my fave version is Aquaphor. I bought this hoping I could move away from vaseline but this just does not get the job done. I does an average job for the dryness I have on my face but it does not last and I find myself having to reapply often. I also feel it is making the area drier. Such a shame. Coconut oil alone seems to do a better job.,3
This is wonderful because it is natural and gives long lasting color...I love this stain for my cheeks. I used to use Benefit cheek stain in Cha cha and I love this one way more! Great purchase!,5
"I totally got sucked into the fun and gorgeous packaging of this product.  The colors are great and versatile, especially for office looks.  Since I have so many eye shadows, and in similar colors, I liked the amount of shadows in this palette.  It totally justified the purchase for me.",4
NIce brush. Easy to handle. Keeps my hair smooth without static. Even looks nice on the dresser. Has not lost any bristles and I have hair way past my waist to deal with. I brush my hair more frequently because I enjoy using it.,5
This is another good product by Clearasil. It does a great job of cleaning dirt and oil out of your pores. It really cleans your face andleaves it feeling very refreshed. It does dry your face out a little which is the only drawback.,4
"I really love the clean, fresh scent of this shampoo. The scent does not linger in my hair, but it makes the shampoo experience a little nicer. It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving residue, but it does leave it feeling a lot softer. The cap opens with an unusual push button. I didn't realize this the first time I used it in the shower and since I didn't have my glasses on, I ended up unscrewing the top to dispense it. If your vision is as bad as mine, check out the cap before you step in the shower. This is a shampoo that I would gladly buy in the future.",4
"I've been tanning irregularly for a couple years now, I go now and then and at one point I had good color, but then I stopped going often enough, this tanning lotion gave me a great even boost in color after just 1 session, and I assume after a few more sessions it'll have me dark in no time, I'm quite satisfied as it does take me awhile to tan, also it smells awesome from the descriptions that it was perfume-like concerned me, its really not, very fresh and clean smelling slightly citrusy",4
I love the discs but one was cut slightly off center so part of a design from another disc is on it's edge.,4
"I don't know why, but for some reason I was expecting the rods to be about as long as regular pencils.  They are the size of the pencils you use while golfing.  I got a bunch of different designs [not the same as pictured, but still really cool] and my little cousins loves when I do her nails with cupcakes or snowmen! They even come with a small razor to shave the rod",4
"The nice thing about this bodywash is that it's an all-in-one product combining bodywash, shampoo and conditioner.  So, I only need to carry this one bottle to the gym for my after workout shower.  It's a fresh smelling blue product that lathers well enough that it's not too much work to get a good soaping action going.  I don't have anything negative to say about this wash.  I didn't give it 5 stars just because it just doesn't seem to stand out quite enough to rate that.  Some washes are milder and some may have a fragrance that appeals to me a little more.  So, 4 stars seems right to me.  It's fine, but I may or may not buy it again.",4
"Very pretty colours.  Takes a little skill to apply.  If you choose to leave the tape on your nails, the colours tend to rub off.  As stencils, they are fine.",3
"Bundle Monster had a great set of plates before, and these are even BETTER!  Adding 4 more plates to the set, plus the improvements made to full-nail images, backings and more, these are an amazing product at an amazing price!  What a value!  And, with 25 plates full of ideas, the possibilities are nearly endless with these.  I'm so happy with them, and I use them all the time.  Even the older set is great!  I'm sold.",5
"i love this scent. it smells like vanilla but isn't super sweet, it's like the perfect combo of sweet and floral... i love it, i have the largest size and it's SO worth the price.. it used to be $90 a 3.4 bottle at sephora back in the day, but it's just so good, i wear it often... so worth it.",5
"This product exceeded my expectations.  I've actually used a fair number of products over the past five years once I could no longer find a facial wash I had been using for about 15 years.  They have all done a good job at cleansing, but all of them leave my skin dry to some extent.  This is the first facial wash I've used recently that doesn't absolutely require me to put on moisturizer after I wash my face, though I do tend to still use a bit of moisturizer with sunscreen added just to protect my skin from sun exposure.Another nice thing about this product is that it has little or no fragrance.  I generally prefer unscented bath/beauty products, and this one truly is neutral smelling.",5
"first few times you use this oil, you're going to feel cramps in places where you applied it. then as your body is no more deficient in magnesium, you won't feel anything. the only negative is in places where you put the oil on your skin, there will be film on it. so I'd recommend maybe using the oil at night and washing it off in the morning.",5
"This stuff feels like it has something abrasive in it. It kind of hurts to put it on. I have sensitive skin and this is not compatible. I prefer I'oreal Studio Effects Professional much more, which can still be found in drugstores I believe. It leaves my skin soft and I see a visible difference.",1
Good for healthy strong nails.,4
"This is a white, thick creme conditioner that smelled sweetly fragrant to me, and the smell does last - I noticed especially on the days that I put my hair up- when I took it down, it smelled just washed.It leaves my hair feeling extremely soft and silky, and quite shiny.  It did weigh my hair down a bit though - I lost a lot of my natural wave and volume.  Also, I found it a bit harder than usual to braid and style my hair, it seemed like it was just sliding all over the place, and didn't want to stay put.I do think though that it does moisturize hair well, and that really dry hair will benefit from it.  My hair at times does get really, really dry,  but right now, after using this and a few other products for damaged hair- it's starting to feel really nice.  I would just skip it if I knew I wanted to wear an elaborate updo the next day.",4
"Just like the soap.  This lotion has a fresh clean and sexy scent, my husband and I use it. It was very thick however and I had to mix unscented lotion to thin it out.",4
just the right stuff im a practicing make up artist its really nice good amount in the jar  not runy or thin or chalky gives a nice enough high light for marking out the eye brows,4
My skin feels so much better when I use it...it isn't runny like some can be such that they slide right off of your hand or get 'looser' in texture...I'm not much for the tropical smell [figured that out after the fact] but even with that I still love this product.,5
really made cheap...but works!,4
"Nice to keep in a gym bag, since it's a combination product and then they don't have to carry a separate conditioner. Does seem to help with dandruff, though if you have a serious dandruff problem, this isn't likely to be the solution. If you just have a little, it will probably do the trick.",4
"Brushes are the perfect size to fit into purse/backpack.  Handle is no longer than a mascara wand; so the bristles won't be damaged if carried in a small makeup bag that zips closed.  The angled brush is a lot larger than I expected.  If you're looking to apply a thin line of shadow over eyeliner, try adding another smaller bristle brush to this set.  Otherwise, it's everything needed for flawless application.",5
"My hair was so thin, you could easily see my scalp.  I decided that I could either choose pretty hats or scarves, or I could solve the problem, and for a crazy variety of prices.  On the side of this box, a drawing indicates who it will work for, and that it won't work for bald spots, however, I had one nickel-sized spot near my forehead that is no longer bare.  I suppose they didn't want returns from people who didn't have this positive effect.You will need to continue using any minoxidil product indefinitely, or all the new growth will fall out in a number of months, but at ~$22 (~$18 at Walmart) for a 3 month supply, I think it's well worth it. Minoxidil is the effective ingredient in all of the brands.  The prices quoted herein, I found online today (4/2014), and they are as follows:  ~$39 for the Walgreens generic; Pantene's version costs  ~$44 at Walgreens, and the Rogaine brand name at Walgreens will cost you ~$52 for 3 months.  Each generic or brand name has exactly the same chemical and strength (for the women's formula -- the men's formula has an extra strength minoxidil also), so the low cost Equate version is the only one that makes sense to me.  The choice for a three month supply comes down to the price you are willing to pay:  $18/$22, $44, or $52.  If the name on a bottle that no one but family will see is important to you, go ahead and spend more.  I'll stick with $18 at Walmart (and $22 this time because I couldn't get to Walmart).[NOTE:  Definition of a tilde, ""~"" -- in chemistry and math, it means ""approximately""]",5
Came I'm early and it looks like the sizes vary slightly ! Perfect for pedicures on my small toes ! Already used them and I've got some compliments ! Amazing,5
"I didn't realize this was for ethnic hair when I selected the product to review.  It left my hair heavy feeling and unpleasant smelling. I gave it to my daughter who said that it was ""really weird shampoo"".",1
I was not at that pleased with Covergirl Lashperfection Mascara. This was dried out and not able to use much of it. I have used this product before and I loved it.,2
"So I'm now officially in my ""mid 30's"", but I still have an unpleasant tendency toward a line of acne along my jawline. As I start worrying about wrinkles, I'm just fed up with the pimples.To keep things in perspective, I have never suffered from seriously bad, all-over-the-face acne. I do have fairly oily--but very sensitive!--skin with blackheads in some areas and usually just a few pimples at any given moment at the jaw.I mentioned the very sensitive nature of my skin... I've tried many over-the-counter facial products and a few from my doctor that caused me to break out in a rash. Added colors, scents, etc. are usually bad for me.The Acne.org products seem to be working very well for me. It has been about 10 days since I received this kit. I went with the small (2 oz) size because in the past I've wasted too much money on expensive products that give me a rash. I am probably not using as large a quantity of each product as the Acne.org ""regimin"" would demand, but I'm also not treating my whole face.The cleanser is great. It is clear and practically odorless. My face seems to get clean and I haven't noticed any irritation due to the cleanser. The closest OTC product I could compare it to is Cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, which was previously my ""best"" choice. I think this is at least equally good and a better value in the large size.The Benzoil Peroxide is 2.5%, it feels a little icky (itchy/burning sensation), but I think that's what it is supposed to feel like. I don't enjoy it, but I am already seeing an improvement and no new pimples since I started its use, so I'm tolerating the discomfort.The moisturizer is what I use the least. I rarely use any face creams because of the oily/sensitive nature of my skin. I am patting a little bit of the moisturizer on where I am feeling the irritation from the Benzoil Peroxide, and I don't think I'm reacting badly to the moisturizer (no new breakouts), so that's great. I'm also using it occasionally on the drier parts of my face (crows' feet zone) but never after applying the BP, since I'm afraid I'll accidentally drag that stuff near my eyes.I do believe I will order the large pump bottles of the cleanser and treatment (BP), at least. I might even get a big bottle of the moisturizer, though I find it impossible to imagine using up even 8 oz of face cream.",5
These stamping plates are great! Their is plenty of variety and the most important part they stamp wonderful. Images are a nice size for stamping your entire nail and they are very detailed. This set would make a great edition to any stampaholics collection.,5
"These are a great buy if you want to learn how to apply false lashes, they're very inexpensive and you can practice many times without feeling wasteful. My only complaints are that these lashes are synthetic looking, which is ok if you are wearing them as part of a costume but not for daily use. Also, they're not very curly which kind of defeats the purpose of fake lashes since they stick straight out and you can hardly tell they're there.",3
i purchased it from sallys beauty supply. My hair is naturally dark blonde but ive been bleaching it since im 15 which means 5 years of bleaching my hair.. i decided to do my hair half black ... it faded pretty fast and it just doesnt look good on me since im really white..bleachng wasnt really an option for me because my hair is that damaged ... so when i did it yesterday i put half of the bottles in a bowl and put it on the hair thats brown.. left it on for more than an our and it turned red really light brown but not what i needed so i decided to do it again .. didnt do anything ... but i gotta say my hair is 0 damaged (if my hair could be getting any worse ?lol) it made it feel pretty nice actually...im gonna go ahead today and still bleach my hair but with less developer (?) so instead of using 30 or 40 i will be using 25 and some bleach and afterwards a toner to get the blonde i want..it smells reall disgusting.. im not sensitive with smells but that even made me sick ..it was all over the house . the best thing is probably to do it in the summer outside.. and just wash it out outside...I did not use Number 3 ..the lotion but i used a hairmask instead (thats what they also told me in sallys)..I would recommend this product but dont expect a miracle to happen..,4
"Wear this everyday. My dermatologist actually told me to wear BareMinerals and I must say it's clean, feels nice on the face. Not a heavy makeup. I do use Lauren Hutton spot concealer but use mostly all BareMineral products.",5
I wash my face with this and really like it.  My son even uses this all over his body in the shower.  It cleans and leaves your skin feeling soft even before you put on your lotion.,5
"i ordered this to go with a Mystique costume for Halloween and it was perfect. nice color and didn't tangle or shed too much. It does take a while to arrive so as long as you plan for that then this is totally a great buy. I ordered a purple one for a friend as well and she loved it. This is not a natural looking red but it is very beautiful, good quality wig.",5
"it does make your hair waaaay softer!! but the thing is.. I ordered size (2 ounce) the first time & now I just received (6 oz) I noticed that the color is different..the 2 ounce looks more yellowy & the texture is a little bit thicker.. I wonder why... but other than that.. they both work just fine ..I have blonde bleached hair & every time I blow dry it ..it becomes very dry but using Chi silk makes it soft & shiny, Im so happy with it!",5
"I'm in love with the color of these brushes! so Bright! and the pouch it comes with is lovely! its amazing the brushes are so great. they have a brush for everything! high light foundation, shadows etc. High recommend if you like that hot red color and great quality brushes!",5
"although they did come quickly the container the bobby pins come in was not sealed! im a germ freak so i ran them under some boiling hot water and some soap to make sure they were clean. you never know. but i would have liked for them to be sealed, just for the piece of mind.",3
"I'd been having trouble sleeping and as a result was experiencing some puffiness and darkness around my eyes. I decided to give this ""Eye Whip"" a try because of its all-natural ingredients. For me it took a few days of twice-a-day applications to notice any difference, but after about a week the puffiness around my eyes had subsided greatly, and generally the skin in that area began to look a lot softer and brighter. After three weeks I've also noticed some reduction in under-eye darkness, too, though it hasn't gotten rid of it completely (I wasn't really expecting it to -- only concealer can do that). It's also nice because I only use a tiny dollop of cream for both eyes, so I think the can will go a long way. So that's all good.However, I have a few criticisms too. The first few times I applied the cream it felt kind of burn-y around my eyes; the sensation went away after a few days, but it was off-putting initially. Also, the cream's a bit greasy and takes a LOT of rubbing to work into my skin, even just a dollop: after the first week I stopped using it in the morning because it left my skin shiny for half of the day. It also definitely has a distinctive coffee/mocha smell -- I've grown to enjoy it, but I could see it being a bit strong for some people (the good news there is that there's an unscented version available from the seller's store, which is cool).Final verdict: Overall this is a good, rejuvenating eye cream, and the price is definitely right for the amount of product you receive.**UPDATE 1**I have now been using this eye cream for about two months, and I have to say, I've grown to like it more and more. The skin around my eyes has never been softer, and if I forget to put the cream on at night, I definitely notice it the next day because my eyes look a lot puffier and tired. There's still some darkness under my eyes, but overall it has definitely become less prominent. Thumbs way up!**UPDATE 2**Remember how I said a little of this stuff goes a long way? Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it. For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal! Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time. Daily use has made the skin around my eyes MUCH brighter and softer, and I have virtually no dark circles anymore despite hardly ever getting enough sleep. I have also started spreading a little cream on my forehead, which I think has improved the skin there, too. I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars. Seriously, give this stuff a try -- it's a great investment!",5
"This shampoo combined with the masque is all I will use. Even when I go to the salon, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner because it is sooooo much better than what they use! I've been using this product for a few years now and it still never disappoints.",5
"I like the smell of Dove products. This creamy, almost deliciously scented, shaving gel has the well known marks of the Dove brand. My only issue is that it seems to focus more on lathering than attaching itself to facial hair follicles for smoothing shaving.

my husband uses Floristor and it was recommended to him by his doctor's nurse for his digestion and elimination problems.  along with a change in eating habits (what he eats and when) has pretty much gotten back to normal.  he has been using this regular now for several months and is quite amazed at his quality of life now.,5

"After a stressful day of reading and writing reviews for Amazon books, couldn't wait to try these lavender bath salts in a hot bath.  They are sublime.  Heaven on earth...everything the other reviewers said, especially Martin's comment: ""better than drugs"". I never took drugs during the 70's, although did try the unfortunate hot pants fad. But back to the lavender.And yes, these salts remind me of a trip to Paris - loaned a guy at Starbucks a quarter and got a trip to Paris out of it - one time good deed didn't get punished! These lavender salts are like going to Paris, but without the kiss from the French waiter at Cafe De Flore that my husband never found out about.One benefit of these lavender salts I didn't anticipate is we have well water and said husband likes to NOT spend $$$ on a water softener, or trips to accompany his wife to Paris, obviously.  So, when you bathe, the well water feels kind of metallic - it's weird. Bathing in hard water feels to me like taking a bath in liquid aluminum foil. But pouring these fragrant, soft little beads of salts into the water just softened that hard water right up. You feel like you are lying in a warm, sun-kissed lavender scented field in France.  Who needs a French waiter?I have just rationalized that buying these bath salts on a regular basis is less expensive than softening all the water we use in the house. Or paying for a return trip to Paris. They are a sublime non-guilty pleasure to pamper yourself.* These salts were provided by San Francisco salt company in exchange for an honest review.",5
"This is my first time using a product from theBalm. I saw this product reviewed by a beauty blogger on YouTube and was intrigued enough to try it myself. What a GREAT kit! The eye shadows are deliciously creamy to the touch and include a nice variety of matte, shimmer and high sparkle shades. The variety in color palette is not as great, but that's okay, because what is there is most of what I wear, so it fits my needs.The fun factor is through the roof on this little palette. Eight of the 12 shadows have punny names based on rock bands: Metal-ica (sparkly silver), Iron Maid-in (sparkly gold), Lead Zeppelin (sparkly lead gray), Alice Copper (sparkly copper/purple), Blink 1982 (shimmery beige), The Stroke (shimmery midnight blue), rem (shimmery orchid) and Third Eye Blinded (shimmery pale pink). The other 4 shades are named after musical tempos: Adagio (matte pale beige), Allegro (matte  cafe au lait), Moderato (matte deep purple) and Presto (matte dark color that appears brown).There is also a blush (a pale peachy pink) and a highlighter (SUPER luminous beigey gold) and two lip colors that can also double as cheek colors (a cherry red and an almost nude pale pink). The kit also includes a heart-shaped mirror.I have seen a lot of bulky makeup palettes, but this one is super compact and I could definitely see travelling with it. The palette is magnetized at top and bottom so it securely closes and even has an outer sleeve you could use if you were travelling, to make sure everything stays put in transit. Really impressive packaging here!I have sensitive skin and most shadows (beyond the Almay hypoallergenic line) bother me. I haven't had a significant amount of trouble with these shadows burning or itching my eyelids. I do have some minor itching with the super sparkly shades, probably because the particles are larger, but it isn't enough to be a major issue and only bothers me when I wear the shadow for a long period.For the fragrance sensitive (as I am), I noticed no scent at all with the shadows. The lip products, however, ARE scented; they smell sort of like a bubblegummy lip balm or gloss. Really only noticeable if I put my nose right up to it.I recommend this palette especially for people who like to wear a bold eye and don't mind shimmery/sparkly shadow.",4
"I liked this face wash but then I started to breakout more than ever.  I have not broke out in acne in a long time I am 34 years old that is not normal.  I don't know if it is attributed to this wash but it is the only thing I have changed.  I don't notice a great deal of difference in my skin so I can't give it great stars, I want to see results not wonder ?is this working?",3
"This color is beautiful except it's a little lighter in person, but I was okay with it!",4
I have purchased irons for about $200 and they were not nearly as great as this one. I love that it has an off/on button and that you can control the heat.  It's well worth it!,5
"This is a decent eye makeup remover, but not the best in my opinion. Makeup is removed pretty easily but I don't know if its the product itself adding to eye dryness on my lids, or something else. This product is a convenient buy, and pretty gentle. Dries fast with no oily residue at all. This is my second or third time purchasing. Can be found at any drug store.",3
If you share your shower with a spouse and of course do not use the same products there isn't a cleaner looking way to unclutter the look.,5
"I like to use Sebastian Laminates Cellophane between hair coloring because is making my hair really shiny , soft and frizz free.",5
"Great face wash.  I have combination skin and have tried everything from Pro-Activ to Clinique.  But I started using this and my skin has never been better, exfoliating but still gentle enough to use everyday.",5
"It is a wonderful hair dryer. It is fast, light. I am very happy because I can dry my hair in half time that I did before with another brand. I recommend it 100%.",5
I like the Avon MagiX Face Perfector. It leaves my face feeling soft and makes me feel protected since it has SPF 15. The only thing is that it made my forehead break out.,4
"I brushed it with my fingers and a few chunks of hair fell off :( its kinda shiny but you could use baby powder to hide it. Another thing was that it got to my house a whole month after I bought it but that's ok since I didn't need it in a rush. Other than that, it looks pretty real~ and its soft too~ so I think it's good for its price.",3
"I have curly hair and even though I'm not the target audience (African American), I still use these products because they make my hair look so great.  It's hot and humid in my area so my hair is always trying to be wild and look like I don't brush it.  The directions on this say to put it on towel dried or dry hair and I've done both.  First of all, a little goes a LONG way.  I find it works better on towel dried hair.  It makes my hair feel silky and it looks really shiny and pretty.  If I use it on dry hair, just the tiniest bit is necessary because otherwise it will make my hair look greasy and unwashed.As for my girls (both have African American type hair), it makes their hair looks so shiny and healthy instead of dry.  They each have different hair types and it works equally well on both.  The smell is fresh and clean and I use the leftover on my hands to rub into my elbows and arms, gives them a nice glow.This is another product by Motions that I will be keeping in my hair care routine.  I've loved everything I've tried so far and can say that if you're caucasian with curly/frizzy hair, a lot of their stuff works really well for you too. If you're African American, you'll be really pleased with the results and the nice scent.",5
This is the first Pond's cleanser I have tried and I am pleased! It is easy to use and leaves my face feeling nice and smooth and fresh looking. I like that it has two steps in one (cleaning and exfoliating). It saves me time and money! When this runs out I will be buying it again!,4
"I am a 47 yr old African American woman who recently put a temporary color in my hair and unfortunately had an allergic reaction. My scalp was tingling and itching and I had headaches that would wake me out of my sleep. I did some research on the internet and found out the many woman have been experiencing allergic reactions to permanent and temporary hair coloring because they ALL contain some form of PPD's (paraphenylenediamine). It was very important that I remove as much of the color from my hair and scalp as possible. I shampooed my hair with Malibu Un Do Goo no less than 4 times and let it sit on my scalp for about 10 minutes just to make sure I was getting as much color removed as possible. Within 24 hours the tingling, itching and headaches didn't completely stop, but it was a significant difference. I'd advise that you use a good humectant (moisturizing) conditioner afterward because it left my hair dry and hard to comb thru. I recommended this product without reservation.",5
This conditionar works ok but it leaves my hair feeling dirty. It smells nice and i have tried to rinse it out more but it doesn't work. When I use it at night in the morning my hair feels and looks bad. I have to rewash it in the morning.,3
"generally, I don't see the point in buying a good base coat, it goes on the bottom, who cares, right? Well now that I've used GOOD base coat, noooooowwww I get the difference. ha. Do yourself a favor, make your life easier, and polishing less time consuming, and buy this stuff.",5
"Three stars because these are small. They are not what I would consider full size combs, and certainly not what I was expecting.",3
"I'm so jaded and skeptical about miracle beauty products, but this stuff leaves me speechless (well, almost).  Like another reviewer, I started with my eyebrows, and noticed a difference within a week. With advancing age, my lashes have become almost invisible, but about a week and a half after daily use, I SAW lashes.  ON ME!  After three weeks, my rabbity eyelashes are defined (with a little help from Lancme) and dare I say it, lush.  My eyebrows are fuller and I can even  feel the difference when I touch them.My lashes are naturally pale, and it's taken experimentation with various mascaras to make me a believer, but I'm telling you this stuff works!  I purchased mine through nomorerack and gulped a bit even at their deeply discounted price, but it proved to be a great investment.I went about my errands today sporting only mascara.  WOO-HOO!  People have been telling me I look great (not that I'm vain or anything) and I'm a customer of Lucalash for as long as I can get it  at a discount.",5
"I have normal hair, but it is dyed, and I love how the shampoo smells and makes my hair look and feel. Partnered with the Dead sea mud conditioner, my hair is stronger and is easier to style and manage. Highly recommend.",5
"This stuff is great for clearing up your skin and giving you a nice healthy glow. You don't need to use it every day as advertised. I actually found my face wreaking havoc when I tried to. To me, it's a nice product that should be used in moderation when you see fit.",5
"I used this product for the first time, and went strictly by the timing directions for the first eyebrow, it came out great looking, color was perfect.  Then when I was doing the second eyebrow, I for some unknown reason, decided to reapply the first eyebrow with more color and left it on, only about 30 more seconds, but what a mistake, now both are too dark.  I now know that the timing is everything, and even 20 seconds makes a big difference.  I know my brows will fade, they are already tolerable, so I love the product.  Works much better than the hair dye I was using to color the gray in them.  I suggest to anyone doing this for the first time to take the color off after the recommended time and only reapplying if they are way too light, and then only leave it on for seconds more.",5
"All natural, gentle (DOES NOT STING), very light fragrance goes away when dry, and it helps relieve acne. Couldn't get better than that!P.s. Walgreens purchase, June 2011, paid around $6 for the bottle. It goes a long way. I use cotton squares to apply it.",5
Great foundation that looks natural and is easy to blend. I use either my finger or the sponge that comes with the compact to layer on the right amount. The color also looks natural on my skin. This has got to be one of my favorite drugstore foundations.,5
"This is my first top coat I've tried. I like the shine it gives your nails. Also it dries quick! Ive used it ontop cheap polish & high end polish but it always peels within the first day or two, taking my polish with it. Im a stay at home mom so nothing major is being done using my hands. Everyone's nails are different, unfortunately this didn't work for me.",2
"First amazon had to deliver this twice bc I never got the first order. Second when I finally got it, I wish I never did. Its like chalk and doesn't even come off the pallet well anyways, dont buy.",1
I love that this is dual sided and one side has more of a lotion feel and the other a body butter for those days when a little more moisture is needed. It does take a minute to absorb into the skin so keep that in mind if you are looking for a rub in and go type lotion but for my dry skin the extra minute of absorption time is well worth the wait.,5
"I like this product. It is like a softer pomade with a more pleasant scent (has a similar texture to petroleum jelly) . I use it on my hair ends to hold my curls from an attack of the frizzies. Very little is needed to achieve this; too much produces oily head.The scent is tropical and nice and light. I think it will last a long time, 4 ounces will go a long way unless you have super dry hair. It has a mild hold which is perfect for curls that sometimes fall out when the weather changes, and is light enough to not feel like it has a stiffness to it.",5
"The GOOD:-Very gentle-Does not dry skin-Effectively prevents breakouts-Clean smell-Rinses off wellThe BAD:-Tough to find in my areaI've had problem skin since my early teens and have only recently gotten it under control. Proactive, Noxema, Clearasil... you name it, I've tried it. I had been using Cetaphil Daily Cleanser for the past year, but finally got sick of the medicinal smell and rising cost. After reading loads of reviews online, I found this J&J; Purpose Gentle Cleanser and have fallen in love with it. It's super gentle and doesn't dry out my skin, but removes loads of dirt and oil. A little cleanser goes a long way (I only use about half a pump per wash). My only complaint is that it's hard to find near my home. I've seen it in a few Krogers and Giant Eagles, but not where I live. I will continue to buy from Amazon until I find it in grocery stores. Love this stuff.Recommended: Yep",5
"Yes, it has boar bristles, but it also has plastic bristles (thus the price!).  On a blow out, the plastic bristles warp from the heat.  I have thick hair and sometimes it is hard to get through to my scalp.  I'm thinking I should have splurged for a more expensive, higher quality brush...",3
"I've tried products touted by serious hair gurus.  Never works for me.  This one does, like crazy.  Two dollops, not large ones.This product makes me grateful.  Finally, something works.  And it's got a pretty neutral fragrant.  I acknowledge it doesn't work for most others.",5
"I really liked the shampoo. It smells great, leaves my hair feeling good, and with my current conditioner (not Suave product), my hair always felt great. But then I decided to get this conditioner to use with the same brand/product shampoo and I was really disappointed. So I did like the smell, the bottle is easy to handle and is aesthetically pleasing, but it didn't do much for keeping my hair soft. In fact, I ended up having all sorts of tangles in my hair which were not easy to get out.I gave this three stars because I do like the smell and my hair is shiny, but I wish it would actually condition more than it did, especially since I'm using both the shampoo and the conditioner together.",3
"Too oily for my taste, I tried using very little at times also. Still not working for me. Boy does it break my skin out, I can't even put it on my face at all. But my hair- yeah too greasy.",2
"Pleasant smell, foams well, lubricates well.  All around happy with the product.  The packaging is nice too, easy to grip.",5
"I have shopped and shopped and shopped around for a good eczema product for my toddler and preschooler and this is not it. It certainly doesn't make their eczema worse by any means, but it doesn't help it either. I'm much more impressed with Aveeno's Baby Eczema body wash which seems about 20 times thicker and more moisturizing than this stuff. My husband likes this product though, so I keep it around for him.",3
"I'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I'm not styling it. I love this product because it's a spray, and it's quick to use. It doesn't leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!I mostly love it because it's a spray and not a cream. It's cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out.",5
"This has drastically improved the feel of my hair which had been dried out from excessive highlighting/coloring.  When I'd shampoo, my fingers would get stuck in my hair from the gnarly tangles and damage (felt like broomstick hay).  I started using this after every wash, in addition to another leave in spray from Pravana, and my hair really does feel different now.  It is great at undoing tangles and improves hair's feel.  I LOVE it.",5
"A bit of background: I have had cellulite since I was a preteen and have tried nearly every method and cream and lotion to get rid of it with very little success. I recently started working out and making a shift to a healthier lifestyle in February 2013 but still felt like I needed that extra help. If you have done your research, you know that cellulite requires a varied plan of attack to even improve the condition, let alone rid yourself of it. My cellulite even after 5 months of clean eating and weight training had only improved from a stage 4 to a mild 3 at best. I kid you not, with the addition of Finulite and consistent dry brushing before every shower, I have no visible cellulite. I have never in my 27 years of life worn shorts in public until this summer... EVER. I was proud to wear shorts this year thanks to this product and a lot of hard work. It will definitely serve you well to make sure you are keeping your sugars and carbs to a minimum and eating the right foods, drinking plenty of water and getting a good multivitamin in every day. I also take a Lecithin supplement which has been known to reduce cellulite as well. All in all, yes I would, have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of cellulite. It's so cheap compared to your alternatives, it has all the right ingredients and it works just as described. Do no hesitate to buy!!!",5
"I normally only wear eye makeup - I never wear foundation, blush, bronzers, or any type of powder on my face. I saw this when I was buying some eyeliners, and I have to admit that I was suckered in by the name and the fact that the product was a shimmery pinkish nude color. I figured if nothing else, I could try using it as an eyeshadow.I brought it home and put just a small amount on my cheeks, and I am really obsessed. So now I wear it daily, and I get so many compliments on my skin! It is not a highligher - maybe more of an illuminizer? (And you cannot use it as and eyeshadow as I originally thought - way too light.) In any event, it is a very sheer, slightly shimmery product that makes my skin look dewy and fresh (not glittery, which I was afraid of). So many people have told me I have beautiful skin when I wear this. Honestly, I think if you have reasonably clear skin (which I get by usingOxy Maximum Action Advanced Face Wash, 5 Ounce- I've gotten maybe five blemishes over the course of the two-ish years that I've been using that product), you can just throw a little bit of this product on your cheeks, and people will think your skin is amazing. I highly recommend!If you are looking for more of a classic highlighting product for your eyes, I recommend BeneFit High Beam.",5
"I was so excited to use this mask as I recently colored my hair and it was recommended as safe for color-treated hair. NOT TRUE. I used it the first time and was not impressed with the results; my hair looked dull and frizzy. I thought maybe it was a fluke because we've had a run of bad weather here in the South, and that the wind and humidity was at fault. So I used it a second time 5 days later. Results were the same, only worse. After the third time I was thinking What the...? My hair was very dry, dull, frizzy and unmanageable. I looked on the label and saw that it contains keratin protein. That explains the bad results. I am not sure why keratin needs to be in any hair product; hair is made of keratin already so isn't that overkill?!?! My hairdresser warned me away from protein hair masks several years ago because she said they will dry out your hair with overuse. I didn't even overuse this product and it still dried out my hair.To boot, there is barely a hint of the wonderful fragrance of Agadir's shampoo & conditioner in this. I am not sure if that is normal as I purchased it here and not in a salon or drugstore so have nothing with which I can make a comparison. I can mostly smell the plastic of the container. I do use and like the shampoo & conditioner which are keratin-free.I had been getting ready to blame my hairdresser for putting bad color on my hair or for leaving the color on too long because my hair had gotten to be such a mess! I was in CVS yesterday looking at makeup and such and as usual wandered over to the hair products aisle. There I saw a very small spray bottle of It's a 10 Leave-in Conditioner. I bought it because it stated on the label that it's good for colored hair (but so did the Agadir!). I washed and conditioned with Agadir today (not the mask though) then sprayed my hair pretty heavily with It's a 10. I didn't dare hope for much but was SO pleasantly surprised to see that my hair was once again easy to comb and after drying was smooth and soft and manageable. So, if your hair got messed up by this mask, I highly recommend the It's a 10 spray-on conditioner. There are 2 types - one has keratin and obviously I advise staying away from that one. Just get the regular one, it has restored my fine, medium-length hair to its former healthy condition.",1
"I have combination skin, that is sensitive.  The Nature's Best Vitamin C Serum arrived very quickly from Amazon.com.  It came packaged well in a glass bottle with a glass dropper.  At first I noticed the dropper was flat on the bottom, compared to other ones that have a pointed tip. After trying it, it actually allows for precision application.I have been using Nature's Best Vitamin C Serum for 1 week now and I am very pleased with the results. My skin is softer and my skin tone is more even.  I do not have those rough dry patches that I experienced before use.  I also noticed that the oily areas I usually have around my nose are gone too.  Overall I am very pleased with the results so far.",4
"I'll start off by saying I have extremely frizzy, wavy hair with flyaways. I am South Asian, with thick hair, and this product makes my hair super soft and silky. The flyaways don't go away, because the conditioner isn't meant to get rid of that, but it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, which is great because I use a flat iron often, and my hair can get dry. It also smells great, and the tub lasts for MONTHS if you use the conditioner three times a week! Of course this depends on the length of your hair (I have mid-length hair). This product is especially good for preserving your hair color, which is important, as I dye my hair and want to keep the color as long as possible. Pair this with the matching shampoo, and it will work wonders on your hair!",5
"Was worried this would be gimmicky, but it's perfect, especially for the winter.  It gives me the option to either not put on lotion right after the shower (for instance if I'm going to blow out my hair and don't want greasy fingers), or add lotion and double up on moisture.Scent is a little stronger than I might like/expect but my boyfriend loves the way my skin smells now so I can't complain!",5
"I can't imagin cleaning my brushes without this glove. I dont know what took me so long to purchase it. I saw a few makeup gurus use this brush and I was impressed with what I saw. I am very, very pleased!",5
"I got this for my wife to use, she typically uses the Clear brand of shampoo and figured she would give this a shot.  While with this shampoo you get twice as much for the price, 25 oz instead of 12.9 oz she still prefers Clear over tresemme. No complaints on the scent.",3
This 5X magnification wall mount mirror gives perfect viewing size for makeup application without distorting ones face. It tilts to normal view on the reverse side. The mirror is easy to install and extends far enough from the wall to make it easy to view while standing to view oneself from in the mirror. The mirror size captures the entire face.,5
"This is cheap: in price and in quality. I can't complain because I hardly paid for shipping, but I haven't been able to make any use of it either because it just looks too cheap and cheesy. I wouldn't even put it on my toddler.",1
"Axe's Peace Hair Styling Cream is a product with a noticeably masculine fragrance. The cream acts a lot like a mousse or a gel, allowing you to style your hair as you like. The cream gives your hair a bit of a tacky feel, but a natural, dry look, rather than the wet look of a gel. Axe describes the fragrance as citrus-pepper-ginger. Whatever it is, I like it. You use just a fingertip amount for your hair, and it allows you to restyle and re-touch your hair throughout the day if need-be. I think most men will really like this product.",5
"This product makes the mani and pedis quick and easy.You see the cuticles come right off! It does the work for you.I highly recommend it, and the size off the bottle can last you for awhile.",5
"I love the fact that this primer is cheap--super cheap! I mean, unless it's going to give you a facelift and make you look 10 years younger, primer is just a primer...It fills in little marks on your skin and gives you an even canvas to apply your makeup. And this goes on really nicely, fills in pores, smooths the skin, and makes your makeup glide on.I've used cheaper primers, ones in the same range and more expensive ones and this is the best of the bunch--with the exception of the super-pricey ones. The only thing the more expensive ones do better is they give the added bonus of brightening the skin--but at like $30 more. Really, if you apply your makeup correctly you don't need a brighter under your makeup unless you've had a really, really bad night.lol So the $8 that this costs is a great deal!For anyone who has acne concerns, this is one of the few primers I found that does not clog pores or cause breakouts. It might take a couple of weeks adjusting to it at first where you might get a clogged pore or two, but if you apply lightly and wash well at night, it's no big deal and your skin will adjust to it really quickly. I don't break out at all now when I use it, and it's pretty much my go-to product because I know it works well and won't break me out.It's a shame that there aren't more Avon reps around because this is one of my beauty staples and I've had to resort to buying it on Amazon. But it's really worth it!!",5
"I recently bought two gorgeous colors of Revlon lipstick: Fabulous Fig and Highbeam Tan. I was pleased to discover that the Fabulous Fig rates surprisingly safe on the EWG Skindeep site, but the Highbeam Tan has a poor score and is full of parabens and other junk. It's too bad, because Highbeam Tan is such a fantastic color. I wish companies like Revlon would clean up the ingredients in their products. It isn't that hard, or that expensive, to make lipstick that contains safer ingredients. The Fabulous Fig vs. the Highbeam Tan is a perfect example of this.",3
"i have used many different creams for cleansing over the years and Murad is the best! no muss no fuss, i use it it the shower",5
"I wear lipstick from the minute I get up until I go to bed.  I've tried many other kinds, but I always go back to this.  It's simply the best.  It's very long wearing and unless you eat something greasy, it stays on most the day.  The darker colors have more staying power.  The conditioner on one end has a glossy shine, but if you don't like that, let it wear off.  You will need it at first or your lips will feel dry.  After the gloss wears off, you probably won't notice it.  I don't.  I really like that it has no fragrance. The only thing I don't like, is I can't carry it in my pocket without it coming unscrewed.",5
This one was a little too strong for me. I going back to the 40%. But I love this company! I will always use it for my peels as well as the follow up care products.,4
"This is truly a great gift for the men in your life.  Very high class, and impressive.  Therefore, I would strongly recommend the purchase of this product.  DAME HILDA",5
"Clubman PInaud Special Reserve After Shave Lotion is a rather linear and yet at the same time complex fragrance upon first generous splashes (DO NOT over-splash with this one) with heavy top-notes of base dark spice and ceylon cinnamon along with pine tar and light burnt rubber.Mid-notes offer up a heavier smoldering amber ember, well-worn leather, balsam fir and mandarin orange. It pretty much stays exactly that way through a fairly long and subtle &#34;fade-out&#34; dry-down. This is a surprisingly potent composition from House of Pinaud...a fairly powerful fragrance with a worthy longevity, respectable sillage (when applied judiciously) being sold at what could be considered &#34;bargain basement&#34; pricing all adds up to a must-have...believe me, get it and you'll agree.A value-oriented and timeless fragrance from Edouard Pinaud that's within everybody's budget ...what more could you ask for?",4
"Creamy, moisturizing, smells and tastes like a watermelon indeed!! I will upload a picture of this sweet color. It is just amazing",5
"I would buy this product again. It good for skin ,hair. It made my skin look so healthy and made my hair grow longer.  It only takes a little because of the oily content. Try it .",5
"I received Argan Oil in exchange for honest review from Tomoson. Even though I have real short hair (shaved to mini afro depending on the day), I still have issues with dryness and itchiness. I been looking for products to help relieve the issues without being too greasy or oily. Argan Oil was a good solution. I apply a few drops in my head a few times a day. The product also helps moisturize your hair and gives it a little shine.",5
"This new Vaseline product is wonderful. I first tried it on my hands, then my arms. It smells so clean, and goes on smooth. It absorbs quickly, leaving you soft, and smelling sweet. It has such a wonderful scent, clean smelling, is what comes to mind. I was hesitant in getting this product, because most Vaseline products feel greasy to me, but this one absorbs so quickly, it just makes you feel soft, without the slime feel. Try this product, and you will like it too.",5
"small bottle, not very good. Does not seem to do anything but smell funny and costs way too much for the size, even if it was big it still isn't worth it as it doesn't work well. I have think long wavy brown hair.",2
Love it!! Beats waiting in long lines at the mall. I would definately order again. The price is right on!,5
"I unfortunately did break out from using this product, for the first tim ever got 2 red marks , similar to a mosquito bite? , next to my eye! I only applied the product to the left side of my face and also on my laugh lines it broke me out.The seller Ultimate Cosmetics was awesome. I did not even have to send the product back, but he send me for free the full size version of a copper and peptide serum/creme that I now been using for 4 days. Stil have to review it , but give this product a try. Everyones skin is different .",3
"This is some nice mascara for the price. I've been frustrated with other mascaras because they seem to be either a good quality product with unscary ingredients OR they're inexpensive. This is both.The mascara brush is really nice and provides full lashes without any clumping. It's probably my favorite mascara brush/wand that I've ever used.The color is fine - your usual espresso, not very brown. It doesn't come off easily with water, which I personally would have preferred, but you can't win em all. I'd get this again.",4
"This hairspray has great, long lasting hold without making my hair look like it's coated in hair product or feel crunchy. I've started to use this spray whenever I put my hair up (since I have short hair, I need a lot of help keeping it in place) and it stays in whatever style all day long.",5
Received this on the Vine program to review but contains almond oil. Some nut allergy sufferers are told to not use ANY products with nut oils of any kind.  Be aware.,3
I absolutely love their lipsticks!!  I have purchased numerous colors!  Reasonably priced! Very good bargain. I think there are colors for everyone's taste.,5
"How disappointing, this used to be the best sunscreen ever!  It used to go on smooth, leave no greasy residue or white cast, and it smelled almost like almonds.  Now it is very chalky, and the mere act of rubbing it on makes these little white particles form all over your skin, kind of like the rubbery leftovers from a pencil eraser.  Bummer!  I switched to Skinceuticals tinted spf 50 sunscreen and it's much better.",1
"Most definetly worth the money. I love this blush, goes on so nicely and gives you a great glow! Beautiful color that lives up to the hype!!!",5
This product works amazing for me and I have SEVERE oily skin..This stuff keeps my makeup on and prevents shine for hours..If you are worried about looking cakey get it in translucent. Its practically invisible. And love the price. Highly recommend for anyone with oily skin that has trouble with shine!,5
"I just began using this Purifying Mud mask and so far I am very pleased.  It's easy to use - no long drawn out treatment process. All you do is clean your skin, apply the mask to your face and leave for 10-15 minutes. After the mask is completely dry, rinse with warm water in gentle circles, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.  I put it on before getting in the shower, and do something while it dries (make the bed, change out the laundry, get my clothes ready - anything really - 10 minutes goes by fast) then jump in the shower to rinse off.  Easy!  It's too early at this point to say what long term benefits I will gain from using this product, but right off the bat my skin was softer after using it and had a nice 'glow'.  It was also gentle on my face, and there was NO drying of my skin.  I LOVE that the ingredients are non-toxic, which is extremely important to me.  I recommend this product for anyone looking for a purifying mask.  It also has a nice packaging, and would recommend it for a gift as well. I didn't give it a 5 star only because of the short time I have been using it and that I can't verify long term results.",4
"This is a very interesting cream.  It is not greasy and is thicker than I expected.  The scent is a little strange somewhat medicinal with a hint of coffee.  When I apply it there is a slight tightening effect which doesn't last long, and my skin is soft and feels moisturized.  I did notice that it stated to reduce water retention, and in my case it does work for that.  Not much difference with the cellulite yet but it hasn't been that long.",4
"I bought this in both black and brown, and love it. Good staying power and color. However, the brush was a little difficult to work with. It's a flat brush with a rounded tip, and it's difficult to get a smooth sweeping line. At the suggestion of other reviewers, and a youtube tutorial, I upgraded to a short angled brush and was thrilled with the difference. I choseSigma Small Angle - E65, which wound up being perfect. Short bristles that were just firm enough to keep the angled shape of the brush. I was able to get a great smooth line with a perfect wing the first time I used it.",4
"This is the greatest. I fly often so I bought this with the intention of spritzing during/after a long flight. I never got around to putting it in a &#60;3oz bottle but whatever. Chicago winters are brutal on my skin so I need all hands on deck. I put this on before bed (after a facial oil, intense moisturizer, the whole shebang) and my skin doesn't feel complete without it. It smells so nice too.  I also spritz during the day when I'm feeling a little dry but too lazy to put on lotion. I'm also more comfortable with spraying this while wearing makeup than I would be with applying a full on moisturizer.I've also tried a L'Occitane facial spray, but this one is so much better. I'm not opposed to trying other brands, but this stuff is so good I won't need to.",5
"It smells and feels nice, but I haven't noticed any difference in my skin whatsoever. It didn't break me out, either, but we are all different.",3
"Been using this for almost two weeks maybe around every other day. It seems to reduce redness, prevent breakouts and lessen current problem areas. It's not *too* drying, but I wouldn't use it every day unless you have oily skin. Good for normal/combination/oily faces. The scent is nice, but doesn't linger.",4
"i absolutely love this! when i got it in the mail, it was pretty quick!!! i love the color and im just overjoyed by it!!!",5
"I used to have pretty bad acne, but thankfully it cleared up! I do sometimes get the occasional pimple..yippee. Lucky me, I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation. I bought this on a whim and thought I'd try it on my bad timing zit. I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!I don't think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it's great!",4
"I have used glycolic acid 70% for a while and was satisfied.  I decided to try this brand and I am glad that I did.  There is less burning (always some) and it leaves my skin smooth, soft, and very clean feeling.  I have thick, somewhat course skin, but I feel like the glycolic acid is leaving my skin with a finer texture and more youthful looking.",5
"I would not recommend this product.  Each time I used it, it started burning way too quickly (yes my scalp was greased up first).  My hair never came out as straight as it does with other products and the sub-par results it does give, does not last long. Typically I only relax my hair every 6-8 weeks.  I had to get a touch up in 4 weeks using this brand.",1
"OMG... this is horrible!!!! My baby doesnt have a sensitive skin... but when I put this on her face... OMG she broke out so much, received the worst rash I have ever seen! How is this possible and what in the world is in this thing... shouldnt this be sensitive towards a babys skin? What toxins are in there? Horrible. I felt so bad for my baby. Will send it back for sure- the company should definitley look into this...this shouldnt be happening. Will not purchase and not recommend to anyone.",1
"I purchased the shampoo here on Amazon but went elsewhere for the conditioner due to price/lack of Prime shipping option at the time. Overall, I like this stuff.I dye my hair a LOT - bright, bright colors. I use dyes that are actually DYES, they stain the hair, they are not chemical dyes with developer. Hence, they can fade very easily. Because of this, I use sulfate free shampoos, and their corresponding conditioners. For a while I was using the Everpure/Everstrong lines from L'oreal but decided to upgrade. While this costs a bit more, it's definitely a good investment. It lathers nicely, and your hair will still definitely run (that's inevitable) I find no major noticeable difference in fading for several washes, and colors last weeks before fading, and then months of being a lightened version of the original color. I enjoy this, since with cheap shampoos, faded out colors tend to just look.. gross and dingy. This provides a nice fade (however, I must attribute part of this to the fact I use good hair dye, too. :) )",4
"This is one of my favorite lotions, it doesn't have a strong smell and it its creamy. I haven't really seen any firming, but I do like it.",5
This probably works for some people and not for others.  I didn't see much happening for me and tried something else.,3
"I've always been a fan of Neutrogena products. It says a lot that these inexpensive moisturizers are approved and recommended by dermatologists ... including my own. Even the most sensitive skin seems to flourish under Neutrogena's care ...Now, as someone who uses Renova, I need a no-frills nighttime moisturizer to layer over this (potentially) drying product. And, admittedly, it is difficult to find a product without AHAs, grape-seed, CoQ10, etc... (which can be irritating when combined with Renova). So, I usually use CeraVue (which is VERY basic and effective). Nontheless, CeraVue is a bit on the ""thin"" side and I would like something slightly thicker for night. Neutrogena's Ageless Moisturizer has the thick consistency that CeraVue lacks and delivers a generous shot of moisture. It genuinely plumps dry skin! (Which is a temporary effect, of course, but it also keeps my skin from peeling as a result of the Renova).My only concern: the jar's design. No matter how clean your hands seem, germs are inevitable. I (usually) avoid any product in a jar, because about half-way through the product, it tends to be significantly contaminated. This, of course, can lead to contact dermatitis and a number of other problems. If Neutrogena Ageless Moisturizer were available in a tube, I would be much happier (because there are a number of ways to avoid contact with the actual bottle-tip.)Even with its ""delivery flaw,"" I highly recommended this moisturizer ... especially to those who use strong retinoids,  Kudos to Neutrogena for another great product!",4
I have combination skin and my husband has beautiful normal skin and this works great on both of us..It is not greasy..We use it as night cream bc it does NOT have SPF but it's ok bc we already have another SPF moisturizer we use for during the day..I highly recommend it...,5
"No matter how much you think that you did great job cleaning or exfoliating, you will be disappointed when use this!!!!  it did a good job clearing my face and my shoulders of acnes when you use it daily and handling the discoloration of you body. But you have to be patient and use it daily",5
This product smells great and makes my skin really smooth. I use it in the shower once per week. The price is reasonable.,5
"I have put this over top of some of my other colors and it just pops!!  The picture makes it look like just silver, but it all sorts of colors very delicate so can cover over top of pretty much any color to change the look.",5
Very Happy with this moisturizer. Smells great and makes my skin sooo soft. Plus reasonably priced. I use this everyday after a shower.,5
i love this product! Came in fast .. i dont use it on a daily base but it seems to last me for forever i have this one tube for over 2 years now lol,5
"I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  I take great care in how I clean my brushes, so having something that allows my nice clean brushes to not only dry evenly but also retain their shape is wonderful.  This product will help extend the life of your brushes, since they will not become splayed and unable to be used the way you need them to.  Well done, Sigma.",5
Love this color. It looks amazing in any light and I get a ton of compliments when I wear it.,5
"I have never been in love with my nose. I always thought it could be cuter, more dainty and visually appealing. I don't particularly hate it enough to have it operated on because of the risks involved with surgery. It is just slightly bulbous towards the bottom and there is a very slight hump that is only noticeable from certain angles. I don't know if I can recommend this product for someone who feels differently than me and would actually pursue rhinoplasty.I have been using these nose clips nearly a month and I'm so far satisfied with the effect. I am less self-conscious about my nose looking out of proportion with the rest of my face and I feel that now I tend to photograph better and with more confidence.I had to take intermittent breaks when I first began using it because it was a bit uncomfortable until a few days later when I finally broke it in. (I use it for an hour or two per day).It's definitely a plus that you receive two of the clips because some break more easily than others, but I can't expect the quality control to be on point considering the product costs only one dollar. The first of the pair that I used broke after only a day but the second has lasted me close to a month. I would be more than satisfied with it even if it needed to be replaced monthly. A dollar is a very small price to pay for the notable results. I will surely continue buying these.Living on the East Coast I waited roughly one month for this to arrive. Again I cannot complain having only spent a dollar for the product AND the shipping.",5
"For my purposes, this brush is comparable to my way too expensive Mac version (130 i believe). I have had the Mac brush for a good number of years and only got this one because mine was beginning to shed so we'll have to see if it'll stand the test of time but so far it does what i need it to. It is a bit softer and the bristles are longer if you're a stickler for details but it works for me.",4
This soap smells amazing and it works great.  Doesn't take much and its not greasy like some of the concentrated dish soaps.  All natural ingredients so you don't have to worry about tricylsan or petrochemicals.,5
"I have very fine, but dry hair. But I have a lot of those hairs and some natural wave, so I describe my hair as fluffy not stuffy. I notice a difference from my first use. I used my usual conditioner after this shampoo. But my hair feels much more soft and silky. I don't use gel or hairspray, etc., as I enjoy my natural hair.",5
"Absolutely LOVE this. I have sensitive skin, so finding a sulfate-free shampoo is always a plus for me. This was my first time getting a brightening shampoo, though, and I'm now addicted! My hair hasn't stayed this blonde for this long EVER. It's been months since I've had my hair highlighted. Usually, but this time, it looks horrid. Yes, I still need to get my hair done, but it really doesn't look bad at all. So glad I found this miracle worker!",5
I love this color. Essie is always a hit or miss for me. This is definitely a hit! Plus i love the name!,5
"Let me start out by saying that I have been blessed with great skin, am pushing 40 and have started to see a wrinkle here and there and several ""age or sun spots"".  I chose this product mainly to hopefully lighten some of the spots but alas, this product did not deliver on it's promise to fade age spots.  It did, however, in the first 7 days of treatment, make my skin a tad brighter and certainly smoother.  The three different products that are in this set all have a great smell and I especially enjoyed the mask.  If Olay packaged just the mask itself, I would buy it as I think the masks would be great in the summer if you got a little too much sun on your face or in the cold of winter for dry, chapped skin.All in all this Olay was just ""OK"" for me...",3
"You may have to buy this in bulk for it to work. But I wont be doing that. Bought my first jar applied twice a day sometimes 3. This product does nothing. Decided to go the natural route to help with stretch marks and purchased shea butter instead, much more affordable and there is plenty to purchase here on Amazon.",1
Returned.  Not sure if it is defective or just awful.  No blowing power.  Didn't get hair dry.,1
"Bought this product to try out for the first time.  Have not been using consistently like I would like.  BUT when I do use it, it seems to do the trick!  Dries annoying zits/pimpes and even brings to surface like blackheads.  I would recommend this product!",5
"Shipping was super fast and the price for these is great. They all came individually packaged and the colors are are vibrant as they show on the pictures. Don't use them on their own; apply a top coat over them so that they can stay on your nails, otherwise the tape won't stick for long.",5
"GIVE DRY, UNCOMFORTABLE SKIN A TREAT WITH PALMERS COCOA BUTTER FORMULA.  ENRICHED WITH VITAMIN E IN A SOOTHING EMOLLIENT BASE, THIS UNIQUE MOSTURIZER HEALS AND SOFTENS ROUGH DRY SKIN.

"keeps even my fair skin hydrated and extreme color for a irish girl w freckles. no odor, recommend to everyone!!!",5
"This has a nice, bright but sheer color to it without any glitter (finally)! It has a rather strong &#34;makeup&#34; smell to it, which some may mind more than others. I have not found that it lasts a whole day on my face as others have reported - but then again, no blush does (is my skin somehow more slippery?)",4
"These lashes had a very natural appearance when on and I would definitely recommend them for anybody with sparse or short lashes to add a little bit of extra volume. The tools and glue that came with the lashed were not the best however, the glue was difficult to get out of the container and would often bubble up when trying to put the lid back on. The brush was also completely unnecessary for anybody used to putting false lashes on. Final verdict: great natural looking lashes, buy a different lash glue.",3
My son has used every product Axe makes and is looking forward to making this a part of his grooming routine. He normally keeps his hair short but did use this before he got his hair cut and said it worked very well.,3
it lasts for only 3 hours which is not good in my book cause I need sthng that will last the whole day I am at work. Also I got 2 products of the same color (eternal red) each product gave a different shade of red. I used revlon before and it was great but the choices were very limited ..,3
"i was a little skeptical...i have fine, thin hair (it always has been), and i highlight my hair too. i have found that the closer i get to 50, the more breakage i was experiencing also. i have been using this for about 2 months and it has made my hair stronger and i dont seem to see as much falling out. it makes my hair feel so soft and silky without making it fall flat. try it and you will love it too!",5
Did not like this product. Smells awful and it after using it I did not get that fresh clean feeling.,2
"My hair is very thick and curly. I really was not too impressed with this product. I smoothed it over my hair after a shower and I expected it to smooth my hair and take the frizz away but it didn't really do that. If I added more to my hair, it would just weigh it down. I didn't notice any shine and after a while I was basically just using it to use it up. It didn't damage my hair or really help it so I just used it up. I won't repurchase this.",3
"I want my deodorant to perform its task in the background - unnoticed. I don't want to feel it once applied and certainly don't want to smell it. The Cool Silver non-irritant antiperspirant by Dove Men+Care satisfies this primary expectation.Cool Silver has one nifty feature my previous deodorant didn't - a locking device that turns around and back again to insure no-one else uses my deodorant. It is sorta OK if my son uses my deodorant once in a while but I don't want house guests sneaking into my bathroom for some instant protection. So this is a nice feature, if you are a little paranoid like I am.The instructions did say to apply to underarms only but I did apply it across my stomach and so far nothing's happened. That's up to you. Overall, I am very satisfied with Dove's Cool Silver.",4
"Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds is by far the best cleaning product my family has ever used. We use it to mop our tile floors, clean our kitchen appliances, wash clothes, wash our cars, wipe down wood and leather furniture, clean up spills on upholstery, wash down concrete and more. Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds never fails to do a fantastic job at meeting our cleaning needs. Also, a little bit goes a long way. One squirt of Sal Suds in a three gallon bucket is all that is needed to create a bubbly mixture of cleaning heaven.",5
"I'm a big fan of the scent of roses and was looking for a signature perfume. This smells really pretty - almost exactly like a tea rose, which were in my garden growing up. You can't beat the price for the amount of perfume you get. Just watch out how much you spray. It smells so good, it's easy to overdo it... but you don't need much.",5
I have been using this for 6 months morning and night after washing and has really made a difference with my under eye wrinkles. I put the night recovery over it as i have really dry skin and most day creams dont cut it! Will buy over and over again!,5
This is the first lipstick I have ever bought. Needless to say I will definitely buy this again!! I will need this color!! It looked fantastic on me which was a big thing for me because I have never liked lipstick but this color had changed my that! I still have to put gloss over it because it does dry out my lips quite a bit but I'm ok with that because I don't like the matte-ness of lipstick.,5
