It seems a bit heavy though.4,Waheed Haq,3-Jun-18,, ,Material is good and the umbrella performs well.5,N. Padilla,3-Jun-18,, ,Fits very nice in my back pack.  Look and and feel are very durable.1,Vladimir Bykov,1-Jun-18,, ,Recently used this umbrella... I don't know where from All those 5 stars reviews coming from? But my advice - don't buy! My story short:  &#34;From parking lot to the store entrance - 40 seconds walk. Moderate rain with a wind no more 10mph. This umbrella was flipping back and forth like a daisy flower... and I got soaking wet&#34; returning.4,Dana,1-Jun-18,, ,"Very nice umbrella,  but a little bulky and heavy as travel umbrella."5,David,1-Jun-18,, ,"extra strong for windy, rainy days"5,John,1-Jun-18,, ,"Great seller, great umbrella....much better made than the last travel sizes umbrella I owned"5,Silvina C.,1-Jun-18,, ,"Great quality, when is close its super small so I can put in on my hand bag."5,Jeabous,31-May-18,, ,"Function works great, haven't had a chance to use it in a rainstorm but seems sturdy"5,Ken,31-May-18,, ,Very good quality5,AmazCustomer,31-May-18,, ,thanks5,Liz R.,30-May-18,, ,"Sturdy, well made umbrella in a compact package.  What's not to love?  :)"5,AmazCustomer,29-May-18,, ,"this umbrella is excellent for work - fits perfectly in my computer bag, opens every time a bit tough closing need to strong arm it - left it in an Uber car so re-ordered another one - highly recommend it"5,BobGP,29-May-18,, ,Nice  compact and sturdy umbrella.  I love the fact you can both open and close it with only one hand.  The crappy weather we've had here lately has given my plenty of time to try it out ;)3,yellowpixels,28-May-18,, ,Well built and apparently very sturdy. However it is a bit too large and heavy for my use case.5,Gary W. Jarboe,28-May-18,, ,Just expirenced tropical storm Alberta.  Liked it so much I purchased one for my wife!5,Kenneth  Holland,28-May-18,, ,This is an extremely well made product. It opens and closes easily and even in heavy rain it dries quickly. And in high winds it  pops back into place (if it even needs to)5,Andrew P. Mezey,28-May-18,, ,Easy open and close. Sturdy feel. Large enough but not too large for one person. I like it better than other collapsible umbrellas that I have had. Would definitely buy it again. Life time guarantee is very attractive.5,D. Garcia,27-May-18,, ,The product is really well made and sturdy. I used this in Panama (Central America) where there are thunderstorms and strong rains and this worked flawlessly.2,AR,25-May-18,, ,"I was excited to try out this umbrella based on its many reviews. However, once I received it, I was not impressed. The shaft of the umbrella was not very long so that meant that if I held this umbrella normally there would not be a lot of space between the top of my head and the top of this umbrella. And who wants to hold an umbrella super close like you're hugging it?Also, the width of the canopy was not great at all. It just barely covered most of my shoulders. Had I used this in actual rain, I'm pretty sure my shoulders and arms and back would've been soaked from lack of coverage.The construction of the umbrella distracted me from examining the quality of the material used. But I will say it didn't strike me as being heavy duty or anything.As I previously stated, overall I wasn't impressed with this product. I have returned it for a refund and a different product by a different brand and seller."5,mark mauldin,25-May-18,, ,The umbrella arrived promptly and appears to be well made. Weâ€™ve not had an opportunity to try it out yet.I especially like the auto open and close feature.i was also impressived with guarantee.5,R.S.E.,25-May-18,, ,The umbrella is sturdy and a quality product. I like the small size that is easy to pack.5,Fred,25-May-18,, ,Item as described. Very good!5,elaine4,25-May-18,, ,The umbrella seems sturdy and easy to open and close.  I bought this for an upcoming trip to Europe and haven't had an occasion to use it yet.  The umbrella operated as described and shipping was fast.5,Louise M.,25-May-18,, ,"Excellent umbrella, sturdy, very well made and attractive.  The size is perfect for a bag, tote or overnight luggage. This is the best umbrella I have ever bought."5,purple turtle,24-May-18,, ,"It hasn't rained yet, so I don't know how well it works in the rain. However, it opens and closes nicely and it looks and feels like it was built well."5,Roger B Rittenhouse,24-May-18,,"Finally a strong well built umbrella!  A little heavier than I would have expected, but my guess is -  this goes back to the quality.", 5,OML,24-May-18,, ,I've had the umbrella for about 2 years now and it has held up with no issues.5,Bud G,24-May-18,, ,The umbrella arrived even sooner than expected and appears to be extremely well built.  We haven't had to brave the rain since we got it but we are sure it will do the job well.  We are also impressed by the customer services' eagerness to help with any problem that may occur although we doubt we will have a problem.3,MmmmDonuts,22-May-18,, ,"Iâ€™m torn on how to rate this umbrella. Iâ€™ve used this umbrella for the last 5 months in quite a few Florida rainstorms with no problem, until a recent storm with some higher than average wind (not heavy tropical storm winds, but not a light breeze). During that storm, the umbrella blew inside out multiple times leaving me completely soaked. I have not experienced any rust or broken umbrella ribs so far. Overall, itâ€™s better than lugging a golf umbrella everywhere because itâ€™s fairly lightweight and fits in my large handbags.Pros: sturdier than a normal compact-ish umbrella, fairly lightweight, coverage size good for compact-ish umbrella.Cons: not as wind proof as advertised, not small to medium handbag friendly size."4,IJH,22-May-18,, ,Great product for relatively low cost!1,a,21-May-18,, ,"For all the hype, broke on day 1 in mild winds"1,JamesMLV,21-May-18,, ,"Lasted about 30 minutes of use. Northern Ireland wind kept flipping it inside out until finally it snapped on a way that prevented it from fully opening or closing, rendering it completely useless."5,stidriver84,21-May-18,, ,Arrived the weekend of 5/19/18. Only got a chance to use it once so far. No complaints yet.5,Bryan NYC,21-May-18,, ,It was just as described.  I used it twice now and it's one of the best umbrellas I've ever used.4,Timothy Field,21-May-18,, ,"[4.5 stars] pretty good quality for the price, no problems keeping water out, decent wind resistance could be a little better. But overall a good product."5,Nicholas Pavao,20-May-18,, ,"Works great, the cover is really hard to get back on but you don't need it. The button has worked well for the 3 months I've used it."3,Kindle Customer,18-May-18,, ,"Great travel umbrella. Nice size, like button to retract. But it broke after less than a year of occasional usage."5,mark,17-May-18,, ,"Living in the â€œWindy Cityâ€ù presents many challenges when it comes to weather. Itâ€™s great to see a product live up to the challenge, highly recommend."5,amanda kell,17-May-18,, ,Sturdy material. Opened and closed easily. Lightweight.4,Colleen,17-May-18,, ,Larger than expected. Looking for more of a travel size.4,Jafa Bob Marshall,17-May-18,, ,"does what it's supposed to do.  a little on the heavy side for a travel umbrella, but considering the engineering, not a deal buster."5,willy curran,17-May-18,, ,Great gift. They loved the easy way it opens and closes.5,Nan Feng,17-May-18,, ,nice umbrella and convenient for customer5,gj1901,17-May-18,, ,I may get to use it for the first time next week.  Looking forward to it!!5,Linda Camerlin,17-May-18,, ,"This umbrella is amazing, it opens flawlessly and closes easily.  It is very convenient to carry, too."5,AmazCustomer,16-May-18,, ,"Best umbrella!  Auto open and close, general construction and coverage first class!"5,John R. Johnson,16-May-18,, ,Works great!5,cool boots,15-May-18,, ,"it lasted through the one rain I used it in, so far."5,AmazCustomer,14-May-18,, ,I purchased this for my Chinese wife who arrived in Texas two months ago.  She is very happy with this product - it protects her against the sun and works as illustrated.5,Donna Adams,14-May-18,, ,These are the best umbrellas I have ever used.  I highly recommend them.1,dlmaddox,14-May-18,, ,All the metal rusted and rubbed off on the inside of the umbrella after its first use.  Barely able to open it now.  Disappointing.5,SM,14-May-18,, ,"It might as well be the nicest umbrella we have ever owned! Seriously this is a very well-made umbrella which was actually designed with some milestones/goals in mind and the build quality is undoubtedly better that anything I have seen in my entire life. I bet that there are fancier or sturdier or more expensive ones out there, but by far, this comes across as a really trustworthy umbrella if there is such a thing! I strongly encourage others to try it out for a little more $$ than your average Walmart stuff."3,Kyle,13-May-18,, ,Small and opens and closes easily. I still have had it flip out in wind gusts.1,Riley,10-May-18,, ,"This umbrella actually broke after a week of heavy winds, don't buy if you live in a place with heavy winds I guess. Can I get my free replacement?"5,Bookdiva,10-May-18,, ,"Excellent umbrella, very sturdy, never once buckled in the wind. High quality materials."5,Melissa Egnor,9-May-18,, ,Exactly how described and was delivered fast!5,AmazCustomer,9-May-18,,"I have not yet has the opportunity to use them yet because it hasn't rained since I purchased them. I think they will be wonderful, though.They are made with quality materials and the mechanics of the umbrella going up and down with the push of the button is the finest I've ever seen.", 5,AmazCustomer,8-May-18,, ,"high quality, durable. I've had this for a few months and it's never let me down."5,Bookreader,8-May-18,, ,I ordered this umbrella for my husband.  He has not had an opportunity to use it yet but he is very happy with the quality and the way it opens and closes with the push of a button.  We will be traveling by plane soon and this will fit nicely in the suitcase.  Thank you.5,Fluffy,8-May-18,, ,A very handy umbrella. Very compact in size. Feels well constructed.5,Raymond C. Nadeau,8-May-18,, ,very impressed with the quality3,Eric B,8-May-18,, ,"Failed on me in a bad way - had only used it a dozen times, suddenly it would not close.  I had a long bus ride with an open umbrella.  Would have thrown it away but weather was bad at destination and I had a mile walk once there."5,Bradley Phares,8-May-18,, ,"So far, so good! I haven't had to use it in high winds yet, but the umbrella seems to be made of really great quality!"5,barry stephenson,7-May-18,, ,Great product5,Nicky,7-May-18,, ,"Great sturdy travel umbrella. A little heaver than the lightest ones, but I can trust it and have no problem packing it in rainy situations."4,Perry,7-May-18,, ,The only umbrella that has lasted me longer than a few months.  2 years and going strong!  Very hard to close (or maybe I'm just weak).5,D. Gregorio,7-May-18,, ,"When taking it out of the box, the first thing I noticed was its weight. Itâ€™s heftier than I expected, but not too much to keep in a backpack.There was rain soon after it arrived, so I was able to test it out. It does itâ€™s job with no problem. The release button works well and isnâ€™t too sensitive. The teflon coating helped to dry it quickly, which is an added bonus."5,Stephen A. Denahan,7-May-18,, ,Great product. Easy to open and close. I'm delighted!4,Alvin,6-May-18,, ,"small enough for easy carry, overall is a pretty decent made umbrella. I just wish the carry bag they can make it a little bit bigger because is a bit hard to put the bag back on"5,Zavage,6-May-18,, ,"Being a bachelor, I never really felt the need to own an umbrella since I could just wear a hooded jacket if necessary. Reality hit me in the face real quick when it stormed intensely one day as I was walking across campus. It was miserable as you could guess. So of course, I decided to finally get my first umbrella and ran across this beaut. I have absolutely no complaints for it: it's simple and black as it should be, it opens up very easily, and has so far been able to resist powerful winds. I'll be using this for as long as I possibly can when needed."4,R.D.H.,6-May-18,, ,Just received the umbrella yesterday.  Looks real good.  Repels water just like advertised.  The button open and close is a great feature.Now just can't wait for rain....5,Raymond,6-May-18,, ,Excellent umbrella. Holds up well in the wind. I like the fact that it opens and closes with the push of a button. I've bought two.5,techyoda,5-May-18,, ,"For the first time in my life I have put some thought into the umbrella I have purchased.  I live in Southern California so it doesn't rain much but when it does, I want to have a reliable and durable umbrella on hand.  I was impressed with this the moment I opened it.  I'm hoping it will last me a very long time"5,AmazCustomer,5-May-18,, ,I love how easy it is to open and close it. It's good for both men and women.5,Marty3,5-May-18,, ,"I havenâ€™t had to use this in any torrential downpours, thankfully LOL however this does open very quickly which will be beneficial when youâ€™re in some sort of rain storm, and the close button also works very well, this does only close the top part of the umbrella you do have to slide it down to completely  Close the pole part  Overall I am very pleased with this umbrella, it does appear very durable"1,Shopaholicru2,5-May-18,, ,"Brought 2 umbrellas to NYC for Easter vacation and 1 broke the very first time I used it. Very, Very, Very disappointed. Afraid to us the other one!"5,Markus Miller,4-May-18,, ,"I was very impressed with the quality of this umbrella, so much so, that I purchased a second for a family member.  LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That wil tell you that they are confident with the construction.  Folds nice and small to fit just about anywhere.  Very happy with this purchase."5,christine lorek,4-May-18,, ,sturdy in the wind5,Kelly D,4-May-18,, ,"Purchased for a trip to Europe.  While I did not need to use it, it was compact enough to fit inside a tote bag and was not too heavy to carry around all day."2,AA,3-May-18,, ,"I bought this about a year ago but didn't use it for more than a couple of weeks total.It still works just fine, but the umbrella itself isn't any more &#34;windproof&#34; than generic packable umbrellas from my school's gift store. The metallic part that extends feels very flimsy and sways with strong winds too easily. Not at all rigid as I expected.As long as it works (which it does) then I'm happy, but my biggest gripe is the top part of the umbrella just fell off one day. Again, I don't use this umbrella often. It's been in a wardrobe for the majority of the past year until Spring weather came along.I don't get why this is advertised as very durable. Had to deduct 3 stars for advertising an average umbrella as some miracle umbrella."5,Peter Lazorcik,3-May-18,, ,"Great, durable, sturdy umbrella. Doesn't get ruined in the wind. Big enough to keep you and your significant other dry, but not obnoxiously big. 10/10 would recommend!"5,Larry Dodson,3-May-18,, ,Stood up to Seattle and Denver rain and wind. Strongly repels water and does not buckle n strong winds Highly recommend5,Dustin Rhodes,3-May-18,, ,A great high-quality umbrella with pushbutton to deploy and to my surprise push button to retract. Have not used the product yet but seems to have excellent coverage and built from quality materials.1,KMc,3-May-18,, ,"So very disappointed. This &#34;windproof&#34; umbrella turned inside out twice this morning within 5 minutes. The quality is equally poor with one of the prongs (sorry, I don't know the official name) also being detached from the fabric within two days."2,Jamar b.,2-May-18,, ,I don't like things that advertise one thing and do another. The umbrella is a very nice looking umbrella but is small. I know it's a travel umbrella but it feels way smaller then my cheap IKEA travel umbrella. Also it's super easy for the umbrella to fold up from wind. One good gust and your looking like Mary Poppins nightmare. I will say the open close mechanism works well. That's the only reason this review is not 1 star5,ALLAN,2-May-18,, ,Excellent product. High quality5,Muhammad Chaudhary,2-May-18,, ,"I've had this umbrella for about one and half years now. I wanted to wait to review a product like this to really be able to test it out long term. So far its easily the best umbrella I've ever owned. It's handled heavy winds and rain just fine and has never snapped like other umbrellas tended to do. The button to open and close it still functions great. As long as it doesn't get lost or stolen, I don't see myself needing a new umbrella for a long time.The only individuals I wouldn't recommend this to is the type of person that keeps losing their umbrella. Everyone else should get this one."2,Krysrox413,2-May-18,, ,"For all the money I paid for this umbrella, I'm incredibly disappointed that after TWO uses, the inner metal is rusting! I left it open, (not fully, since it would be in the way in my small home), but it took an eternity to dry out and when it finally had, I noticed the rust! I expected a much better quality at the cost I paid. Also, the inside has plastic parts! I was purchasing this for it's &#34;windproof&#34; ability. I guess they meant a light breeze. In real weather, this isn't the go-to. Of course, I bought it in preparation of the bad weather, and am past my return period. Oh well. Live and learn."5,Dancer,2-May-18,, ,Excellent on a trip to windy rainy Paris in April.4,Pratik,1-May-18,, ,"Great sturdy umbrella. It got 4 stars from me because it is a bit small. For someone like me who is 6 foot, it does not really help on a rainy day."4,algeorge1,1-May-18,, ,"great umbrella, small and easy to operate"5,SANDRA MARIA BEZERRA DOMINGUES,1-May-18,, ,Quality product.

And with a lifetime warranty you really can't go wrong!5,Way out west,30-Apr-18,, ,I love this umbrella. Simple product that does exactly what it needs to and doesn't malfunction.Easily fits in your backpack or purse without being clunky. I would recommend this product to anyone who just wants an umbrella to stash in their bag just in case it rains.5,Mary Oliver,30-Apr-18,, ,Using the product now in rainy Great Britain.  So far so good.  Only issue is the weight of the umbrella.  Thought it was lighter weight.1,Andrew O,30-Apr-18,, ,"One thunderstorm and the umbrella is already broken. Not sure if we got a dud, but have no idea how this is rated so highly. Windproof claim is completely inaccurate. Would not recommend."5,julie wickstrom,30-Apr-18,, ,So far so good. This shipped quickly. It is compact enough to easily fit in my laptop bag. I have used this only once and it worked well. It was not a particularly windy day but it was Boston and wind is an issue. The umbrella held up and didn't turn inside out. The sleeve cover thing is also good as I was able to put it over my wet umbrella and it stayed dry on the outside.5,joaquin nunez g,29-Apr-18,, ,"The umbrella is great, the size is perfect to carry on everywhere, I would recommend to all my friends this great umbrella"5,jnichol1,29-Apr-18,, ,Perfect size and good construction4,Bill,29-Apr-18,, ,compact and functional4,bevy104,29-Apr-18,, ,Maintains its posture with winds as indicated in discription. Fits well in kids bookbag.2,Drummer52895,29-Apr-18,, ,"I bought this umbrella because it was the highest rated umbrella on Amazon. In a moderate rain storm the water actually leaked through the fabric material! I was shocked to look up and see water coming through part of the umbrella. The fabric seemed to be porous, there was no gaping hole or other defect.Also, moderate wind was able to flip this umbrella. It did not destroy the umbrella but it did flip. Not windproof, although it does seem more rigid than most umbrellas."5,NB,29-Apr-18,, ,"The umbrella seems well made and opens/closes easily. The handle is soft and yet heavy duty. I haven't used it in the rain yet, but it certainly seems as described online."5,Tashi,28-Apr-18,, ,"No chance to use this umbrella yet, but it is beautifully made and came packaged perfectly. I look forward to using it for a very long time."5,JFD3,28-Apr-18,, ,"Compact, easy opening and closing.  Seems well constructed.  Fits in my brief case.

Customer service is great as well. If you need an solid umbrella, look no further."5,AarS.,27-Apr-18,, ,Seems like a very well made umbrella. You can feel the quality in the weight of it. Only got to use it 3 times but once was in high winds and it performed flawlessly.

It looks good though.1,AmazCustomer,26-Apr-18,, ,"Come on guys... you designed an umbrella and you donâ€™t use water resistant material ? Using steel instead of stainless steel, even if itâ€™s coated it will still rust. Why? Because itâ€™s an umbrella. Itâ€™s meant to be in constant contact with water. I know steel is cheaper than stainless but come on !!  #facepalm #design101"1,kristen,25-Apr-18,, ,"I purchased this based on the positive reviews, and it seemed to work well when the rain and wind were light.

Very disappointed."3,Anonymous,25-Apr-18,, ,I wanted an umbrella for commuting by train.

I used it for 45 minutes, closed it and then opened it up again five minutes later and it wouldnâ€™t stay open. A string was sticking out from the top and it no longer works. Very very disappointed. It worked well for 45 minutes so if you only need an umbrella for 45 minutes, this is the one to buy.  Junk"5,Linann,25-Apr-18,, ,"I work in New Haven CT, and in the fall, and winter the wind comes right off the water, so I'm always in the market for an umbrella that will last for a couple of years. I learned from experience, that there is no such thing as an umbrella that can stand up to 50 mph. Most good quality umbrellas can't stand up to winds 20 mph. What I'm looking for is a strong auto open/close, and can stand up to heavy rains. This umbrella is very good quality, with a strong open/close button. I will update when needed, as of now I'm very happy with my purchase."3,Trisha,25-Apr-18,, ,Used this umbrella on our trip to NYC.  We loved this umbrella as it was super sturdy and the opening mechanism was an added bonus.  The umbrella itself wasn't too heavy for us and it was convenient having the tie on the handle to keep it on my wrist.  But I wouldn't say that this is wind proof.  After a few gusts the umbrella was inside out and broke.  So we just used our rain jackets for the rest of our trip.2,AmazCustomer,25-Apr-18,, ,"Really wanted to like this product. I used it twice so far and the teflon coating works well for quickly drying however, one small bump into another person's umbrella on the way to work today already broke one of the fiberglass ribs.

This is still true, but I've come to realize the product (including this part) is well made.My first time using it was during a rainstorm with 50 mph gusts.  I walked 3 blocks from my work to a parking garage.  The umbrella inverted twice.  After that it did not open automatically (popped up but required manual pushing to lock in place.

The product itself is great, water repellant, easy to dry, great functionality.

Considering its price, I would definitely recommend this product for a regular use in a rain or snow."5,Susan Simpson,24-Mar-18,, ,This umbrella works very well.  Opens and closes easily and is very compact.  Fits in my son's backpack perfectly.5,Lisa Hill,24-Mar-18,,It's a great umbrella!!, 4,Robert D Bergstrom,24-Mar-18,, ,"I haven't used my umbrella as of yet, but I love how easily it opens and closes! I will reserve any further judgment until the rains come! It arrived on time, and I am very satisfied with my purchase so far."5,Umesh Bhatt,24-Mar-18,, ,Havent used much but looks good... Will share much after I get  chance to test the product...5,AmazCustomer,23-Mar-18,, ,"Sleek design, light yet durable.Easy of use."5,Arvada,23-Mar-18,, ,"Such a delight to come in from the rain, shake the umbrella, and have it almost dryâ€”dry enough it is not an issue. It is a very nice umbrella. Plus, when in the totally-closed position, the pleats lie flat so when the strap is wrapped and closed, the umbrella is very neat and tidy and slides easily into the cover."5,jennifer,23-Mar-18,,Super cute . Very good quality ! Thank you !, 1,John Pate,23-Mar-18,, ,My umbrella didnâ€™t work.  I sent it back for a refund.1,Meysam,22-Mar-18,, ,"I seriously do not know how this product got so many good reviews here. I assume most are fake. After one time of using, it stopped opening with the button properly and have to push with hand to open it. Terrible product and I am very disappointed."4,â“¡â“êâ“˜â“ù,22-Mar-18,, ,it does what a light duty umbrella does3,Chris Keith,22-Mar-18,, ,Rusty after less than a few months use.5,AmazCustomer,22-Mar-18,, ,Small enough to fit in my purse! Works well5,Philip A. Hayes,21-Mar-18,, ,"I love this umbrella.  It is well made and functions perfectly.  I bought it anticipating wet weather on a trip to the Pacific North West, and it was so intimidating, the rain didn't bother to show up.  Heading to Southern California now to see if it will also cause the sun to take cover behind a cloud."5,Manyuan Lu,21-Mar-18,, ,It's good until now.5,Bruce,21-Mar-18,, ,"This umbrella is great.  Opens and closes with the click of a button, is very sturdy, and can stand up to the wind here in San Francisco.  It's small and light weight, making it very convenient.  Also, customer service is great!  I lost the slip cover after two years.  They are replacing it for me at no charge!  Next Christmas everyone's getting Repel umbrellas!"4,Dennis W.,21-Mar-18,, ,"Just as decribed, prefect size and compact."5,Herman Granados,21-Mar-18,, ,Amazing umbrella. Just what I needed. Resistent structure. Now I can fight the rain.5,Rose Gray,21-Mar-18,, ,I gotta say this is an amazing umbrella. Only complaint would be that the handle is a bit short so I have to hold my arm higher up in the air which is slightly tiring but I think I will survive...1,Amazonian Customer,21-Mar-18,, ,"Without a doubt the most disappointing purchase Iâ€™ve ever made on Amazon. I wonâ€™t go so far as to say the worst umbrella Iâ€™ve ever owned because thatâ€™s a high bar, but completely useless. I just tried to use it for the first time and the handle fell off and wonâ€™t screw back on. Because itâ€™s raining I tried to use it anyway and the clip at the top wonâ€™t catch leaving me to have to hold it open with one hand, and soaked through. Generally flimsy."5,J. Busis,21-Mar-18,, ,Has held up well so far.5,Martin Coward,20-Mar-18,, ,Used it a couple of time works very well.1,Abbey,20-Mar-18,, ,"I very rarely write reviews, but I felt this deserved one.  The first time I used this umbrella, it flipped inside out within thirty seconds of opening it, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. I was drenched, and very unhappy.  Will be returning (another thing I very rarely do)."5,Juliana,20-Mar-18,, ,"Great umbrella! Was shipped fast, and it is just as described. Opens very smoothly, comfortable to use, great quality. Very satisfied with it."5,AarSable,20-Mar-18,,"Great umbrella, excellent price", 5,RMax,20-Mar-18,, ,"Good material, good fabric! Very solid!"5,Peggy Bonomo,20-Mar-18,, ,The best thing about this umbrella is the ease of opening and closing.  It is well constructed and a little larger than many folding umbrellas.  It will be put to the test this summer in everyday Florida rain.3,JZ1,20-Mar-18,, ,"UPDATE:  They immediately emailed me apologizing for the umbrella not meeting my full expectations. They offered a full refund or a replacement.  I declined both options because the umbrella wasn't broken and a replacement would have the same issue.  They issued a refund anyway with their apologies  Needless to say, this company truly stands behind their products.  If only all companies were like this one.Nice but annoying.  I like the automatic open/close feature but it's a pain when you only want to close it temporarily.  It won't stay up unless you completely compress it to its original position which is a little difficult if you're carrying other things."4,Scurvy230,20-Mar-18,, ,"PROS: Very portable, sturdy, and easy to use. Keeps most of the water off me, rain rolls off and stays off well. Very lightweight, button works smoothly, feels great in hand for the most part.CONS: Wish I could put two hands on it, the wind in my city is heavy and this thing gets hard to control sometimes.Will unfortunately have to get myself a two handed umbrella but this thing will work while i'm broke and in college."5,Elizabeth Stone,19-Mar-18,, ,Great umbrella. Collapses easily.5,W.Jackson,19-Mar-18,, ,It opens and shuts easily and it is large. Best of all it is wind-proof...a great umbrella.5,AmazCustomer,19-Mar-18,, ,"though heavy, it works well."5,harvey,19-Mar-18,, ,Great umbrella!  Holding up great so far.  Nice compact size.  Easy to open. Easy to close.4,Elizabeth M. Mornini,19-Mar-18,, ,I bought this umbrella based on reviews of other purchasers. Itâ€™s very good quality for its small size. Iâ€™ve had many sub-standard umbrellas previous to this one and this one far outdoes others from the past.5,Kathleen B.,19-Mar-18,,Super compact AND very sturdy!, 5,Bernard Descamps,19-Mar-18,, ,The product arrived in excellent condition and works as expected.4,TxGen,18-Mar-18,, ,"Looks sturdy, but haven't used it in strong wind yet.  Good travel size.  Opens and closes easily."
