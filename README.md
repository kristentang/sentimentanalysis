This project used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) sentiment analysis function to analyze text sentiment of four csv datasets (Amazon product reviews, beer reviews, movie reviews, and umbrella reviews). Each dataset contains a list of pairs of review content and a numeric rating. The correlation between the  user-generated ratings and NLTK-generated scores were plotted in a matplotlib bar graph. I also found wrote code to find words uniquely associated with positive and negative sentiment scores.

Some interesting words uniquely associated with reviews receiving positive sentiment scores: color, cool, Disney, Julie Andrews

I think the analysis worked uniquely on this set of data, because the reviews were for different movies, which all have different characteristics, actors, and themes. Reviews received low sentiment scores both when the reviewer did not like the move and when the movie had darker themes/plots. Along with showing words commonly associated with good movies, it also shows which movies receive high ratings and have storylines with very positive themes. For example, Disney movies, especially Mary Poppins, received high sentiment scores because it is a well liked movie and because its themes and stories are very positive.
