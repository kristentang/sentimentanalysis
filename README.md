This project used the Natural Language Tookkit (NLTK) sentiment analysis function to analyze text sentiment of four csv datasets (Amazon product reviews, beer reviews, movie reviews, and umbrella reviews). Each dataset contains a list of pairs of review content and a numeric rating. The correlation between the  user-generated ratings and NLTK-generated scores were plotted in a matplotlib bar graph. I also found wrote code to find words uniquely associated with positive and negative sentiment scores.
