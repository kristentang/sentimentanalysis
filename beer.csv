"Biggish very white head quickly goes coarse, then shrinks. Deep yellow body. Grainy watery aroma. Dry, harsh grainy taste, with some sweetness. Thin body, harsh mouthfeel. Very flat one-dimensional taste. The aftertaste has lemony notes. No actual off-tastes, but too watery and harsh for me. Drainpour. &#40;0.5l bottle, shop, Charlottenberg.&#41;",5
"Biggish coarseish offwhite shiny head quickly shrinks. Yellow body with light carbonation. Sugary roasty sweaty socks aroma (no, I&rsquo;m not joking, though I wish I were) with vegetable notes. Dry watery rubbery grain taste. Thin body, harsh intensely dusty mouthfeel. Bitter faintly grassy aftertaste. That final touch is the only positive thing about this beer. Drainpour&#033; (0.5l can, shop, Charlottenberg.)",4
"Biggish offwhite head. Deep red body. Firm roasty malty aroma with strong sharp citric hopnotes. Not entirely unlike a US IPA. Intense sweet roasty malt taste with caramelly alcoholic notes and orangey hops. Soft, full, smooth mouthfeel. Some alcohol heat. Sharpish resiny notes. Taste hasn&rsquo;t completely come together yet, it seems. Full roasty malty aftertaste with minty notes. Long lingering orangey malts taste. Good, with real subtlety and great sippability, but not a complete success. Have another bottle I&rsquo;ll rerate in a couple of years. (0.5l bottle, Alko, Helsinki.)",15
"Big brown coarseish head. Black opaque body is just barely translucent dark red. Malty sugary aroma with medicinal notes of raisins and licorice. Dryish-sweetish papery medicinal licorice taste with dried plum notes. Hollow-bodied, kind of watery. Dry papery peppery licorice aftertaste. Some grassy hops, too. Too thin and watery. (0.355l bottle, Systembolaget, G&#246;teborg.)",12
"Biggish offwhite head. Coppery body. Clean grassy peppery aroma with malt notes. Sweetish grassy malty taste with oily grainy notes. Rich, fullish body. Some fruit. Dry floral grassy aftertaste. Very nice for a pilsener. (0.5l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.)",13
"Big very white head. Yellow body. Clean, very light grainy peppery aroma. Dry papery taste, with a hint of sweetness, with grassy lemony peppery background. Mid-bodied. Light, clean mouthfeel, with light dust. No separate aftertaste. Not at all bad, but a bit watery and light. (0.5l can, shop, Charlottenberg.)",11
"Biggish very white shiny head. Yellow body. Grainy rubbery aroma with lemony notes. Dry lightly acidic grainy and rubbery taste with grassy peppery notes. Kind of thin body, but strangely that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Dusty, mealy mouthfeel joins up nicely with the grassy peppery taste. Quite harmonic and clean. Hints of lemon. Fades into watery grassy nothing. For 3.5% this is quite good. (0.5l can, shop, Charlottenberg.)",11
"Big offwhite coarseish shiny head does not last. Golden body with light carbonation. Yeasty bready aroma with soapy citric notes. Dry and lightly acidic watery grainy taste with citric notes. Watery metallic aftertaste. Not much of  a beer. (0.5l can, shop, Charlottenberg.)",8

"Biggish offwhite coarseish head. Light coppery body. Bready dough aroma with grassy notes. Dry-sweet grassy caramel taste with bready notes. Some fruitiness. Paper dominates initially, fading later. Lightly dusty, sharpish mouthfeel. Dry grassy papery aftertaste. A decent industrial pilsener, but forgettable. (0.5l can, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.)",11
"Medium coarseish offwhite head. Amber body. Strong harmonic aroma of papery caramel with notes of modelling clay. Dryish kind of sharp papery caramel taste dominates all the way through the aftertaste. Light and mild mouthfeel somewhat obscured by the sharpness of the taste. Minty grassy notes and some fruity straw can be made out. Dry papery caramel aftertaste settles in the mouth, making me want to rinse it. If this were a little less sharp and papery it would be a nice beer. Interestingly, when the beer warms the sharp papery taste becomes less prominent (without disappearing), making the beer more balanced, and citrus notes appear. Becomes more delicate, too. Bitterish aftertaste. (0.75l bottle from Fine Foods at Kastrup airport.)",12
"Medium white head. Yellow body. Harmonic rubbery herbal fruity aroma. Dry rubbery floral herbal taste. Dry orangey aftertaste. Some component in this taste really did not appeal to me, but I can&rsquo;t identify it. (0.25l draft at the brewpub.)",8
Medium white head. Amber body. Floral tropical fruit hop aroma with mealy straw notes. Dry-sweet dusty roasty wooden malt taste with burnt floral hop notes. Sharpish mouthfeel. Dry dusty burnt grain aftertaste with floral dandelion notes. Nice&#033; (0.2l taster at the brewpub.),13

"Small pinkish head. Deep ruby red body with vigorous carbonation and fruit particles. Highly unusual aroma. Fruity wooden cherry yoghurt aroma, thin and mild. Dry-sweet wooden cherry taste, quite tart. Thin-bodied. Dry-tart wooden cherry aftertaste. Nice, mellow. (0.75l bottle given by Hildig&#246;ltur at plan b, Copenhagen.

"Medium offwhite head does not last. Hazy almost opaque amber body. Vinegary yeasty aroma. Acidic vinegar taste with fruity citric notes. Aftertaste is the same, and a bit short. Not my cup of tea, because I wouldn&rsquo;t put vinegar in my tea. Or in my beer. (0.1l taster at EBF &rsquo;08.)",9
Medium offwhite head doesn&rsquo;t last. Amber body. Mild fruity aroma with grainy notes. Sweetish fruity honeyish taste with sugary roasty notes. A bit fizzy. Feels unclean. Dry roasty fruity aftertaste. (0.1l taster from bottle at EBF &rsquo;08.),11
Smallish light brown head. Hazy opaque dark brown body. Served much too cold. Sugary roasty sodapop aroma with honey and plum notes. Dry fruity burnt bubblegum taste. Dry roasty notes linger. Mid- to thin body. Quite mild. Some hops in the aftertaste. Well. Not great. (0.1l taster at EBF &rsquo;08.),11
Medium offwhite head. Amber body with light carbonation. Yeasty strawberry aroma with notes of straw and malts. Dry-sweet spicy yeasty taste with herbal notes. Unclean. Bitter orangey aftertaste. Not great. (0.1l taster draft at EBF &rsquo;08.),11
"Medium white head. Orangey body. Intense citric catty hop aroma with orangey notes. Intense bitter chalky catty rubbery taste. Aftertaste is the same. Unbalanced, with only catty bitterness, and nothing else on offer. In order to become a balanced beer it needs to also have something pleasant in the taste. (0.3l draft at Pegasus, Copenhagen. Thanks to KnutAlbert.)",9
"Small pink head. Deep red body with small particles. Strong raspberry juice aroma. Not a lot else. Sweetish yoghurty intense raspberry taste. Taste settles into the mouth. Very good&#033; (0.25l bottle at Pegasus, Copenhagen.)",15
"Small brown head. Opaque black body. Minty roasty aroma with chocolate notes. Dry-sweet chocolatey earthy sherry taste with alcohol notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Dryish chocolate aftertaste. Nice. (0.1l taster from bottle, EBF &rsquo;08.)",14

"Small dark brown head does not last. Opaque black body. Citric tropical fruit aroma. WTF? Is this an oaked imperial stout or an IPA? No wonder the guy at the stand offered me this instead when they were out of the Cascade IPA. Dry-sweet oaked cocoa taste with citric hoppy notes and a minty background. Some alcohol as well. Dry cocoa finish with caramel and sherry notes. The taste is a lot more imperial stout-like. Nice, but could probably be more oaked and aged. (0.1l taster from bottle at EBF &rsquo;08.)",15
"Medium coarseish brown head. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Earthy roasty licorice aroma with notes of plums. Dry-sweet powerful roasty earthy fruity licorice taste with alcoholic burnt chocolate notes. Balanced and harmonic. Dry earthy wooden fruity licorice aftertaste. Very, very nice. (0.1l taster from cask at EBF &rsquo;08.)",16
"Small white head. Pale golden body. Light undefined tropical fruit hop aroma. Dry citric tropical fruit hop taste, deep and complex. Light, easy to drink. Dry long aftertaste of same. Some sweetness. Very nice&#033; (0.1l taster draft at EBF &rsquo;08.)",15
"Thin dark brown head. Opaque black body. Subdued coffee and marzipan aroma with alcohol notes. Intense bitter-sweet coffee taste with alcoholic wild berry notes. Strong alcohol heat starts burning towards the end. Bitter coffee aftertaste. Strange. Where is the complexity? Feels like the bitter alcohol has burned it away, so that other tastes cannot be made out. Needs to mature further. &#40;0.5l bottle, wine monopoly.&#41;  Second rate: Same visuals. Thick coffeeish oily chocolatey aroma with alcoholic toffee and sherry notes. Sweet coffee and chocolate taste with strong alcohol notes. The alcohol taste keeps growing and eventually overpowers the beer entirely. This needs to mature. Will rerate from bottle in November. &#40;0.05l taster draft at EBF &#8217;08.&#41;  First rating: From an unlabeled bottle in June. Back then it was mostly dominated by sharp coffee, which seems to have mellowed a lot by now. The alcohol was much less noticeable back then.",14
"Medium white lasting head. Yellow body. Fruity citric orangey grassy hoppy aroma with mealy notes. Dry-sweet orangey mealy taste with floral hoppy notes. Light body, refreshing. Dry floral hoppy orangey aftertaste. This is a pilsener? Seems more like a pale ale to me. A good one, though. (0.1l taster from bottle, EBF &rsquo;08.)",14
"Small white head. Hazy orange body. Faintly rubbery yeasty citric aroma. Dry rubbery yeasty citric taste with fruity notes. Aftertaste is much the same. Picked this because it&rsquo;s a broyhan, despite it being Kongens Bryghus, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem very like historical broyhan to me. In any case not very interesting. (0.1l taster draft at EBF&rsquo;08.)",11
Small white head immediately disappears. Deep golden body. Grainy honeyish aroma with citric notes. Dry-sweet watery honeyish citric hop taste with fruity notes. Dry chalky aftertaste. Not bad. (0.1l taster at EBF&rsquo;08.),13
Big beige shiny lasting head. Amber body. Light hoppy aroma. Dryish roasty mealy taste with fruity hop notes. Mid-to-thin body. No real aftertaste. Boring. (0.1l taster at EBF &rsquo;08.),10
"Medium offwhite head leaves dense lace. Amber body. Sugary fruity aroma with yeasty notes. Sweet sugary fruity taste, kind of thin and light, with an underlying uncleanness. Light roastiness, too. (0.1l taster draft at EBF&rsquo;08.)",11
Small light brown head. Deep brownish red body. Deep strong earthy caramelly malt aroma with roasty oily toffee notes and traces of wild berries. Dry-sweet roasty caramelly taste with earthy notes. Light mouthfeel. Chocolatey toffee can also be noted. Sweetish wooden caramel finish with minty notes. Lovely&#033; (0.1l taster from bottle at EBF&rsquo;08.),16
"Big coarseish offwhite head. Amber body with vigorous carbonation. Chalky citric hop aroma with tropical fruit notes. Yeasty sharp fizzy hoppy barnyard taste with citric tropical fruit notes. Some phenol as well. Dry sharpish dandelion aftertaste. Not bad, but certainly not perfect, either. (0.1l taster at EBF&rsquo;08.)",12
"Small white head. Yellow body with very light carbonation. Watery grain aroma with notes of straw and floral hops. Dry watery grainy straw taste with floral hop notes. Some sweetness. Slightly harsh mouthfeel. Not bad, but apart from the extra aroma hops, this is a standard eurolager. (0.1l taster from bottle on EBF&rsquo;08.)",11
"No head. Deep dark red body. Sweet roasty cinnamon fruit and weird caramel aroma. Dry-sweet oaked roasty caramel taste, slightly watery. Very harmonic, balanced, and delicate. The aroma was great, but the taste is too short. (0.1l taster at EBF&rsquo;08, thanks to Beer_2000.)",12
"Small offwhite head. Hazy orange body. Orangey (tangerine, perhaps?) citric hop aroma, maybe a little one- dimensional. Dry-sweetish sharpish orangey citric hop taste. Real orangey edge makes the beer refreshing. Could have had more depth, though. (0.1l taster draft at EBF&rsquo;08.)",12
"What little head there is is a coarse black foam around the edge. Deep red body, faintly hazy. Open spicy yeasty aroma with notes of juniper twigs, roasty malts, banana, and faint alcohol. Dry roast spicy wooden taste with bananaish notes. Some fruitiness. Delicate and light-bodied. Dry chalky aftertaste with some roastiness. (0.1l taster draft at EBF&rsquo;08.)",13
"Medium brown head. Completely opaque black gody. Sugary alcoholic dired fruit aroma with oak notes. Sweet alcoholic whiskey taste with wooden burnt notes and lots of chocolate. Dry whiskey aftertaste. Some alcohol heat. I hate whiskey, so this wasn&rsquo;t for me. (0.1l taster, EBF 08.)",11
Medium brown head does not last. Deep red body. Sweet chocolate and dried fruit aroma with alcohol notes. Dryish fruity fusel alcohol taste with rock candy and plum notes. A bit burnt. Dry estery banana chocolate aftertaste. Yuck. (0.1l taster draft at EBF 08.),9
"No head. Yellow body. Watery fruity hoppy aroma. Dry straw and grain taste with hoppy perfumy notes. Dry mealy floral hop aftertaste. Not much use for this. (0.1l taster from bottle, EBF 08.)",12
"No head. Amber body. Sugary malty aroma. Dryish sugary watery taste with roasty notes. No aftertaste. Well, this wasn&rsquo;t anything much. (0.1l sampler from bottle at EBF08.)",7
"Medium coarse offwhite head does not last. Hazy dark amber body. Deep citrusy mango hop aroma. Sweet intense citrusy tropical fruit taste with wooden roasty pine needle notes. Oily sharp mouthfeel. Bitter hoppy aftertaste lingers. Leaves sticky sugars on the lips. (0.1l cask taster, EBF08.)",16
"Medium white head. Hazy pale yellow body with carbonation. Estery unfresh yeasty aroma with spicy coriander and flour notes. Dry sharp fruity hop tastewith mealy spicy notes. Light-bodied. Some paper in the aftertaste. Easy to drink. Not bad. (0.1l taster, EBF08.)",12
"Medium very white head does not last. Copper body. Wet cardboard and pumpernickel aroma. Lightly acidic pumpernickel and cardboard taste with medicinal notes. Dryish aftertaste of nothing. Some sweetness. Watery body, harsh mouthfeel. Not too in-your-face unpleasant. (0.33l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.)",6
"Medium very white head does not last. Yellow body. Papery straw aroma with medicinal grapefruit notes. Dry sharp grapefruit taste with papery medicinal notes. Thin-bodied and sharp mouthfeel. Dry empty aftertaste. Useless. (0.33l bottle, Maxi Mat, Charlottenberg.)",6
"Big white head does not last. Deep copper body. Thin caramelly paper aroma. Dry and faintly acidic paper taste with grainy chalky notes. A faint fruitiness hides in the background. Harsh, dusty mouthfeel. Dry faintly citric aftertaste with metallic notes. Aroma hops my ass. Great to see these brewers doing something other than the usual pale lager, but when it&rsquo;s this bad it&rsquo;s hard to see the point. I&rsquo;d rather have their pilsener than this. Why, oh why, did I buy two cans for this? Drainpour. (0.5l can, Centra, Oslo.)",7
"Medium very white head. Yellow body. Straw and earthy caramel aroma with notes of dusty office corridors and a trace of paper. Sweetish earthy papery caramel taste with floral hop notes. Clean, mild mouthfeel. Mid-bodied. Dry metallic earthy aftertaste lingers. Quite an achievement for a gluten-free. (0.33l bottle, Centra, Oslo.)",11
"Big shiny very white head. Hazy yellow body with light carbonation. Neutral fruity wheat aroma with herbal notes. Sweetish wheaty indeterminate fruit taste with citric herbal notes and some toffee. Light, clean, chalky mouthfeel. Long dryish mlky herbal afterttaste. A bit different, and not so bad. (0.33l bottle, Centra, Oslo.)",11
"Biggish brown head. Deep dark translucent red body. Sugary caramelly pine sap aroma with lingonberry and cinnamon notes. Wonderfully harmonic and balanced. Dry-sweet-acidic taste of tyttebær and pine sap with powerful hoppy herbal notes. Aftertaste adds dry hops fading into a harsh wooden taste with metallic notes. Great balance and harmony, but quite tough to drink, even though the taste isn&rsquo;t too overpowering. Sharpish mouthfeel, and kind of hollow-bodied. Extremely unusual, and something of a challenge to drink. Certainly quite far removed from the ordinary conception of beer. (0.5l  bottle, Bar&Cigar, Oslo. No batch no.)",14
"Medium offwhite head. Yellow body with light carbonation. Rubbery grainy aroma with sugary notes. Dry-sweet sugary mealy grainy taste. Harsh dusty mouthfeel, which I did not like. Dry grassy aftertaste with papery notes. Not a good beer. (0.33l can from Knut Albert, labelled Union Svetlo Pivo.)",8
"Biggish white head disappears, leaving uneven lumpy islands of foam. Yellow body with carbonation. Rubbery straw aroma with hoppy (wow&#033;) notes. Dry milky rubbery straw taste with chalky hop notes. Surprisingly clean palate. Dry papery hop aftertaste leaves lingering cardboard taste. Not at all bad for an alcohol-free. (0.5l can from Knut Albert, labelled Union Bezalkoholno Pivo.)",8
"Biggish white head with some bigger bubbles. Yellow body with carbonation. Rubbery grainy aroma with mealy sugary notes. Dry-acidic unclean grainy sugary taste with rubbery notes. Dry papery maize aftertaste lingers. This was unpleasant. Didn&rsquo;t finish it. (0.33l bottle, Wine Monopoly.)",7
"Big offwhite shiny head leaves lacing as it slowly subsides. Brass body. Grassy rubbery aroma with milky sugar notes. Dry-acidic grainy rubbery taste with milky notes.

Dry roasty earthy cinnamon taste with a background sweetness. Hoppy licorice notes. Dry roasty earthy wild berry aftertaste with chocolatey notes. Nice, flavourful, and harmonic.

"Medium coarseish beige head. Hazy brownish dark red body. Malty papery aroma with cinnamon and wild berry notes. Estery, earthy notes, too. Dry earthy cinnamon taste with roasty malty notes. Some black chocolate, too. Clean, harmonic palate. A bit astringent. Dry estery hoppy aftertaste lingers. Nice, and quite unusual, since it&rsquo;s so dry. (0.33l bottle, Alko, Helsinki.)",13
"Big beige lasting head. Deep red body. Roasty fruity cinnamon aroma with citric pine needle hop notes. Dry-sweet citric tropical fruit hop taste with roasty malty pine needle hop notes. Sharpish bitter mouthfeel. Dry-acidic burnt pine needle aftertaste with vinegary alcohol and pepper notes. Harmonic, but lacks complexity, and tastes mildly spoilt.

"Big beige head. Deep dark red translucent body. Sweet malty aroma with earthy toffee and floral hop notes. Dry-sweet roasty earthy malt taste with chocolate notes. Soft, mild mouthfeel, with what feels like mild alcohol burn (at 5.3%?). Dry burnt earthy aftertaste. Very nice&#033; (0.5l bottle, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)",13
"Biggish coarseish white head does not last. Cloudy orange body. Thin chalky bananaish aromawith spicy oily herbal notes. Dryish herbal wheaty yeasty taste with chalky banana notes. Dry grassy banana notes. Dry grassy banana aftertaste with grapefruit notes. Mid-to-thin-bodied, rounds out when more yeast is added. Not bad. (0.5l bottle, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)",12
"Big offwhite shiny lasting head. Copper body with carbonation. Alcoholic grassy maize and butterscotch aroma with sugary toffee notes. Alcohol warmth is the first impression of the taste. Then: malty oily grassy taste with fruity alcoholic notes. Some chalk as well. Dry alcoholic aftertaste. (0.33l can, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)",9
"Big very white head. Yellow body with carbonation. Fruity straw aroma with grassy notes and some malts. Sweetish grainy straw and chalk taste with grassy vaguely alcoholic notes. Slightly harsh, yet faintly oily, mouthfeel. Light butterscotch. Dryish milky grassy aftertaste. Not bad. (0.5l bottle, Alko, Helsinki.)",11
"Medium coarseish white head quickly disappears completely. Deep golden body. Mild fruity alcoholic paint and toffee aroma with burnt sugar notes. Dry-sweet strawberry and gasoline taste with toffee notes. Considerable alcohol heat. Astringent, chalky. Aftertaste is roasty almonds and straw with alcohol notes and grassy hops. Minty notes. Very sweet throughout. Clean and surprisingly balanced, also quite complex. Interesting, but not a session beer, and not that great for sipping, either. (0.33l bottle, from some grocery store in Salzburg.)",13
"Big light beige head does not last. Leaves fine lace. Amber body. Peppery dried fruit and caramel aroma, understated, with roasty sugary notes. Dry-sweet roasty caramelly taste with grainy dried fruit notes. A bit lacking in body. Acidic smoky peppery aftertaste with licorice notes. Some chalk and ash. A roasty almonds taste settles and lingers. Not bad, but could be better. (0.5l bottle, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)",11
"Biggish very white shiny lasting head. Golden body. Clean fruity straw aroma with minty grassy notes. Dryish straw and fruit taste. Clean, soft mouthfeel. Harmonic and balanced. A bit chalky. Dry apple and grass aftertaste with minty notes and traces of oranges. Very nice. (0.5l bottle, Rewe, München.)",12

Vinuous fruity banana wheat aroma with orangey metallic hop notes and some breadiness. Sweetish-dry delicate roasty yoghurty wooden banana wheat taste with acidic smoky notes. Soft astringent mouthfeel. Balanced and harmonic. Dryish orangey metallic hops with grassy spicy peppery notes. Excellent&#033; One of the best weizens I&rsquo;ve had. (0.5l bottle, Rewe, München.)",14
"Medium coarse unstable white head quickly disappears altogether. Very pale yellow body with light carbonation. Sugary apple aroma with alcohol notes, quite clean. Sweet apple taste with metallic chemical notes. Much too sweet. Sweet mealy artificial apple taste lingers. Gah. (0.5l can.)",6
"Biggish beige lasting head. Deep dark red-brown body with light carbonation. Fruity roasty earthy aroma with notes of dried plums, caramel, and chocolate. Dry-sweet earthy dried plums taste with roasty malty chocolate notes. Dry metallic chocolate aftertaste kind of jars with the fruitiness. It&rsquo;s not bad, but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it much. (0.5l bottle, Centra, Oslo.)",11
"Medium offwhite fine-laced head. Pale coppery body with light carbonation. Strange aroma of wet cardboard and sugary citric coriander. Taste is malty coriander with cardboard and orange notes. Some roastiness, too. The aftertaste is the same, and very long. Really disliked this combination. Drain-pour&#033; Later I&rsquo;ve come to suspect that the cider I drank before this may have messed with my palate. Need to rerate. (0.5l bottle, Centra, Oslo.)",6
"Big white coarse unstable head quickly disappears entirely. Very pale yellow body with carbonation. Sugary apple aroma, somewhat artificial, but relatively clean. Very sweet artificial apple taste. Palate is sickly sweet. This is just way too sweet. Really a soft drink diluted with apple wine. Yuck. (0.5l can.)",5
"Medium coarseish white head quickly disappears entirely. Watery body with faint greenish tinge. Sweet sugary artificial pear aroma with traces of cardamom. The taste is much the same, with a strange metallic off taste, very sweet and artificial, leaves a thick pelt on the teeth. Awful. Basically an insult to the good name of perry. (0.5l can, Rema 1000, Oslo.)",4
"Huge light brownish head quickly develops huge bubbles. Deep barely translucent dark red body. Roasty wooden wet wool aroma with hoppy notes. Dry powerful roasty wooden caramel taste with nutty creosote notes, lightly perfumy. Some fruit and chocolate as well. Soft, clean mouthfeel. Hints of sourness. Dry astringent burnt minty wooden aftertaste. An excellent session beer. I&rsquo;m amazed by the amount of taste in this, given the alcohol. (0.5l bottle, Centra, Oslo.)",13
"Huge offwhite lasting head. Amber body with small particles and light carbonation. (This beer&rsquo;s travelled for almost two weeks in my suitcase, and may be a little the worse for wear. Need to rerate.) Tropical fruit and bread aroma with citric hoppy floral notes. Dry-sweet resiny floral taste with tropical fruit and citrus notes. Slightly harsh mouthfeel. Dry ashy chalky aftertaste with metallic notes. Good, but perhaps a bit thin and harsh. (0.5l bottle, Irma, Kastrup.)",13

Peppery floral hops as well. Complex, harmonic, and balanced. Dry herbal, spicy, yeasty taste with fruity citric notes. Dry mealy citric hoppy aftertaste with grapefruit notes. Taste is a bit edgy, mouthfeel is sharp (in bottle, on cask it was soft and smooth), and body mid. One of the better weizens I&rsquo;ve had, since it&rsquo;s not a typical weizen at all. (0.5l bottle, batch #151, ICA Supermarked, Oslo. Also rated once from cask at Bar & Cigar, Oslo.)",14
"Medium offwhite head. Amber body with vigorous carbonation. Roasty buttery malts aroma with the characteristic grainy, rubbery Grans notes as well as grassy toffee traces. Dry-sweet grainy grassy taste with roasty malty notes and some dried fruit. Light, soft mouthfeel. Dry-acidic grainy aftertaste. Clean palate, and yet some vaguely disturbing acidic-grainy notes. Obviously the best Grans so far, but still not very good. (0.33l bottle, Rema 1000, Oslo.)",10
"Big beige head subsides slowly. Dark red barely translucent body with carbonation. Clean malty fruity aroma with papery wild berry notes and light roasty licorice. Harmonic and nice, but a bit faint. Sweet-dry earthy licorice taste with papery wild berry notes and a slightly perfumy character. Mouthfeel is clean, soft, and smooth. Mid-to-full body. Dry roasty licorice aftertaste with peppery wild berry notes. Very nice&#033; (0.5l bottle, Rewe supermarket, München.)",13
"Big offwhite shiny head. Hazy yellow body. Floral earthy yeasty aroma with mealty, mealy, peppery notes. Clear, clean aroma. Delicate dry-sweet floral taste with fruity yeasty notes. Soft, smooth chalky mouthfeel, clean and fresh. Mid-bodied. Dry mealy slightly papery and dusty fruit aftertaste. A very good beer. (0.5l bottle, Rewe supermarket, München.)",15
"Medium beige head. Amber body. Deep harmonic fruity floral aroma with strawberry notes. Dry-sweet dusty malty taste with fruity floral notes. Soft, clean mouthfeel with some dust. Smooth. Mid-bodied. Dry roasty smoky strawberry aftertaste. The smokiness lingers for a long time. Very nice&#033; (0.5l draft at the brewpub.)",13
"Medium shiny white head quickly disappears. Yellow body with light carbonation. Light clean floral dusty aroma. Dryish dusty floral taste with fruity straw and grain notes. Some sweetness, too. Mid-bodied. Clean palate. Dry dusty grainy aftertaste with faint fruity notes. Quite nice. (0.5l draft at brewpub.)",12

Dry-sweet papery malty taste with roasty wild berry notes as well as plums. Full, slightly oily body. Dryish malty roasty licorice aftertaste with peppery notes.

"Medium offwhite shiny head. Amber body. Bready fruity floral aroma with perfumy butterscotch, cinnamon, and cardamom notes. Dry-sweet cardamom and cinnamon taste with bready cocos notes. Dry roasty vanilla aftertaste. A very odd beer, primarily because of the spices. Quite nice, though. (0.5l bottle as a gift from a blog reader.)",12
"Big bright shiny white lasting head. Light golden body. Clean malty peppery apple aroma with grassy floral hop notes. Dry-sweet grassy apple and pepper taste with floral notes. Quite full-bodied.

"Big offwhite lasting head. Coppery yellow body. Clean malty neutral aroma with faint peppery hops. Traces of rubber. Dry-sweet light malty corn taste. Sharp fizzy mouthfeel. Dry rubbery watery corn aftertaste with grainy notes. Bland. (0.5l can, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)",9

Thin-bodied with a strange palate. Some acidity. (Hmmmm.) Dryish strawberry alcohol aftertaste. Yuck&#033; This was awful. Is it meant to be this way, or is it infected?

"Big offwhite head. Coppery body. Softly nutty metallic roasty malts aroma. Dry-sweet nutty malty taste with rubbery notes. Fizzy mouthfeel, mid-bodied. Bitter dandelion aftertaste with nalty notes. It&rsquo;s OK. (0.5l bottle, Co-op, Ballycastle, Ulster.)",12

"Huge beige lasting head. Brown body with yeast particles. Caramelly straw aroma with dusty papery hoppy notes. Dry-sweet intense caramelly malty nutty taste with grainy straw and alcohol notes. Some papery roastiness, too. Full-bodied soft and smooth with lots of carbonation. Clean. Dry hoppy straw caramel malt aftertaste is loong. Minty notes. Very sweet, but balanced by lots of hops. Leaves sticky sugar on lips. Very nice. (0.5l bottle from gr0ve.)",16
"Thin coarse brownish head. Opaque brown body with yeast sludge at the bottom. Wooden vinuous banana and licorice aroma with yeast, honey, and alcohol notes. Dry-sweet fruity roasty alcoholic taste with wooden yeasty bananaish notes. Thin-bodied. Dry acidic wooden grainy metallic barnyard aftertaste. Not a success. Might have been stored improperly. (0.275l bottle from gr0ve.)",11
"Small brown coarseish head. Opaque black body. Vinuous chocolatey alcoholic fruity aroma with roasty burnt notes. Aroma is in fact rather like a chocolate with fruit liquor inside. Vinuous chocolatey fruity taste with roasty plum and alcohol notes. Full-bodied with some alcohol heat. Dry roasty papery alcoholic medicinal aftertaste. Lovely aroma, but the taste is nowhere near as successful. (0.5l bottle, City Beverage Co, London.)",13
Small beige coarse head. Darkish amber body. Honey and dried fruit aroma with papery wild berry notes. Dry-sweet slightly watery burnt plum and fruit taste with papery honeyish notes. Light-bodied. Dry papery caramelly honey and plum aftertaste. Nice&#033; (0.33l bottle from gr0ve.),13

"Biggish offwhite lasting head. Hazy copper brown body. Roasty malty wooden medicinal aroma with nutty sugary notes. Dry nutty medicinal malty taste with wooden tea notes. Light-bodied and clean. Dry minty aftertaste. Nice, but a bit on the light and boring side; could use more complexity. Could do without the sugar, too, to give it more body. (0.5l bottle, Co-op, Ballycastle, Ulster.)",12
"Thin very coarse white head does not cover the beer entirely. Hazy opaque amber body. Syrupy banana rye aroma with cloves, perfume, and alcohol notes. Also traces of juniper, wood, and grass. Very complex and quite fascinating. Sweetish grainy sugary rye and juniper taste with oily banana and cloves notes. Full-bodied and open palate with some alcohol heat. Aftertaste has yeast and alcohol. No real aftertaste. (0.5l bottle, Arkadia Alko, Helsinki.)",12
"Small thin white head does not last. Slightly hazy yellow body. Malty medicinal aroma with golden hoppy notes. Dry papery medicinal malty taste with floral hoppy notes. Light body. Dry powerfully papery hoppy resiny aftertaste. Not bad, but definitely not a great beer. (0.5l bottle, City Beverage Co, London.)",11
"Biggish offwhite lasting head. Hazy opaque paleish orangey body. Citric yoghurty aroma with bananaish, bready, milky notes. Sweetish chalky vaguely fruity bananaish taste with citric yeasty notes.

"Big shiny lasting offwhite head. Paleish yellow body. Straw and rubber aroma with milky mealy notes. Dry watery milky potato-like grainy taste. Harsh dusty mouthfeel. Bitter watery dandelion aftertaste. Well, it&rsquo;s drinkable, and not much worse than water. (0.33l can from gr0ve.)",7
"Huge lasting head of unevenly sized bubbles. Hazy opaque dark brown body. Mild smoky meaty aroma with salty wheaty banana notes. Very harmonic and unusual. Dry smoky yeasty taste, quite mild, develops wheaty bananaish notes in the aftertaste which also has some roastiness and licorice. Very fizzy mouthfeel, maybe even a bit too fizzy. Sharpish in the aftertaste, probably from carbonation. Interesting, but can&rsquo;t say it appeals all that much. (0.5l bottle, Vinmonopolet.)",12
"Big beige head. Hazy red-amber body. Intense citric tropical fruit aroma with notes of mango and malts. Dry malty citric tropical fruit taste with light catty notes. Some sweetness, too.

Very long aftertaste. Lovely, a powerful beer to sip. (0.5l, Vinmonopolet.)",15

"Big dark brown lasting head. Opaque black body goes dark red at edges. Sugary roasty milky chocolatey aroma with wooden notes. Dry-sweet dark chocolatey roasty taste with licorice notes. Feels surprisingly light. Mid-bodied. Dry coffeeish roasty laquer and burnt wood aftertaste. Leaves sticky sugar on the lips. Very good, and dangerously easy to drink. (0.5l bottle from Ole_R.)",15
"Medium offwhite head. Hazy amber body. Vague grainy fruity aroma with strawberry notes. Dry wooden roasty fruity taste. A bit fizzy. Dusty, mealy mouthfeel. Faint alcohol notes.

Medium offwhite head does not last. Hazy orangey body. Floral fruity tomato vinegar aroma. Dry acidic peas and vinegar taste. Not much else going on. Clearly infected. Yuck&#033; (0.5l bottle from Ole_R. Must rerate.),2
"Medium beige head does not last. Nearly opaque dark red body goes translucent near edges. Sweetish vinuous wooden yoghurty aroma with notes of wild berries and alcohol. Sour wooden vinuous wild berry and cherry taste. Some sweetness, but the tart sourness really dominates. (Strange. I remember the sample we tried at the brewery two months ago as much sweeter.) Thin-bodied. Dry-sweet-sour cherry wood and lingonberry aftertaste. Sharp tart metallic vinuous sourness lingers. An extreme beer that&#8217;s pretty tough to drink, but definitely an excellent beer.

BBD 2009-08-14.)",15

Dry-sweet spicy licorice and bubblegum taste with minty herbal notes. Mid-bodied.  Mild, slightly hot mouthfeel.  Dry earthy bubblegum and dried fruit aftertaste with spicy herbal roasty notes.

Hazy deep amber body with powerful carbonation. Sharp fruity spicy aroma with malty peppery notes. Sweetish spicy peppery taste with fruity malty notes.

"Medium brown lasting head. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Roasty tropical fruit aroma, rather faint. Dry-sweet roasty wooden tropical fruit taste, rather delicate (if one can say that of something so powerful) and well balanced, with chocolatey oily notes. Traces of wood (teak?) and perfume.

Dry-sweet resiny chocolatey taste with some sweetness and alcoholic coffee notes. Quite a bit of bubblegum, too. Dry roasty chocolate aftertaste.

"Medium white coarseish head. Paleish yellow body. Resiny straw aroma with fruity notes and some roasted almonds. Dry-sweet roasted almonds and dry straw taste with resiny notes. Dusty mouthfeel. Dry grainy chalky aftertaste.   The owner of Tre Små Rum (Reza) gave me a sample from bottle as well, to go with the draft version I ordered. That had a lot more aroma with more emphasis on fruit and malts. The taste was not more powerful than from draft, but showed the same difference in emphasis. The bottled version was also lightly acidic and rubbery. I preferred the draft version.  (0.3l draft at Tre Små Rum, Göteborg.)",13
"Medium beige head does not last. Yellow body with carbonation. Fruity citric citric aroma with malts and strawberry notes. Dry-sweet malty citric taste with fruity roasty strawberry  notes.

"Medium white head. Light amber body with carbonation. Powerful resiny fruity aroma with floral citric notes and some dusty malts. Sharp dry-sweet floral dusty hops taste with an acidic vinegary aftertaste. Acid is mild, but definitely there. Probably a good beer without this. (0.25l draft at Olutkellari, Helsinki. Bartender admits to vinegary flavour, but says all their 10 casks have had it. Offered to give me another beer for free. Have to rerate this to see if I can find it without vinegar.)",7

Dryish sweetish mealy yeasty floral taste with banana notes. Sharpish mouthfeel, probably from carbonation in the mouth. No real aftertaste, just perfumy traces of ash and milk.

"Medium offwhite head. Coppery body. Fain grainy malty aroma with faint roastiness and cardboard. Somewhat stale. The aroma is strongest initially, then fades. Dry grainy caramelly taste with a sweetish background. Burnt taste hovers above it from start to finish and lingers pretty much forever. Oily yet harsh mouthfeel. Chalky. Strange.

Dry-sweet intensely spicy taste with much the same character, but also malts, fruit, and banana. Dry feeling settles in the mouth.

"Medium white head. Hazy yellow body. Sharpish fruity spicy aroma with notes of pepper, grains of paradise, and soft metal. Sharpish fruity chalky taste with spicy notes and a touch of banana.

Deep sweet roasty fruity caramel and chocolate taste with fruity bready notes. Harmonic. Some alcohol heat is noticeable, unsurprisingly. Very full-bodied.

A touch of alcohol, too. Dry peppery, spicy hoppy aftertaste with notes of tea. Some alcohol heat. Good, but the alcohol is maybe a bit prominent, making the taste seem slightly artificial.

"Medium light brown head. Slightly hazy deep red body. Sweet bubblegum, licorice, and candy aroma with alcoholic roasty malt notes. Wild berry and earthy licorice taste. Dryish chocolatey licorice aftertaste is perhaps the strongest taste. Overall there is surprisingly little taste and depth, though. As you drink, the chocolate comes to dominate more and more. Mild, cool mouthfeel. Not bad, but disappointing for such a strong beer. (0.33l bottle, de Gekraakte Kettel, Amsterdam. BBD Aug '09.)",13
"Huge light brown shiny lasting head. Good cling. Deep red barely translucent body, made hazy from floaties. Deep sweet harmonic aroma is a mix of alcohol, wild berries, and licorice, surprisingly light, with earthy, herbal notes. Frist impression is licorice and chocolate, but very thin, followed by soapy, peppery notes. Some herbs and earth, too. There is very little taste, though, and it feels strangely light and thin, and even a bit acidic. Seems like it was most likely lightly infected in the bottle. Should rerate.

"Big offwhite fine-laced head. Amber body with floating particles. (Uh oh, is this bottle old? Rated a second one, same thing. That's probably two old bottles.) Delicate toffeeish caramelly aroma with nutty notes. Sweetish roasty toffeeish taste with resiny, medicinal notes. (Yeah, it&#8217;s old. Second one had less emphasis on the medicine and more on the resin.) Dry caramelly aftertaste. Good. (0.341l bottle at Bishop&#8217;s Arms, Avenyn, Göteborg. Probably past sell-by date, but can&#8217;t find any date marking on the bottle. Probably on the cap, which the barkeep has. Should rerate. Tried rerating at Beer Palace, Oslo, also with disappointing results.)",14
"Small brown lasting head. Opaque black body. Sweet perfumy licorice aroma with roasty malty notes. Dry-sweet dusty licorice taste with delicate peppery hop notes. Sooty, with spicy hops.

"Medium offwhite head. Amber body with light carbonation. Delicate sweet roasty toffeeish aroma with caramel, pepper, and gingerbread notes. Sweet roasty caramelly taste with burnt toffee notes. Earthy, smoky background. Oily mouthfeel. Faintly dry-and-sweet aftertaste, almost a bit cloying in its sweetness, with grassy hops. Good, but too sweet, and lacking in character.

"Medium brown head. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Milky oaty chocolate aroma with burnt notes and some peppery hops. Sweetish oaty burnt chocolate taste, slightly watery. Some acidity. Soapy, pepperynotes. Aftertaste again has peppery hops, and some wood. Not bad, but not a complete success, either. Good for such a light beer, though. (0.5l bottle at Tre Små Rum, Göteborg.)",13

Some fruity, caramelly, and grainy notes as well. Aftertaste is the same with herbal notes. Nice, but not a typical weizen. (0.33l draft at the brewpub.)",12
"Biggish offwhite lasting creamy head with good cling. Deep amber body. Sweetish fruity caramelly grainy aroma with spicy hoppy notes. Dry-sweet grainy reinsy taste with roasty, tangy caramelly notes. Something smoky in the background, it seems. Also delicate, but a bit harsher than the pilsener. Still very good. (0.33l draft at the brewpub. They said they keep changing the recipe and even style of this beer. This one they referred to as an amber ale.)",13
"Medium white creamy head. Copper body. Delicate spicy fruity caramelly aroma with roasty notes. Very harmonic and balanced. Dryish fruity roasty caramelly taste, very delicate. Clean, fresh mouthfeel. Dry spicy fruity aftertaste. Excellent! Too much dark malts for a normal pilsener, but still an excellent beer. (0.33l draft at the brewpub.)",14
"Medium beige head. Beautiful dark red body. Dusty roasty wild berry aroma with grassy notes. Dry roasty caramelly wild berry taste with meaty grass notes. Mid-bodied. Sharpish, dusty mouthfeel. Dry papery roasty aftertaste with grainy notes. Clean, fresh, some character, but not terribly interesting. &#40;0.33l bottle from some supermarket in Kiel. Rated twice.&#41;",11
Medium white coarseish head. Yellow body. Fruity grassy caramelly aroma with papery notes. Dry grassy caramelly taste with rubbery notes. Also fruity. Taste is quite dense. Aftertaste is much the same. Nice. (0.5l bottle.),12

Medium light beige head. Hazy amber body. Spicy banana licorice aroma with a light toffee caramel edge. Dry catty licorice and banana taste with herbal notes. Sharpish mouthfeel. Dry herbal licorice afteraste. (0.5l bottle from an anonymous benefactor. Want to rerate this when drinking a whole bottle.),14
"Big offwhite coarse head does not last. Deep copper body. Fruity malty aroma with caramelly notes. Dry fruity watery taste with roasty caramelly notes. Thin-bodied. Dry roasty caramelly aftertaste. Reasonably clean, but not too exiciting. (0.5l can from yngwie.)",10
"Medium shiny white head. Deep yellow body. Very mild malty yeasty aroma. Dry herbal grainy malty taste with faint fruitiness. Some sweetness. Dry herbal papery aftertaste. Decent, but no more. (0.33l bottle on the train to Lillehammer.)",9
"Smallish white head. Very pale yellow body. Lemony, rubbery aroma with detergent notes and a whiff of tobacco. Sweet rubbery lemony taste, very artificial. Papery notes. Kind of neutral, like a soft drink. Not really too bad. (0.5l can from gr0ve.)",7
"Biggish offwhite head. Slightly hazy deep yellow amberish body with very light carbonation. Herbal, grassy toffee caramel aroma with buttery notes. Dry-sweet buttery herbal caramel taste with licorice notes. Aftertaste is much the same. Slightly muddy mouthfeel. Grassy taste lingers. Nothing in the taste is in any way reminiscent of Christmas, but it's not bad, just very strange. (0.33l bottle from the wine monopoly.)",11
"Big brown lasting head. Deep barely translucent brown head with light carbonation. Body is clear until the very last bit of the bottle is poured. Sweet chocolatey licorice aroma with roasty, dark wooden, resiny notes. Soft, dry milky earthy licorice taste with deep notes of roasty dark tropical wood and chocolate. Clean, mild mouthfeel. Dry aftertaste of wonderfully distinct and clear roasty wood with minty notes lingers for a long time. Leaves sticky sugars on the lips. This is just excellent! (0.33l bottle from the wine monopoly.)",17
"Medium coarseish white head does not last. Yellow body with light carbonation. Wooden yeasty apple aroma, quite mild. Dry-and-sweet wooden apple taste with metallic notes. Carbonates in the mouth, but still feels kind of slick in the mouth. Aftertaste is much the same, with more emphasis on the wood and metal. Slightly watery. Kind of one-dimensional, but not bad, and the wooden flavour adds some depth. (0.568l bottle from Meny.)",11
"Medium white shiny head. Copper body. Light clean apple and malt aroma, a bit faint. Dry slightly papery apple and malt taste with some sweetness. A touch watery while cold. Clean and fresh mouthfeel. Aftertaste is much the same, but a bit grassier. Overall a decent pale lager with little off taste. (0.5l can from Meny.)",10
"Big offwhite shiny head. Coppery body. Clean apple aroma with grassy hop notes. Sweetish apple and grain taste. Clean, soft mouthfeel. Faint fruity notes. Dry grassy metallic grain aftertaste with traces of hops. Not at all bad. Probably the best pale lager from Ringnes. (0.5l can from Meny.)",10
"Medium offwhite shiny head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light mealy apple aroma with papery notes. Dry papery metallic apple taste with yeasty notes. Medium body. Mild mouthfeel. Some medicinal, herbal notes, too, in the aftertaste. Faint buttery traces. Overall quite low on taste. Low on carbs, low on taste, some off tastes, I guess is the summary. Pointless, really. (0.5l can from Meny.)",8

Dry metallic straw taste with wooden, meaty notes. Medium body. Dry metallic milky aftertaste with hop notes. (Hops!?! In a Ringnes beer?!) Harsh dry metallic taste lingers. Not the worst of the Munkholm series. In fact, possibly the best. (0.5l can from Meny.)",8
"Smallish white head. Light amber body. Sweetish caramelly aroma with notes of straw, very faint. Sweetish straw and malts taste with faint fruity notes. A bit fruitier and warmer than a lager, but really quite similar. Some catty, rubbery notes. Aftertaste is dry and wooden without much news. Some chalkiness. It's all right, but a bit boring. (0.33l bottle at Cardinal.)",12
"Smallish offwhite head. Hazy amber body with fast carbonation. Fruity, yeasty wild berry aroma with yoghurty notes, somewhat artificial. Dry yoghurty wooden wild berry taste, again somewhat artificial. Mouthfeel a little watery. Aftertaste is much the same. Disappointing, and not really very enjoyable. (0.33l bottle at Cardinal.)",10
"Medium white shiny head. Light orange body. Intense medicinal tropical fruit hop aroma with papery citric notes. Powerful papery medicinal taste with tropical fruit hop notes and strong citricity. The medicinal flavour is really overpowering, and makes me like the beer a lot less. Sharpish mouthfeel. Dry intensely citric and medicinal aftertaste. Not really very successful in my book. (0.355l bottle at Cardinal.)",12
"Big brown lasting head with a coarse froth on top. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Fruity syrupy malty aroma with earthy hoppy notes as well as traces of alcohol. Sweet earthy licorice taste, surprisingly faint when cold, but improves as the beer warms. Develops a malty alcoholic bite when warmer. Clean, harmonic palate.

"Biggish offwhite head. Amber body with light carbonation. Light earthy caramel aroma with faint papery notes and some hops at the far back. Dry earthy caramel taste. Clean, sharpish mouthfeel. Bitter earthy caramel aftertaste with grassy hop notes and a touch of wood. Good, but the taste is very subdued. If there were more of it this could be really great; as it is it's OK. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",13
"Thin light brown head. Deep dark red translucent body. Sweet earthy caramel aroma with roasty malty grain notes. Very clean and harmonic. Sweet burnt earthy caramel taste with malty grain notes. Medium-to-thin mouthfeel. Clean and harmonic. Dry burnt sooty earthy aftertaste, a bit thin, with caramelly notes. Nice, and well made, but not very special. (0.33l bottle at Cardinal.)",12
"Big white shiny lasting head. Yellow body with very light carbonation and minor particles. Light aroma of apple and malts with mealy, grassy notes. Dry, lightly acidic, malty mealy taste with notes of apples and wood. Bitter, malty grassy aftertaste with papery, yeasty notes. Some acidity in the aftertaste, too. A bit too harsh and flawed for me, but not really horrible. (0.5l bottle from Star supermarket, Brasov, Romania.)",7
"Medium white head. Hazy opaque brown body. Chalky, yeasty, banana aroma with citric notes and hints of herbal licorice. Chalky yeasty banana taste with, again, citric herbal notes. Typical, soft wheaty mouthfeel with a kind of chalky feel to it. Dry, herbal, lemony aftertaste. Nice, but not terribly special. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",13
"Small white head. Slightly hazy orange body. Light floral, fruity aroma with resiny, lemony notes. Dry-sweet resiny lemony taste with notes of straw and caramel. Clear hop presence in this one. Aftertaste is the same. Nice, especially for such a light beer. Definitely defined by the hops. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal as On the Tiles.)",13
"Medium beige head. Almost entirely opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Roasty caramel aroma with earthy, licorice notes. Dry smoky chocolatey burnt taste with earthy notes. Very dry aftertaste. Ok, but kind of boring. (0.375l bottle at Cardinal.)",11
"Thin beige-brown head. Body appears to be opaque black. Fruity earthy licorice aroma with notes of dust. Sweet earthy licorice taste with fruity, wooden notes. Dry-sweet wooden licorice aftertaste, kind of stale and earthy. Very anonymous for such a strong beer. Kind of boring, really. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",12

Dry chalky faintly fruity malty taste with grassy hop notes. Lemony notes. Chalky, powdery mouthfeel. Dry grassy dandelion hop aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit muddy and boring. The hops make a good contribution, but don't stand out enough. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",12
"Thin beige head. Deep dark translucent brown body. Powerful, smoky, earthy, salty aroma with meaty notes, not entirely unlike a smoked salami. Dry smoky earthy taste with caramelly meaty notes, somewhat salty. Wooden, charcoal quality to the smoke taste, which is exceedingly clean and pure. Clean, sharpish mouthfeel. Hints of residual sweetness. Dry, drawn-out aftertaste of smoky, sooty burntness. Gorgeous! (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",17

Deep sweet fruity malty taste with strong resiny hop notes. Clean, fresh, smooth mouthfeel. Dry, floral, resiny aftertaste with malty notes. Taste is quite powerful.

Thin coarse brown head. Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Powerful licorice and anise aroma. Very sweet licorice and anise taste with a kind of stale feel to it. Notes of chocolate and roastiness. Considerable alcohol heat. Muddy mouthfeel. Feels flat due to the lack of carbonation. (0.33l bottle traded from Beer2000.),13
"Big shiny offwhite creamy head with larger bubbles. Light brown body. Sweetish nutty malt aroma with citric floral hop aroma. Sweetish, firm malty taste with a strong smoky flavour and nutty notes. Hoppy, watery, smoky, almost burnt, aftertaste. A bit one-dimensional, but good. (0.5l bottle. Rated 2006-11-11, moved after split.)",14
"Thin white head quickly disappears. Yellow body with light carbonation. Sulphury aroma with notes of fruit and eggs. Sweetish sulphury fruity taste with caramel notes. Slightly buttery mouthfeel. Dry mealy aftertaste rather like the main taste with chalky notes. This is undrinkable. It doesn't even really taste like beer. Gah. (0.5l PET bottle from Star supermarket, Brasov, Romania.)",4
"Medium white head disappears immediately, leaving just a thin white ring. Yellow body with carbonation. Apple and soft drink aroma. Sweetish apple, paper, and soft drink taste with fruity notes. Empty, slightly harsh mouthfeel. Bitter metallic papery watery apple aftertaste, kind of empty, which I really don't like. Faint grassy hop notes also discernible. Did not like this. (0.5l can from Meny.)",6
"Big shiny beige lasting head. Deep dark red body. Straw and grain aroma with notes of soft floral hops and caramel. Dry floral hop taste with notes of straw. Hints of residual sweetness. Sharpish mouthfeel. Medium-bodied. Bitter floral hop aftertaste with grain notes. Just a hint of the caramel and roastiness one would expect in a &quot;Bayer&quot;; it's really completely dominated by the hops, which I really like. One of the best non-alcohols I've had. (0.33l bottle from Meny.)",12
"Medium offwhite head shrinks quickly. Deep dark red body. Sweetish vinuous aroma of port and red berries with chocolatey notes. Sweet roasty chocolatey taste with port and red berry notes. Mild, clean mouthfeel. Dry, roasty chocolatey aftertaste. Maybe a bit on the sweet side for something with so little body and hops, but I really liked it. (0.5l bottle traded from Beer2000. BBD of June 2007.)",14
"Huge beige coarseish head. Deep amber body with carbonation. Light yeasty, bready aroma of licorice and cinnamon with peppery notes. Sweetish bready licorice taste with peppery notes and very faint hints of banana. A bit watery. Carbonates in the mouth, giving a sharpish feel. Dryish papery licorice aftertaste with hints of chocolate and wood. Boring and watery. (0.33l bottle from the wine monopoly.)",12
"Medium white coarse shiny head does not last. Yellow body. Fruity, rubbery aroma, kind of catty, very unusual. Dry, sharpish fruity, catty, rubbery aroma with paper and hop notes. I bet some of this is sulphur. Aftertaste is the same, except perhaps slightly more watery. Mouthfeel is sharpish and medium-bodied. This is very unusual, and probably does not appeal to many people, but I kind of liked it for some reason. (0.5l can from Star supermarket, Brasov, Romania.)",8
"Medium white shiny head. Deepish yellow body. Caramelly, bready aroma, kind of faint. Thin, acidic, dry watery grain and maize taste. Some faint sweetness in the background. Very thin mouthfeel, and a bit harsh, watery. Thin, dry, metallic, papery aftertaste with vegetable notes. Did not like this. (0.5l bottle from supermarket in Leipzig.)",6
"Big brown head. Deep dark red body with carbonation. Fruity, malty wild berry aroma with perfumy, meaty notes. Sweet fruity malty taste with papery meaty notes. Very unusual taste. Soft, mild mouthfeel. Light body. Dryish malty wild berry aftertaste, stil with the meatiness, as well as some hoppy notes. Quite sweet; lacks bitterness. Strange, and not really that good. &#40;0.5l can, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.&#41;",10
"Big shiny white head. Yellow body with light carbonation. Mealy rubbery hoppy aroma. Dryish-sweetish mealy slightly yeasty papery taste with metallic notes. Slightly fruity malty taste. Powdery candy feel to it. Not very nice. (0.5l bottle from KnutAlbert, labelled &quot;Ozujsko Specialno Svijtelo&quot;.)",8
"Medium white shiny head. Hazy opaque orangey body. Thin mealy aroma with hints of citrus, yeast, banana, and chalk. Papery, mealy, chalky yeast taste with notes of banana and citrus. Dry mealy aftertaste. Faint chocolatey notes. Sharpish mouthfeel throughout. A bit flat and boring, but not really flawed in any way. (0.5l bottle from Leipzig, probably Bauer brewery outlet. BBD of Nov 2007.)",11
"Huge white fine-laced head. Slightly hazy yellow body. Acidic vinegar aroma with hints of softly metallic hops and something that might perhaps have become a nice pilsener. Intensely acidic vinegar and vomit taste. As an example of how horribly awful beer can taste this is interesting, but it has no other virtues. You couldn't get drunk on it, because you couldn't drink it. You couldn't use it as roadfill, because the bottles would eventually break. And so on. I did two sips only, but still shudder at the memory. Well. If they get the infection under control this will be a completely different beer, so let's hope they do. (0.5l bottle from the wine monopoly. Batch #4.)",1
"Medium offwhite fine-laced haed. Hazy brown body. Ripe tropical fruit and grapefruit aroma with stale unidentifiable notes. Dry vinegary fruity stale taste with papery notes. Sharpish mouthfeel. Very thin-bodied. Some acidity. Didn't enjoy this too much. (Smaller taster from bottle at Bølgen & Moi, Oslo. This was batch #5, still a bit fresh. Previously rated batches #1 and #3, which were infected.)",12

Intensely sweet firm malty straw and caramel taste with grainy, grassy, fruity notes. Clean, sharpish, distinct palate. Dry sharpish grassy straw, grain, and malt aftertaste with minty notes. An excellent beer, clearly very well made. (0.5l bottle from the brewery shop, Leipzig.)",14
"Biggish white lasting head. Hazy opaque yellow body. Dense chalky wheaty aroma with citric yeast notes. Dense chalky fruity taste with citric, yeasty notes, very like the aroma. Sharpish, powdery mouthfeel. Something vaguely herbal in there, too. Somewhat dry. Spicy, chalky, wheaty aftertaste. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing too right, either. Overall quite one-dimensional. (0.5l bottle from Spozywczy, Krakow.)",11
"Rises gently out of the bottle on opening. Huge yellowish beige head, somewhat coarse, quickly shrinks. Reddish brown body. Sweetish spicy peppery fruity bready yeasty aroma, quite mild, but nice. Some alcohol, too. Sweet fruity caramelly vinuous fruity taste with alcoholic cinnamon notes. Faintly dry, but really rather sweet, vinuous fruity cinnamon aftertaste with roasty notes. Not bad, but perhaps a bit too sweet without enough else going on. Vaguely reminiscent of Belgian dubbels. (0.5l bottle from Spozywczy, Krakow.)",12
"Big yellowish beige head. Deep brownish body with small particles. Intense alcoholic aroma of wood, bread, dried fruit, pepper, and faintly metallic hops. Sharp licorice and chocolatey bread and fruit taste with dark wooden notes. Peppery, clean mouthfeel. Harmonic and complex. Considerable alcohol heat.

"Big shiny offwhite head. Hazy orange body with carbonation. Peachy citric mango hop aroma with catty oily notes. Aroma is basically dominated by the hops. Dry-sweet mango peach hop taste with very fruity straw and grain notes. Aftertaste is the same. Very powerful, but still fresh. Excellent! (0.75l bottle from Gamle Strand, Copenhagen.)",16
"No head. Deep dark red body. Cherry cardboard and wool aroma, nice and harmonic. Sweetish wool blanket and cottton cherry with cardboard and wood notes. Aftertaste is the same. Powerful and complex. Held up well to storage. (0.25l bottle with gr0ve. BBD of 2003.)",15
"Small slightly pink head. Deep slightly hazy red body. Cherry yoghurt aroma. Sourish cherry, wood, and yoghurt taste. Nice and harmonic. Not too exciting, but definitely decent. (0.25l bottle with gr0ve.)",12
"Biggish beige head. Deep dark red translucent body with carbonation. Sweetish mealy licorice and spice aroma with papery notes. Fruity catty notes. Dry licorice and rubbery catty fruity hop notes. Clearly way too dry for the type and for the rest of the taste, but this is probably not intentional. Dry chocolatey licorice aftertaste with notes of cinnamon. Not bad. (0.5l bottle with KnutAlbert.)",12
"Big dark beige head. Deep dark body, barely deep red translucent, hazy. Light smoky chocolate aroma. Dry roasty burnt chocolate and smoke taste. Slightly thin-bodied. Some notes of rye. Dry smoky slightly metallic aftertaste. Very nice! (0.5l bottle with KnutAlbert.)",15
"Biggish white head quickly shrinks. Slightly hazy amber body. Dry malty mealy aroma. Dry resiny malty papery lightly roasted taste. The hops are there, but too skewed towards the bitter; not enough aroma. Dry rubbery malty lightly roasted aftertaste. Lightly acidic. Not really very good. (0.5l bottle with KnutAlbert.)",9
"Thin white head does not last. Hazy yellow body. Mealy fruity light malty aroma. Sweetish mild pea and light malt taste with fruity notes. Slightly sweet. Dryish mild pea aftertaste. Unremarkable, but not bad. (0.5l bottle with KnutAlbert.)",12
"Medium white head. Hazy opaque yellow body. Dense stale wheaty yeasty aroma with vague citric notes in the background. Dryish wheaty vinegary citric taste. Thin, mealy mouthfeel. Probably too old. (0.355l bottle from gr0ve.)",10
"Biggish coarseish white head shrinks slowly. Copper body. Light aroma of grain and caramel with buttery notes and a faint hint of grassy hops. Dry, grassy buttery taste of rounded caramel malts. Faint fruity hints. Papery aftertaste with notes of metal. Slightly harsh mouthfeel. Clean palate. Not much taste, but not tasteless, either. Decent. (0.5l can from Centra.)",10
"Small white head. Brown body. Fruity malty strawberry aroma, very light and fresh. Dryish light delicate fruity floral citric strawberry taste with malty tea notes. Aftertaste is the same. Very nice! (0.5l bottle from KnutAlbert.)",13
"Thin white head. Slightly hazy pale yellow body with light carbonation. Fruity stale grainy taste with citric notes. Sharpish chalky mouthfeel. Dry stale watery aftertaste. Not the best beer. (0.75l bottle from Gamle Strand, København.)",11
"Small brown head does not last. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Thi  meaty smoky chocolatey aroma, very harmonic and balanced. Quite strong, too. Dry smoky roasty chocolatey taste. Thin, clean, sharpish mouthfeel. Dry chocolatey grainy aftertaste with notes of smoke. Very nice! Balanced, powerful, and subtle. (0.5l bottle from gr0ve.)",15
"Huge offwhite shiny head. Paleish yellow body with vigourous carbonation. Rich, hoppy, almost fruity, aroma. Notes of sulphur, probably from age. Sharpish dry-sweet resiny chalky rich hoppy taste, again with that almost-fruity background. Powerful! Citric, tropical fruit hop aftertaste. Clean. An excellent beer.

"Big offwhite head. Light amber body. Deep sweet peach aroma with a kind of artificial candy character. Deep sweet-and-dry peachy fruit taste. Quite chalky, sharpish mouthfeel. Aftertaste is the same, and somewhat metallic. A bit too artificial and one-dimensionally peachy for my tastes. (0.5l bottle from Sainsbury's.)",12
"Big shiny brown-beige lasting head. Lovely deep red barely translucent body. Powerful harmonic aroma of caramel pudding, syrup, vanilla, and chocolate. Initially mild sweetish chocolatey caramel pudding taste later grows quite powerful. Notes of vanilla, wood, and syrup with some roastiness. Mouthfeel is slightly watery. Good balance. Dry roasty caramel pudding aftertaste. Probably fermented further in the bottle, as it tried to escape out of the bottle on opening, which may have taken some of the sweetness reported by others. Very nice! The first chocolate beer I&#8217;ve actually liked. (0.5l bottle from SuperBrugsen, Ordrup. BBD 2007-12-08.)",15
"Smallish white head shrinks rapidly. Yellow body with carbonation. Grainy aroma with notes of apples and butter. Dry grain and cardboard taste. Clean mouthfeel, if a bit sharpish. Very dry papery grainy aftertaste. Somewhat chalky. A thoroughly average beer, and a bit too dry for what else it offers, in my opinion. (0.5l can from Centra.)",10

Dry sharpish licorice and fruit taste with spicy peppery notes. Considerable alcohol heat as well as carbonation in the mouth. Dry wooden spicy alcoholic licorice aftertaste. Some chocolate, too. Surprisingly light in body and taste. Very nice! (0.75l bottle, a Christmas gift from hcalsos.)",15
"Medium yellowish beige head. Reddish brown opaque body. Yeasty, fruity, roasty aroma with spice notes. Faintly acidic, wheaty yeasty roasty taste with burnt notes. Some spice as well, and chocolate. Dry metallic roasty wheat aftertaste. Has the signature HB taste. Slightly light body; probably would have been even better with more alcohol. Nice! (0.5l bottle, Christmas gift from Knut Albert.)",12
"Came leaping out of the bottle on opening. By the time things were cleaned up the head was just a thin white film. Amber body. Deep chocolatey caramelly aroma with fruity hoppy notes. Dry caramelly papery taste with fruity notes. Aftertaste is the same. Nice! (0.5l bottle from SuperBrugsen, Ordrup.)",12
"Largish white head shrinks rapidly. Hazy yellow body with light carbonation. Fruity mealy vegetable aroma with elderberry notes. Kind of odd. Dry fruity, yeasty taste with notes of elderberry and ash. Traces of banana and vanilla, plus some oranges. Aftertaste is about the same. Nice, and very unusual. &#40;0.5l bottle from SuperBrugsen, Ordrup. Rated three times. Girlfriend loves this one.&#41;",13
"Medium offwhite head of unevenly sized bubbles. Amber body. Fruity yeasty caramelly aroma with papery notes. Dry fruity caramelly taste with dry, chalky, papery finish. Some pepper, too. It's ok, but not very special. (0.5l bottle, SuperBrugsen, Ordrup.)",11
"Small white head shrinks rapidly. Deep red body. Sweetish vinuous fruity malty aroma with musty character. Sweetish earthy malty taste with toffeeish chocolatey notes. Dry background and aftertaste. Aftertaste is much the same, but with notes of tea, honey, and hops. Nice, highly drinkable beer, but there's no way this is a typical bitter. Could be persuaded to have another. (0.5l bottle from Centra.)",13
"I take the cap off, slowly. Whoosh&#033; Instant beer fountain. Literally 10 minutes later I have cleaned up the mess and am ready to sample. Big offwhite head. Hazy orange body with small suspended particles, possibly roused from the bottom by the carbonation. Fruity yeasty aroma with bready notes, kind of thin and with a metallic tinge. Dryish fruity metallic yeasty taste. Flat, dull mouthfeel. (Might have something to do with the gushing...) Thin-bodied. Dry watery metallic aftertaste. Wonderful&#033; The previous bottle was infected, while this one showered my living room and still tastes no better than an average pale lager. At 10 USD a bottle, I think I&rsquo;ve had as many of these as I&rsquo;m ever going to. (0.5l bottle, Centra.)",9
"Small offwhite creamy head. Deep red faintly hazy body. Firm malty caramelly aroma with fruity wild berry notes. Roasty dry sweetish malty taste with fruity chocolatey notes. Some acidity as well, helps to make it more refreshing. Dry faintly hoppy malty wild berry aftertaste. Taste is light for the amount of alcohol, but balanced and quite harmonic. Nice! (0.5l draft at the brewpub. Note: board and pump clip both say &quot;Juleøl&quot;, but it was &quot;Julebrygg&quot;.)",12
"Medium offwhite lasting head is frothy on top and settles slowly into a creamy head sharply delineated from the chestnut brown body. Resiny roasty malty aroma, very faint. Soft sweetish roasty caramel taste, slightly stale and musty. Soft, smooth, mild mouthfeel. Very faint and mild. Dryish aftertaste same as initial taste. A bit mild, stale, and boring.

"Thin coarse white head. Yellow body. Floral tropical fruit aroma with notes of peas. Sweetish floral tropical fruit hop taste, delicate and clear. Soft, clean mouthfeel. Dry peas and tropical fruit aftertaste. Very nice and hoppy! (0.5pt cask at the Wenlock Arms.)",13
"Medium offwhite coarse head. Hazy amber body. Light, delicate aroma of peas, tea, and wood. Dry soft taste of peas and wood with earthy caramel notes. Faint residual sweetness with some resin. Aftertaste is the same. Soft and mild mouthfeel, if a bit watery. Not bad, but overall too watery for my tastes. (0.5pt cask at the Duke of Cambridge, Islington, London, badged as Pitfield SB.)",11
"Very small coarse offwhite head. Slightly hazy amber body. Wooden floral aroma. Soft wooden tea taste with resiny hop notes. Soft, chalky mouthfeel. Dry wooden resiny aftertaste lingers. Mostly dry and wooden; pretty boring. (0.5pt cask at the Duke of Cambridge, Islington, London.)",12
"Small white lasting head. Yellow body. Light resiny earthy aroma with fruity notes. Light resiny hoppy earthy pea-like taste. Soft, chalky mouthfeel. Dry throughout. Aftertaste is the same. A bit watery. Ok, but a bit boring. (0.5pt cask at the Island Queen.)",12

"Big offwhite lasting head. Orange body with carbonation. Vague straw and metal aroma with perfumy notes. Dry watery perfumy caramel and malts taste; quite artificial. Mild and mellow, but mouthfeel  is sharpish. No aftertaste. Boring, not very good. (0.5l can from Sainsbury's.)",8
"Small white head. Light brownish body with carbonation. Light grain and caramel aroma with roasty notes. Dry grain and straw taste with caramel notes. Aftertaste is the same. Sharpish, fizzy mouthfeel. A bit watery. Decent, but unexciting. (0.33l bottle at the Lord Clyde.)",11

Imagine walking around the Sahara for two weeks in the same woolen socks and same rubber boots; at the end of it they would smell like this. Dry chemical intensely rubbery taste, densely chalky, with powerful cardboard notes. As if they dissolved the cardboard box the rubber boots came in, and used that as well.

"Biggish white head. Pale yellow body. Light grainy malty aroma. Dryish mealy taste of Christmas spice with fruity notes. Surprisingly sharp. Dry, mealy sharp spicy aftertaste. Nice, but the spices are too sharp and unbalanced, on the whole not worth a detour. (0.275l on draft in Montreal, St.Catherine)",13
"Big shiny offwhite head. Yellow body with lots of carbonation. Thin malty aroma. Malty perfumed taste, somewhat vague. Smooth, clean mouthfeel. Traces of corn and hops. No real aftertaste, just a little metal. It's OK, a bit of flavour, and no real offtastes. (0.355l can, courtesy of Air Canada.)",11
"Huge offwhite shiny head settles slowly. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Faint fruity grassy aroma. Sweet fruity papery taste, quite dry. Smooth empty mouthfeel. Perfumy notes.

"Big white head shrinks slowly. Biggish amber body with small yeast floaties. Alcoholic fruity licorice aroma with sour milk notes. Spicy fruity licorice taste with wooden, bready alcoholic notes.

"Big brown head. Deep dark red translucent body. Neutral smoky licorice aroma. Sweet earthy watery licorice taste with no bitterness. Licorice aftertaste. Too simple and flat. No resistance, no depth. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel, Antwerp.)",11
"Biggish offwhite head. Amber reddish body. Sweet syrupy fruity aroma with spicy toffee and wood notes. Some alcohol can be deteced. Sweet sugary sharpish alcoholic toffee and candy taste. A touch watery. Peppery, notes of wood. Aftertaste is slightly stale and tobaccoish. Leaves the lips sticky. Good, but not great. A bit too sweet. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel, Antwerp.)",13
"Medium coarse white head collapses quickly into a thin white ring. Copper body. Faint, vague unclean vegetable and corn aroma. Sharp chalky watery taste, very dry, of grain and metal. Faint roastiness. No real aftertaste. One-dimensional, harsh, and unpleasant. (0.5l can, thanks to hcalsos.)",5
"Big white head. Yellow body. Rubbery, mealy aroma, very light. Light mealy rubbery taste. Soft mouthfeel. Some grain and dust. Boring! (0.5l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)",10

"Big coarse white head. Hazy yellow body with carbonation. Mealy empty alcoholic aroma. Intense sharp dry fruity alcoholic taste. Notes of hops, too. Aftertaste is dry and spicy. Noticeable alcohol heat. Not that successful. Too one-dimensional with all the alcohol and bitterness. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel.)",12
"Small white head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light fruity aroma. Spicy acidic thin taste with mealy dry metallic notes. Thin, sharpish aftertaste. Boring, not too god. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel.)",12

"Small pinkish white head. Hazy pale crimson body. Metallic grainy sour aroma with papery notes. Metallic bitter lambik taste with intense barnyard character. Sharp, mouth-puckeringly sour. Faint sweetness towards the end. An experience, but not necessarily a pleasant one. (0.75l bottle, thanks to gr0ve.)",10
"Small offwhite head. Hazy chestnut brown body. Sugary medicinal licorice aroma with toffeeish notes. Sharpish spicy licorice taste with roasty spicy hoppy notes. Dryish grassy aftertaste. It's OK. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel, Antwerp.)",12
"Big white head. Yellow body. Mealy, rubbery aroma. Sweetish spicy milky yeasty aroma with wheaty and toffeeish notes. Rounded, sharpish mouthfeel. Dry, grassy mealy milky aftertaste. Nice, but a bit dull. (0.33l bottle from Dorstvlegel, Antwerp.)",12

Sour, bitter metallic grainy lambik taste with strong grassy metal hop notes. Bitter, sharp metal aftertaste with intense lingering grassy hop taste.

"Small white head disappears quickly. Golden body. Grassy, fruity, malty aroma with notes of corn. Kind of dense. Dry, grainy malt and corn taste. Surprisingly much taste, slightly toffeeish. Reminiscent of Scandinavian &quot;gold&quot; beers. Nice, decent. (0.33l bottle, thanks to KnutAlbert.)",11
"Big white coarse head shrinks quickly. Hazy orange body with strong carbonation. Deep, sweetish, ripe fruit aroma with hoppy notes, faintly metallic, with touches of wild berries. Thin, and faintly harsh, because of the carbonation. Acidic citric taste of wild berries and metal with notes of honey; faintly milky. Bitter, papery aftertaste, but kind of sweetish, too. The two don&#8217;t mix well. Not as bad as it sounds, but not a typical Belgian, and not too pleasant. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Huge white lasting head. Hazy amber body with lots of carbonation. Sweet fruity spicy aroma with strong bready notes. Strong fruity spicy peppery taste with, again, strong bready, yeasty notes. Spicy, softly metallic, peppery aftertaste. Excellent! A great beer! (0.33l bottle. Unfortunately stored for too long, apparently. I need to rerate.)",17

"Bottle starts fizzing and sputtering foam as soon as the cap is tilted a bit. I spend 10 minutes opening it. Clearly, it has not benefited from being stored for 7 months. Big coarse white head quickly shrinks into nothing. Yellow body. Dry, hoppy floral aroma with fruity notes. Bitter, slightly acidic, floral malty taste with fruity, resiny notes. There is an underlying sweetness, too. Bitter, chalky floral aftertaste. Quite nice. (0.5l bottle from Real Ale Ltd.)",13
"Big white head. Yellow body. Soft, resiny pine needle aroma. Simple, but nice. Sweetish hoppy resiny pine needle taste with notes of chocolate(?!), malts, and hay. Soft, silky mouthfeel. Dry, resiny hay aftertaste. Nice, understated IPA. Good session beer, or would be, if it wasn't too strong. (0.5l bottle from Real Ale Ltd.)",14
"Huge light brown coarse head. Opaque black body. Sweetish, smoky, burnt licorice aroma, somewhat thin. Sweetish smoky burnt licorice aroma with chocolate notes. Dry, burnt softly metallic sooty aftertaste. A decent stout, but like many English stouts it's too watery and burnt. (0.5l bottle from Alko.)",13
"Big beige head. Deep dark red body. Soft, sweetish licorice aroma, very faint. Very sweet, rounded, milky toffee taste with notes of pepper, tobacco, and licorice. Some alcohol heat is noticeable. Bitter tobacco aftertaste. It's OK, but should have had much more flavour than this. A bit disappointing. (0.33l bottle from Alko.)",12
"Huge white head. Slightly hazy orange body. Sweetish wooden hoppy aroma with notes of citrus and resin. Aroma is quite light and mild. Dry tobaccoish smoky citric hoppy taste with floral notes. No aftertaste, but a bitter, metallic taste lingers. It's OK, but not too good. May be that it suffered in storage here at home. (0.5l bottle from Alko.)",12
"Big lasting offwhite head (in a Duvel glass!). Deep red body with carbonation. Deep roasty licorice aroma with earthy wild berry notes; harmonic. Deep, sweet earthy licorice taste with peppery, roasty notes. Dry fruity earthy licorice aftertaste. A very nice balanced lager. (0.5l bottle at Internasjonalen.)",15

"Big white head collapses in a matter of seconds, leaving just a thin white ring. Pale yellow body. Aroma of apple, alcohol, and fennel. Taste is intense alcoholic apple and fennel, very thin and harsh. No real aftertaste, just a kind of emptiness. Did not like this at all. Had a few sips to do the rating, then poured out the rest. Yuck! (0.75l bottle from the wine monopoly.)",4
"Small dark brown head doesn&#8217;t last, but shrinks into a thin ring. Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Intense sweet toffeeish chocolate liquor aroma with notes of coffee, bread, and ripe fruit. Very harmonic and balanced, despite the clear alcohol presence.Deep, intense sweet chocolate and toffee taste with licorice and alcohol notes. Bready, yeasty presence, too. Very harmonic. Mouthfeel is initially thick and oily, then goes intensely warm from the alcohol. Also a kind of muddy, coarse feel to it. No real aftertaste, but bitter orange-peel and chocolate taste lingers. The beer is still a bit sharp and edgy; I imagine it&#8217;s likely to mellow and improve a lot with age. It feels a bit too powerful in the first couple of sips, but then settles into a sweet chocolatey toffee character, which is intensely pleasurable. A pity I had to share this with my girlfriend; would have preferred to drink it all myself. :-) Fantastic! A king among beers, indeed. (0.5l bottle from the wine monopoly.)",18
"Smallish offwhite head. Slightly hazy brownish red body with some carbonation. Strong tropical fruity hop aroma with chocolatey, roasty malty background. Sharpish dry fruity hop taste with the same roasty malt background. Body is a bit thin and watery, perhaps unavoidable with only 4.5% alcohol, but leaves the hops a bit high and dry--that is, unbalanced. Dry, smoky burnt malt aftertaste. Very nice! One of the best beers you can buy in Norwegian shops (outside the wine monopoly). (0.5l bottle from Ica Gourmet, Aker Brygge, Oslo. Batch #99, oct '07. Previous rating, of an infected bottle from batch #67, came out at 2.0.)",12
"Big dark brown fine-laced head. Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Deep milky burnt chocolate aroma with dry coffee notes. Sweetish light burnt sooty dry coffee taste with oily pine needle and cocoa notes. Slightly thin mouthfeel. No real aftertaste. Quite nice, but more body would improve it. (0.5l bottle at Tegners.)",15
"Small white head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light straw and grass aroma with rubbery notes. Taste is dry grassy malts, very mild. Kind of oily, dense character, but not much. Dry, grassy aftertaste. Thoroughly average. (0.33l bottle at Arlanda.)",9
"Big dark brown fine-laced lasting head. Opaque black body goes dark red at edges. Burnt pine needle aroma. Deep sweetish burnt malt taste, kind of thin and sharp, with a very slight stickiness in the mouthfeel. Pine needle notes. No aftertaste. Complex sugar settles on the lips.

"Thin beige head does not last. Deep red body. Roasty resiny citric hop aroma. Deep, sweet fruity taste with roasty resiny notes. Dry fruity caramel aftertaste. Clean, sharpish mouthfeel. Very nice. (0.33l bottle at Oliver Twist.)",15

"Medium beige head. Deep dark barely translucent body. Deep, firm straw and malt aroma with notes of licorice. Sweet straw licorice and malt taste with a dry edge to it. Soft, smooth mouthfeel, and yet the dryness is kind of sharp. No real aftertaste. Good (0.355l bottle at Oliver Twist.)",16
Small light brown head fades quickly. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Sweetish sugary licorice aroma with no resistance. Deep dryish licorice and roasty caramel taste. Watery mouthfeel. No real aftertaste. Kind of boring and one-dimensional. (0.355l bottle at Oliver Twist.),12
"Smallish white head. Amber body. Deep, firm malty aroma with resiny, citric hop notes, as well as dry straw and grain. Beautifully clear. Deep, sweet, firm, dry malty straw taste with intense floral, resin, hay and pine needle notes. Clean, smooth mouthfeel, yet sharpish. Long, drawn-out dry hay and resin aftertaste. Absolutely gorgeous. (0.355l bottle at Oliver Twist.)",17
Small offwhite creamy head. Deep dark red body. Deep earthy caramelly aroma with fruity notes. Dry licorice and medicinal taste. Kind of flat mouthfeel. Aftertaste just kind of fades. Boring. (0.4l cask at Oliver Twist.),12

Deep sweet tobacco and earth licorice and wild berry taste with bitterish edge to it. Spicy, dry aftertaste. Very nice. (0.33l bottle at Tegners.)",15
"Thin offwhite head. Chestnut brown body with lazy carbonation. Faint sweetish caramelly aroma. Dry roasty caramelly taste with some edge and spicy notes, faintly fruity. More like a lager than an ale, if you ask me. Clear, sharp taste. Dry, dusty roasty caramel aftertaste. Nice. (0.5l bottle at Tegners.)",14
"Small offwhite head. Hazy dark red body. Sweet licorice earthy fruity aroma with caramel and pea notes. Deep sweet earthy caramel and licorice taste with spicy wild berry notes, slightly stale. Dry, peppery aftertaste. Some alcohol heat. Quite good. (0.33l bottle at Tegners.)",15

Dry sweetish smoky roasty caramel malt taste with rubbery, chalky notes. Dry, roasty hoppy aftertaste. Clean, edgy mouthfeel. Grew on me as I drank. Quite good. (0.5l bottle at Tegner.)",15
"Biggish offwhite head. Red-brown hazy body with fast carbonation. Light rubbery acidic smoky roasty caramel malt taste with spicy notes. A bit too thin-bodied, perhaps. No real aftertaste. Dusty, roasty taste lingers. Unusual, but not too good. (0.5l bottle at Tegners.)",12

"Big white head shrinks slowly. Hazy orange-amber body. Intense hoppy aroma of mango, pepper, and peas, with an oily quality. Bitter malty pine needle taste, a bit thin, with notes of yeast and spice. Bitter, grassy dandelion aftertaste. Quite good, but a bit more body would have balanced the hops better. (0.33l bottle at Tegners.)",14
"Small white head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light rubbery malty aroma with mealy notes. Dry apple and malts taste with rubbery notes. Harsh, chalky mouthfeel. Dry, malty aftertaste. Boring, not very good. (0.4l draft at Sallys in Stockholm.)",9

"Medum white head. Pale faintly hazy yellow body. Mealy spicy rubbery aroma. Sharp chalky rubbery taste with spicy, fruity hoppy typically Belgian notes. Has good aspects, but too watered down for them to have much effect. Intensely harsh mouthfeel does not help. No real aftertaste. Not very successful. (0.25l bottle at Akkurat.)",8
"Big offwhite head. Deep yellow body with carbonation. Light mealy malty aroma. Sweet spicy floral taste, very soft and mild. Smooth, clean mouthfeel. Sharpish, dry edge throughout as well (and, yes, it's also smooth). Dry, resiny hop aftertaste. An excellent lager. (0.5l bottle at Akkurat.)",14
"Smallish offwhite head. Light brown body with particles. Strong sweetish overripe floral earthy aroma, with strawberry notes. Medicinal watery strawberry taste, very dry. No real aftertaste. It's OK, but a bit watery and harsh. (0.33l bottle at Akkurat.)",10
"Big white lasting head. Yellow body. Dense rubbery aroma with milky chemical notes. Intense rubbery grainy taste with a disgusting watery mouthfeel, as though it&#8217;s been watered down too far. Awful. (0.33l bottle at Akkurat.)",4

"Big light brown head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Light milky licorice aroma with meaty notes. Smoky, burnt licorice and cocoa taste with metallic notes. Milky mouthfeel. The alcohol strength is not noticeable. Warm, peppery licorice and cocoa aftertaste. Unusual. Strange. Not bad. (0.5l bottle. Possibly too old, though BB date is 30 November 2007.)",11
"Huge dark brown coarse head shrinks slowly. Opaque black body. Faint spicy licorice aroma. Sweet licorice taste with no real resistance, more like a soft drink. No aftertaste. Sharpish mouthfeel. It's OK, but kind of boring. No reason to get very excited about this. (0.33l bottle. Bottled November 2005.)",10
"Huge white fine-laced head. Yellow body. Mealy diffuse malt aroma with notes of vegetables and apples. Sweetish caramelly taste with faint grassy notes, quite mild and very simple.

Soft, dusty mouthfeel, quite smooth. Some sweetness. Dry dusty peppery aftertaste with grassy notes. Quite good, and would be great without the rubber. (0.33l can, Alko, Helsinki. Second rating. First was bad.)",11
"Big white coarse head shrinks quickly, leaving no lace. Deep yellow body with light carbonation. Sweetish aroma of very ripe fruit and grain, with bready notes.

"Big coarse offwhite head shrinks quickly. Body is beautiful copper. Roasty, caramelly oily aroma with notes of nuts and alcohol. Deep, sweet, roasty caramel taste with alcoholic notes. Very clean taste and mouthfeel. Dryish roasty caramel aftertaste leaves kind of dry medicinal feeling. Quite good. (0.33l bottle. Got to love the Finnish sound system: tuplapukki = doublebock.)",13
"Big offwhite coarse head quickly shrinks into a thin coarse ring with a hissing sound. Yellow body. Dense, oily apple and malt aroma with alcoholic notes. Deep, alcoholic and chalky apple and malt taste with considerable alcohol heat. Surprisingly oily mouthfeel. Bitter malt aftertaste with notes of straw. Well.

"Biggish white head. Brownish red body. Light sweetish caramelly aroma with traces of alcohol. Sweetish flour and caramel taste, somewhat roasty, with watery, buttery notes. (How something can be both watery and buttery at the same time is a bit of mystery, but somehow this beer manages.) Dry caramelly aftertaste. Roasty taste lingers. Not that much taste.

"Biggish dark brown head. Opaque black body, barely translucent dark red at edge. Sweet delicate licorice and toffee aroma with notes of coffee and traces of pine needles.

Taste is deep burnt malts with coffee notes, soot, and a touch of watery toffee. Dry, sooty aftertaste. Slightly watery, probably because they made it at 4.7%. Not bad, but a bit thin and one-dimensional. Could be more exciting. (0.33l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve!)",14
"Biggish shiny white head. Yellow body with some carbonation and small particles. Sweetish earthy aroma of malts, apples, perfume, and some rubber. Sweetish earthy-bitter taste of light malts, yeast, and metallic rubber, with a touch of peas. Much better than the description makes it sound. Dry, floral aftertaste. A good helles. (0.33l can.)",14
"Small dark brown head with a rash of larger bubbles. Deep dark red body, only just transparent. Dense, earthy, complex coffee aroma. Dry, bitter coffee taste, somewhat thin-bodied. In fact, it tastes like a slightly watery espresso. The coffee taste is quite complex, but drowns out anything else that might be present. Aftertaste is the same. A very interesting beer, but perhaps a bit one-dimensional. I'd like it more if it were sweeter and offered more than just coffee. Still, getting this much taste into a 4.2% beer is quite impressive. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Small tan head. Hazy reddish brown body. Sweet, dense, firm aroma of tropical fruit and roasty malts with notes of perfume, spice, and chocolate. Very complex, yet harmonic aroma. Intense spicy taste of fruits, roasted malts, and alcohol. Very bitter. Slightly oily mouthfeel, and lots of alcohol warmth. Dry, burnt, spicy aftertaste. The alcohol and bitterness dominate a bit too much, unfortunately. (0.355l bottle.)",15
"Huge light beige head. Slightly hazy dark brown body. Light, complex aroma of dried fruit, licorice, and malts with a touch of chocolate. Taste is a deep and complex mix of dried plums, chocolate, licorice, and spice. Light-bodied and balanced despite the complexity. Dry, licorice and cocos aftertaste. A truly excellent beer! (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Small white head with some larger bubbles. Yellow body with some carbonation. Light rubbery aroma. Some people like sulphur in their pilsener; I don't. Taste is grainy rubber with notes of chalk and resin. Somewhat acidic. Vague, faint burnt caramel flavour as well. Dryish grainy aftertaste. Bitter chalky taste settles in the mouth. Sharp and not really very pleasant. (0.33l bottle.) ",7
"Small beige head. Deep dark red translucent body. Weak, earthy aroma of a mix of tropical fruit and tobacco. Taste is deep, sweetish burnt malts with fruit, earth, and tobacco notes. Some dense dark chocolate as well. Aftertaste is dry tobacco, and lingers. Slightly watery, but this isn't so strange, given the low alcohol content. It's not bad, but could be better. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Head is just a thin white ring. Hazy orange body. Sweetish lightly roasted aroma with notes of peas and hops. Taste is acidic roasty malts with a strong grassy hop profile. A bit thin and watery mouthfeel, partly because of the low carbonation. Aftertaste just kind of fades. A very good beer, even it's not very bock-like. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Small white head. Brown body with light carbonation. Sweet caramel and marzipan aroma with alcohol and earthy hop notes. Sweet roasted caramel and burnt almonds taste with alcohol and metallic buttery earth notes. Full-bodied. Oily mouthfeel. Very harmonic. Bittersweet metallic roasty grassy aftertaste. Quite subtle, but different, and interesting. Very good&#033; &#40;0.33l bottle. Rated twice.&#41;",15
"Small white shiny head. Yellow body with light carbonation. Sweet roasty caramel aroma with marzipan notes. Sweet earthy roasty caramel taste with notes of burnt almonds. Dry straw and grain aftertaste. A good bock, but not as good as the helles. Less of the signature Einbecker flavour. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Medium offwhite shiny head. Copper body. Sweetish grainy aroma with notes of corn. Taste is deep sweetish and bitter straw and grain with medicinal notes. Smooth mouthfeel. Grassy, bitter aftertaste. Quite good; better than expected. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Biggish coarseish offwhite head. Orange body with yeast floaties. Faintly spicy malt aroma. Taste is bitterish malts with notes of straw and wood with a touch of spice. Dry wooden aftertaste. Has a tart, medicinal quality to it. Very unusual taste, but would probably grow on me if I could find this again. Wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the recipe and brewing methods are quite old. Quite good. (0.375l bottle. Best before of april 2008.)",14
"Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of pear juice in it. Seems all Swedish ciders look exactly the same. Intensely artificial aroma of something that's probably meant to be pear. Sweet, sugary pear taste, completely free of complexity. Aftertaste is artificial pear bubble gum, settling down into a lingering watery unpleasant pear-like taste. Didn't like this one, either. (0.5l can.)",3
"Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of apple juice in it. Visually I'd be unable to tell this and the two Halmstad ciders apart. Sugary artificial apple and bubble gum aroma. No complexity at all. Disgusting thin, sugary artificial apple taste with notes of paper. Settles into a sweet bubblegum and metal aftertaste. This is awful. Man, sometimes you have to suffer for these ratings. (0.5l can.)",4
"Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of apple juice in it. In fact, it's visually identical with its apple cousin. Sweet, artificial powdery pear aroma. No complexity at all. Taste is thin, sweet pear, rather artificial. Somewhat watery. Aftertaste is artificially acidic, tastes of chemicals. Sugary. Drinkable, but unpleasant. (0.5l can.)",6
"Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of apple juice in it. Aroma is sweet apples, a bit artificial. Very straightforward. Taste is again sweet apples, somewhat artificial, and a bit watery. Aftertaste is sugary and artificial. Sugary taste lingers in the mouth. Drinkable, but way too sweet and artificial. (0.5l can.)",6
"Medium shiny offwhite head. Bronze body. Strange sweetish aroma of unidentifiable herbs, probably heather. Taste is light sweetish herbal with honey notes. Aftertaste is dry and metallic. Very interesting, and quite nice. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Medium tan head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Light earthy aroma with notes of chocolate. Thin acidic papery taste with brett notes. Probably spoiled, should probably rerate. (0.5l bottle.)",8
"Huge light tan head. Deep red body with small particles in it. Aroma is spicy wooden acidity. Taste is deep acidic salty metallic vomit-like.  This is seriously infected. Yuck, yuck, YUCK! Not just undrinkable, but unsippable, even. Needs to be rerated, if I dare. (0.5l bottle. Weird that KnutAlbert bought his bottle one the same day in the same shop and gave it 3.9. Talk about bad luck!)",1
"Medium beige head. Pretty deep dark red body. Papery, spicy licorice aroma with notes of grain. Dry, roasty taste with chocolate and paper notes and some grain. Aftertaste is dry grain. A bit watery. It's OK, but not very exciting. (0.33l bottle. Xmas 2006 variety.)",11
"Huge coarse white head, hazy with yeast floaties. Spicy banana aroma with soft metallic hops and licorice notes. Taste is banana and licorice with yeasty notes. Dry, softly metallic hop aftertaste. Some tobacco and pea notes linger. A good trippel, but not one of the best. (0.5l bottle.)",14
Biggish white head quickly shrinks and leaves lacing on the glass. Light brownish red body. Vague salty earthy aroma. Sweetish milky tobacco taste with a salty aftertaste. This one's been stored too long. I should rerate. (0.33l bottle.),8
"Throws a huge darkish brown head. Opaque black body goes deep dark red at edges. Mild milky, dry burnt aroma with faint earthy notes. Taste is sweetish milky chocolate with some burntness and light wooden notes. A bit watery, but mouthfeel is still somewhat oily. Dry, thin burnt aftertaste with some acidity. Decent, but very boring, and too watery. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Thin offwhite head. Hazy yellow body with vigourous carbonation. Hoppy metallic wooden barnyard aroma with tropical fruity notes. Dry-sour barnyard wooden grainy lemony taste with metallic peppery fruity notes. Thin, sharpish mouthfeel. Dry lemony wooden aftertaste with mineraly winter apple and wax notes. Faint barnyard throughout. Amazing harmony, even if the beer in some respects sharp and harsh.. &#40;0.355l bottle from Ole R. Original rating from an old bottle bought in Cambridge. Rated a third time from wine monopoly, then a fourth.&#41;",16
"Medium offwhite light brown head. Dark red body with tiny particles floating. Sweetish bready aroma, quite light, with notes of licorice and milk. Carbonates on the tongue. Light, faintly roasty taste with light fruitiness and a touch of spice. Dry, slightly roasty aftertaste. Thinnish. Well. This is OK, but pretty boring. Like a very watery and boring Belgian dubbel. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Small yellowish brown head quickly shrinks into thin ring. Deep dark red barely translucent body. Light sweetish earthy licorice aroma with roasty smoky notes. Thinnish burnt earthy smoky licorice taste with dryish burnt aftertaste. Strange, almost meaty notes in the background. Something faintly oily in the mouthfeel. Very unusual, and not bad, but not too great, either. May have been stored too long. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Big white head. Yellow body with some carbonation. Light apple-and-rubber aroma with mealy malt background. Light rubbery malt taste with mealy apple notes and some paper. Chalky notes. Dry, rubbery aftertaste. Typical eastern European lager, but not the best. (0.5l bottle.)",8
"No head to speak of. Opaque black body. Deep plum, sherry, and wild berries aroma. Taste is very similar. Complex and hard to describe, but in excellent condition. Amazing that it's held up so well for so many years. (0.33l bottle. 1983 vintage. Kulminator, Antwerp, of course.)",17
"Small white head quickly disappears. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Acidic earthy metallic aroma with wooden notes, not unlike a mild lambik. Dry, earthy metallic taste with notes of something rather like aged blue cheese. Somewhat watery. Dry, cheesy taste lingers. Interesting and drinkable, but not sure I like it. At least it's not like Norwegian industrial &quot;cider&quot;, which is just a soft drink with some apple in it. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Huge white creamy head over clear yellow body with carbonation. Deep aroma of tropical fruit and soft metal, as well as notes of wet paper and honey. Light papery tropical fruit taste, slightly acidic. Dry soft metal and water aftertaste with spice notes. Not bad, but some flaws, and a bit boring. (0.4l on tap at de Groote Witte Arend in Antwerp, where it was billed as &quot;de Arend Blond&quot;. It really is de Koninck Blond, though.)",13
"Huge offwhite shiny coarse head. Very faintly hazy yellow body with light carbonation. Chalky, earthy caramel aroma with notes of peas, straw, and rubber. Sweetish chalky straw and caramel taste with a soft mouthfeel. Notes of peas and earth. Dry earthy aftertaste with floral hop notes. Quite a lot of taste. A very good pilsener, and very unusual, although it definitely has the house profile. (0.33l bottle, Meny.)",13
"Biggish beige head. Black opaque body, as far as I can tell. Sweet banana aroma with notes of licorice, spice, and soft metallic hops. Deep, intensely spicy (paradise seeds, coriander, pepper, and cinnamon), licorice, and chocolate taste with strong banana notes. Aftertaste is chocolatey spice, quite bitter. Harmonic. A fantastic beer, one of the best Belgians. (0.33l bottle.)",17
"Medium beige head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Burnt chocolatey aroma with notes of soot and a hint of hops. Taste is clean, clear burntness with a pretty thin body, but this time not so much that it's a problem. Aftertaste is bitterish hops and burntness. Feels a bit acidic, but it's probably bitterness. A bit watery. They should allow themselves to go above 4.5%; that would have improved all of these beers. (0.5l draft.)",13
"Tiny white head. Hazy yellow body with carbonation. Sweetish fruity aroma with milky, yeasty notes, and peachy hops. Taste is dominated by peachy hops (in a weizen?!?) and very thin and watery otherwise. Dry throughout. Dry, peachy, chalky aftertaste. Salty. Thin hoppy taste lingers. I really like the hops, but this isn't even remotely like the German weizen it's advertised as. Mouthfeel is a real letdown. Could have made a nice APA session beer, though. (0.5l draft.)",10
"Medium shiny creamy white head. Orangeish yellow slightly hazy body with light carbonation. Light harmonic aroma that blends grassy hops, apples, and some rubber. Soft, spicy grass hop taste with a dryish edge. Aftertaste is chalky rubbery paper. Some chewiness. Could use more aroma hops and less rubber, but probably appeals to the locals. Lacks the signature metallic bitterness generally associated with Hansa. It's not too bad, but I didn't like the aftertaste too much. (0.5l draft.)",12
"Big offwhite shiny lasting head; greenish yellow body with strong carbonation. Light grainy aroma with notes of rubber. Taste is soft mild milky grain with a touch of chalk and grass. No aftertaste. It's unoffensive, but there's no reason to drink this other than to get drunk, and there are better ways of achieving that. (0.25l can on an SN Brussels flight.)",9
"Big offwhite shiny head. Deep red body. Acidic fruity licorice aroma. Deep roasty lightly acidic taste with notes of wood and cinnamon. Dry, spicy, lightly metallic aftertaste. Some dustiness in aftertaste mouthfeel. A sharp, bitter quality in the mouth grows stronger as you drink. Not bad, has character. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Big offwhite shiny head. Amber body. Sweet aroma of bread and fruit with notes of spice and licorice. Deep, sweet powerful taste of licorice and syrup. Spicy, dry aftertaste. Dried fruit. Carbonation on the tongue. Quite nice. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Big offwhite coarse lasting head. Hazy deep orange-brown body, clearly with lots of yeast. Light acidic wooden aroma, very faint. Taste is round, yeasty and fruity, very mild, with caramel and milk notes. Very smooth, with a milky mouthfeel. Dry all the way through. Dryish wooden aftertaste. Very unusual, but highly drinkable. (0.25l draft.)",14
"Medium white head. Opaque cloudy, pale yellow body. Light lemony yeasty aroma, with notes of flour. Acidic lemony wheat and yeast taste, quite light. Dryish aftertaste. Not much taste, but very drinkable. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Big creamy offwhite lasting head. Deep red-brown body with strong carbonation. Light sweetish licorice, bread, and spice aroma. Taste is watery sweetish cinnamon with light licorice notes. Slightly acidic dryish aftertaste of cane sugar. Not bad, but not very exciting, either. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Big offwhite creamy head. Yellow body with light carbonation. Light marzipan and soft metallic hop aroma. Deep, sweetish light malt taste, harmonic and refreshing with fruity notes. Dryish softly metallic hop aftertaste. Quite nice, but definitely a light session beer.",12
"Medium light brown head. Brown body with intense carbonation. Sweet honey aroma with notes of milk and caramel. Taste is bitter honey and wild berries, kind of dry. Milk, caramel, and spice, too. Dry wooden honey aftertaste. Some carbonation in the mouth. Very unusual, very smooth, very nice. Pity they stopped making it. (0.33l 1998 bottle at Kulminator.)",16
"Big shiny offwhite head. Deep yellow body with light carbonation. Light fruity aroma with soft hop notes. Taste is light, soft tropical fruit with notes of bread. Aftertaste is dry soft metal and fruit. Nice and very drinkable, but perhaps a bit sharp. (0.4l draft at Kulminator.)",14
"Big white head. Deep yellow body with carbonation. Light acidic fruit and wood aroma with tobacco and alcohol notes. Taste is clear acidic wooden and spicy with a touch of metal. Dry softly metallic and fruity aftertaste. Interesting, but a bit too sour without having enough else to offer. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Medium offwhite shiny head over light copper body. Sweetish sugary corn aroma with marzipan notes. Taste is strangely empty caramel with a buttery mouthfeel. Watery, unpleasantly artificial roasty aftertaste. Buttery taste lingers in the mouth. It didn't smell too bad, but the taste is unpleasant. It's a slick commercial product, with the unpleasant off taste that seems to go with that. (0.33l bottle.)",5
"Huge offwhite head; hazy dark red barely translucent body with carbonation. Sweet alcoholic licorice aroma with chocolate notes, slightly unbalanced. Deep sweet bitterish cinnamon and licorice taste, again somewhat off balance. Dry spicy fruity aftertaste. Alcohol heat, and some taste as well. Quite nice, but far from perfect. (0.33l bottle at 't Waagstuk, Antwerp. Bottle says it's brewed by Bios Ertvelde, but looks just like the one in the picture.)",14
"Small white head; red-brown body. Faint acidic fruity aroma. Lightly acidic fruity taste with light licorice notes. Dryish watery fruit aftertaste. Decent, but no more, for a supposed Belgian. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Biggish white head, pale yellow body with light carbonation. Light dusty malt aroma, very soft. Taste is chalky rubber with light acidity and watery sulphurous bitter aftertaste. Carbonates in the mouth. Some metal. Well. This isn't much of a beer. (0.4l draft.)",8
"Huge beige creamy head very slowly subsides into weird ice cream shapes. Hazily opaque brown body with carbonation. Sweet firm malt aroma with harmonic licorice and hop notes. Taste is again sweet and acidic malts with notes of licorice, pepper, cane sugar, and hops. Some chocolate, paradise seeds, cinnamon, and wood as well. A bit watery. Extremely complex, and a bit rough, but still very nice. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Small offwhite shiny head. Deep yellow-orange body with strong carbonation. Deep harmonic aroma of tropical fruit and honey with bready floral notes. Deep sweetish spicy taste of honey and flowers with a bitterish background throughout. Carbonation in the mouth. Dry softly metallic honey aftertaste. Nice, but the taste is a harsh, somehow. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Medium beige head. Deep dark body. Light acidic spicy aroma with touches of licorice. Deep acidic raspberry taste, somewhat watery. Dry, raspberry aftertaste with metallic notes lingering. ot bad, and quite drinkable, but nothing too special. Definitely not a winter warmer by Belgian standards. (0.33l draft.)",13
"Biggish creamy offwhite head eaten from below into huge bubbles. Deep yellow body with carbonation. Light metallic aroma. Taste is light grain and paper with a bitter metallic watery aftertaste. It's half-decent, but not very good. Missable. (0.25l bottle.)",8
"Medium big-bubbled beige head.  Deep red body with carbonation. Earthy linoleum and caramel aroma with spicy musty notes. Unusual.  Sweet-dryish buttery caramel and licorice taste with cocos and spice notes.  Fullish body.  Mild, soft mouthfeel with slight slickness.  Dryish spicy cinnamon and earth aftertaste with butterscotch and licorice notes.  Recognizably St Bernardus. Really nice. &#40;0.33l bottle, Bier Tempel, Brussels. Rated in 2007, rerate in 2011.&#41;",14
"Small white head shrinks quickly. Hazy light orange body. Sweet tropical fruit aroma with coriander and other spice notes. Taste is deep light and fruity, spicy with coriander and cinnamon. Dry, dusty aftertaste of spices. Very nice, and dangerously drinkable for an 8.5% beer. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Medium offwhite creamy head. Deep red body with some carbonation. Light acidic spicy malty aroma, somewhat fruity. Deep, sweetish raspberry taste with fruity notes. Aftertaste is bitterish, slightly metallic raspberry. Very nice, refreshing, and drinkable, even if not too complex. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Medium light beige head; dark brown body with carbonation. Sweet aroma of licorice and burnt malts with sugary notes. Very harmonic. Fruity. Deep sweet harmonic taste of burnt licorice and syrup with light grain and fruit notes and a touch of spice. Light a light, sweet spicy stout. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Bitter spicy wood aftertaste. Some alcohol heat. Very nice, if not typically Belgian; more like a Belgian/Scottish mix. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Small white head. Hazy yellow body with light carbonation. Sweet citrusy aroma with notes of yeast and flour, and something artificial. Taste is a citrusy fruity mix, rather artificial. Bitterish, metallic fruit aftertaste. This has more in common with soft drinks than with beer, but isn't unpleasant. (0.33l can.)",9
"Small offwhite head. Deep red body with carbonation. Resiny hop aroma. Taste is burnt malts and resiny hops so harmonically blended they can hardly be told apart. Light chocolatey ash notes, and faint touches of paper. Aftertaste is dusty, burnt malts with traces of metal. Quite nice, and much better than the steamer. (0.5l draft at OMB.)",13
"Small white head, deep reddish brown body with carbonation. Very light aroma, but some roasty malts can be made out. Deep dry burnt malt taste with some acidity (deliberate? I suspect not) and traces of metal and paper. Some traces of resiny hops, too. Lots of carbonation in the mouth. Dry, dusty roasty aftertaste. Dustiness detracts. Not bad, but has clear flaws. Still drinkable, though. (0.5l draft.)",11
"Small offwhite head. Hazy brown body with light carbonation. Sweetish clean slightly hopped aroma with caramel notes. Surprisingly mild aroma. Taste is initially light, dry, honeyish malts. Followed by a bitter, complex taste of lightly roasted malts, and citrusy floral hopes with fruity caramelly notes. Smoky, dusty taste lingers. Some alcohol heat. Very difficult to analyze because it is so harmonic. Good, and rather subtle. (0.5l draft.)",15
"Coarse mid-sized offwhite shiny head. Brownish body with light carbonation. Very clean citrusy hop aroma. Lovely! Taste is clean, smooth honey-like malts and citrusy hops. Dryish hops throughout. Great balance of malts and hops, and very harmonic. Bitterness settles in the mouth as you drink. Interesting, subtle, and very drinkable. (0.5l draft.)",16
"Small white head. Light brown body with some carbonation. Light, delicate sweetish malt aroma of burnt almonds, honey, and flowers. Light, dryish, bitterish honey-like malt taste, very harmonic. Dry pine needle aftertaste. Taste and aroma are both complex and subtle. Slightly watery, which makes it refreshing and easy to drink. Great session beer. Pity I have to go to Moss to drink this. (0.5l draft.)",15
"Medium light brown head. Almost opaque black body. Dense, milky burnt chocolate aroma. Intense, burning burnt taste of chocolate, hickory, and licorice. Strong, lasting alcohol heat. A great beer. (0.33l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve.)",17
"Small offwhite creamy head. Darkish reddish brown body with some carbonation. Lightly acidic caramelly aroma with slight wooden notes. Bitterish nutty caramel taste with light oaken watery aftertaste, kind of dry. Easily drinkable, but a bit boring. (0.5l can. Thanks to KnutAlbert.)",13
"Medium white head, yellow body. Acidic metallic aroma with wooden notes. Sour, delicate wooden taste with grain and metal notes. Watery aftertaste. Balanced and harmonic, although still quite challenging. Gueuze isn't really my thing. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Medium creamy offwhite head. Deep dark brownish red body with some carbonation. Burnt, malty harmonic aroma with cinnamon notes. Deep, balanced burnt wooden taste with vanilla, smoke, and caramel notes. Very well made. Extremely drinkable, considering how unusual it is. Very good. (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Big white head; hazy yellow body with carbonation. Citrusy, mealy, yeasty aroma with soft, metallic hop notes. Deep, spicy, wheaty yeast taste, dryish, with citrusy notes. Good, and very drinkable. (0.75l bottle. Thanks to yngwie.)",14
"Small light beige head. Deep brownish red body with yeast floaties. Deep, intense sweet firm malty, sugary aroma with strong notes of straw and caramel. Intense deep sweet malty caramel and straw taste with oily, dry, hoppy aftertaste. Fantastic! (0.75l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve.)",17
"Small white head. Deep yellow body with carbonation. Deep rubbery aroma. Sweet caramelly taste with apple notes and faint hops. It's decent, but not great. (0.5l can.)",10
"Medium white head; brown body with carbonation. Light caramelly hop aroma, very harmonic. Sweetish nutty caramel taste with dry, caramelly aftertaste. Very harmonic and balanced. Extremely drinkable. Dry, light citrusy edge. (0.5l bottle. Thanks to KnutAlbert for this one!)",15
"Coarse huge white head. Deep yellow slightly hazy body with intense carbonation. Sharp, sweet tropical fruity aroma with soft hoppy notes. Taste is deep, bitterish tropical fruit and yeasty, bready notes. Lightish. Tobacco and hop aftertaste. Nice, but not too great. (0.75l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve.)",14
"Huge coarseish white shiny head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light, rubbery, spicy aroma with soft spicy hops. Dry, marzipany soft hop aftertaste. Very nice and drinkable. (0.75l bottle.)",15

"Medium offwhite head.  Clear amber body with carbonation.  Fruity spicy herbal aroma with coriander and cardamom notes.  Dry-sweet herbal blueberry and cardamom taste with papery notes. Mid-bodied.  Fizzy mouthfeel.  Dry-bitter blueberry and cardamom aftertaste is a bit harsh, with herbal mealy papery coriander notes.  It's not really very harmonic, and a bit too harshly bitter.  Ah well.  &#40;0.5l bottle, gift from family. This rating replaces an old 3.7 rating from 2007.&#41;",12
"Big offwhite coarse head; reddish brown body with some carbonation. Light, sweetish, spicy fruity banana and caramel aroma. Sweet, light, fruity banana taste with watery caramel aftertaste. Spicy and dryish. Very nice! (0.75l bottle. Thanks to yngwie.)",16
"Medium creamy white head over hazy yellow body with carbonation. Mild faintly smoky aroma with notes of mealy, dusty banana. Milky banana taste with dryish mealy aftertaste. Normal, nice, drinkable, refreshing weizen. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Medium light brown head. Barely translucent dark brown, seemingly black, body with carbonation. Sweet, oily sugary aroma of licorice; powerful, yet harmonic and balanced. Light, burnt wooden caramel taste, somewhat dry and acidic. A bit watery, like so many English microbrews. Grainy caramel aftertaste. Interesting, but not great. (0.75l bottle. Thanks to KnutAlbert.)",13
"Medium offwhite head, creamy below and coarse on top. Deep brown body; hazy with floaties. Acidic wooden spicy aroma with soft metal notes. Soft wooden spicy watery taste. Strange watery aftertaste with wooden notes. A really bizarre beer, but not my favourite. (0.75l bottle. Thanks to KnutAlbert.)",11
"Medium white head quickly develops huge holes at the surface of the beer and then nearly disappears. Deep yellow body with strong carbonation. Rubbery papery aroma with a touch of apples. Strong carbonation on the tongue. Chalky, watery taste with some light malts. Dusty, dry dandelion aftertaste. Acceptable, but nothing special. (0.33l can. Thanks to KnutAlbert for this.)",8
"Huge offwhite head. Cloudy brown body with carbonation. Milky, rubbery, papery aroma. Thin, burnt, slightly acidic papery taste. Slightly watery. Burnt, watery aftertaste. Might be good with rakfisk; without it's a bit boring. Slight traces of infection, too. (0.33l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve.)",11
"Small light beige head. Slightly hazy dark reddish brown body with carbonation. Sweetish roasty aroma with slight papery notes. Taste is delicate, balanced roasty sweetish malts. Dryish slightly papery burnt malt aftertaste. Quid good, and very drinkable, but perhaps a bit boring. (0.33l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve!)",14
"Medium white head; copper body with some carbonation. Faintly sweetish apple aroma with faint traces of malts and hops. A bit too faint for a 6, but not bad. Mild malty taste with some apple and a bitterish edge. Chalky, bitterish aftertaste, slightly metallic. Think I can make out some aroma hop, but not sure. This is OK, but a weird choice for a celebratory beer. (0.5l can.)",10
"Big offwhite head; chestnut brown body. Milky rubbery aroma with a touch of roastiness and wet cardboard. Taste is bitterish milky rubber with a bitter, metallic aftertaste. Seems to be pretty generously hopped, but with bitter hops only, in the usual Ringnes style. The burnt malts mentioned on the can must be for colour only. This isn't the worst Munkholm, but it has little other than an absence of the worst off flavours to recommend it. (0.5l can.)",8
"Thin white coarse head. Deep dark brown body. Sharpish licorice, nuts, and metal aroma with sweetish wooden plum notes. Deep sweet wooden licorice taste with dry nutty aftertaste. Traces of smoke. Quite good, but not a sensation. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Thin white head. Hazy orange-brown body. Deep yeasty caramel aroma with spicy, milky notes, and some slight tobacco. Deep, milky pure caramel, toffee, and yeast taste. Dryish tobacco and toffee aftertaste. Not bad, but clearly too old, despite the best before date of 2009. (0.5l bottle. Brewed March 2004.)",14
"Creamy medium white head. Chestnut brown body with strong carbonation. Powerful wooden aroma with light cloves, cinnamon, and acidic touches. Reminiscent of a lambik, but without the metallic severity. Deep, sweetish wooden acidic cloves and cinnamon taste with metallic, nutty, fruity notes. Dry wooden, spicy aftertaste. Very powerful spiciness to this one; really enjoyed that. (0.5l bottle.)",17
"Thin white coarse head. Chestnut brown body. Sweet roasty caramel aroma with notes of metal and nuts. Deep caramelly nutty taste with metallic notes. Very reminiscent of Ruddles County, but more powerful in taste, and less bitter. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Thin white head. Red body with carbonation. Dense sweetish malt and cinnamon aroma with notes of roastiness, and perhaps a touch of smoke. Nice dry roasty caramel aftertaste. Good, but could have been denser and had more taste. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Thin white film passes for a head. Hazy yellow body with carbonation. Yeasty pea-like aroma with citric earth notes. Taste is deep, powerful light malts dominated by earthy pea-like hops with citric spicy notes. Excellent balance. Dry earthy aftertaste with an almost powdery texture. Very unusual, but a really nice beer, whatever style it's meant to be. (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Small beige creamy head with larger bubbles. Deep dark red, barely translucent. Milky chocolately aroma with oily earthy notes. Thin acidic burnt wooden taste. Thin, dry wooden chocolate aftertaste. This needs more body, but is very drinkable. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Biggish coarse white head that's creamy on top with larger bubbles. Slightly hazy orange body with carbonation. Light acidic perfumy aroma with notes of yeast and tea. Taste is deep, bitter and lightly malty and yeasty. Bitter metallic tea aftertaste. Body is a bit thin with a dusty mouthfeel. Spicy, wooden notes. A nice bitter, but nothing too remarkable. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Smallish white head, lightish brown body. Sweetish sugary aroma with earthy licorice notes. Bitter cinnamon licorice taste with citric notes. Bitter chalky aftertaste. Traces of butter. Dry, metallic aftertaste. This is slightly different, but nothing too special. More hops than you'd expect, but unfortunately only bitter hops, as is standard with Ringnes. Not very Bavarian. (0.5l can.)",10
"White head with larger bubbles. Copper body. Light sweetish butter naroma. Light, slightly sweet faint malty corn taste with a bitter metallic edge. Buttery notes, some grass. It's drinkable, but they didn't exactly splurge on the ingredients. Hard to see why they bothered make this. It does nothing that their existing beers don't already do. (0.5l can.)",8
"Biggish white head. Paleish yellow body. Thin corn aroma with cardboard notes. Thin, acidic cardboard and metal taste with dry background. Ends in bitter dandelion taste. Did they even use malts in this? This is just absolutely vile. Drainpour. (0.5l can.)",3
"Medium white head doesn't last. Paleish yellow body with some carbonation. Lightly caramelly malt aroma with notes of paper and corn. Bitterish papery taste with notes of water and corn. Kinda empty taste. Thin! Empty, slightly chalky aftertaste, almost a bit salty. Some cardboard, too. Why did they bother to make this? Surely even people who don't care about the taste can tell that this is crap? I doubt this will last. (0.5l can. Wish it were less.)",6
"Medium white head. Chestnut brown body. Thinnish caramelly aroma with light sweetish roasty notes, kind of fruity and peppery. Light sweet-yet-bitter caramelly wooden taste. Perfect dryish/fruity balance with lovely wooden edge. Clean palate, mid body. Dry wooden aftertaste with peppery hop notes. An excellent bitter, impressively well made. (0.5l bottle. Rated twice.)",15
"Hardly any head, just a very thin white film. Dark red translucent body. Sweet licorice aroma with earthy notes. Bitter hoppy licorice taste with burnt notes. Sweet maltiness detectable in background. Dry, burnt aftertaste lingers. Could have had a bit more edge, but still very good. (0.66l bottle.)",16
"Biggish creamy white head. Hazy orange body. Milky, faintly acidic wheat aroma with citric notes. Taste is wheaty caramel and citrus with a dry, spicy aftertaste. Clean, fresh. Really nice. One of the best globally distributed beers. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Medium white creamy head. Light orange body with strong carbonation. Firm, sweet, malty aroma with notes of fruit, corn, and a touch of hops. Sharpish, hoppy malty taste with earthy, fruity notes. Dry, metallic fruity aftertaste. Notes of tobacco, which may mean that the beer is a bit too old. Nice, but nothing too special. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Small white head. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Sweet tropical fruit aroma with slightly metallic hop notes. Not that much aroma. Bitterish fruity taste with metallic hop tinge. Soft, smooth mouthfeel. Dry, bitter metallic aftertaste with flat, almost papery background and peppery notes. Lots of taste, yet still quite light; soft, yet harsh; this is a strange beer. Quite nice. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Medium white head. Faintly hazy yellow body. Clean, clear tropical fruit aroma. Sweetish light fruity malty aroma with strong spicy notes and clear soft metal hops. Some wood as well. Dry papery fruity aftertaste. Good, but not that much taste. (0.33l bottle from BeerMania. Second rating; first bottle I got was off.)",13
"Big dark beige creamy head. Dark red translucent body. Sweetish caramelly aroma with notes of smoke and dry milkiness. Taste is sharp because of carbonation, but eventually settles down into papery burntness and milky caramel. Sweetish. A dry burnt paper taste lingers. Not at all bad. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Big brown coarse head shrinks quickly. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Strange earthy, meaty, peppery, liquorice aroma, faintly acidic with notes of metal. Taste is sharp, almost biting because of carbonation in mouth. Sooty, metallic, and roasty with what seems like hop notes. Burnt, meaty aftertaste. An unusual beer, but quite nice. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"No head. Hazy orange body. Sweet aroma of apples and honey. Sweet, sharpish taste of apples and honey with watery notes. Sharp, caramelly aftertaste with strong honey notes. Thinnish body. Nice. Leaves a sticky feeling on the lips afterwards. (0.33l plastic bottle.)",14
"Big white head with a rash of large bubbles in the middle. Light coppery body. Fresh, sweetish light malt aroma with faint apple and rubber notes. Taste is bitter, caramelly malts with a rubbery apple aftertaste. Dry metallic taste with notes of hops lingers. Nice, but nothing too special. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Largish light brown head. Dark red body, barely translucent. Sweet, earthy caramel aroma. Sweet, soft grainy straw taste with caramel notes. Lacking in balance: no hops or bite of any kind, just slack sweetness. Kind of like Norwegian wort beer. It's OK, but too spineless to be very interesting. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium beige head. Dark red translucent body with carbonation. Strange, rubbery, earhty aroma, slightly dry. Sweet, watery taste of wild berries, metal, and earth with a dry slightly empty aftertaste. Quite good, but nothing too special. Nothing like normal porter, or even schwarzbier.",13
"Big coarse beige head. Dark red barely translucent body. Dry, thin, burnt, vaguely malty aroma with faint fruit notes and touches of rubber. Taste is initially sooty, giving way to burnt chocolate with faint fruit notes. Dry all the way; aftertaste just kind of fades out. It's a very typical German schwarzbier, but I find them to be too dry and boring to get very excited over. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Big offwhite creamy head shrinks slowly. Body is light red with some carbonation. Deep firm licorice malt aroma with notes of earth, milk, and caramel. Soft and harmonic. Taste is powerfully sweet malts with spicy, peppery cinnamon notes and an earthy licorice backdrop. Hops noticeable throughout, as well as a kind of acidic edge. Ends in a dry, earthy aftertaste. Nice and very drinkable. (0.355l bottle.)",14
"Huge creamy white head. Clear yellow body with carbonation. Light, faintly acidic soft metal aroma. Faintly dry, soft, papery, grainy aftertaste. Delicate, refreshing, well balanced. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Small white head. Yellow body with single column of carbonation. Sweet caramelly aroma with fruity, floral notes. Taste is deepish caramel with dry, grassy undertow, and eventually aftertaste. Some metal in aftertaste. For a pilsener this is excellent. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Small creamy beige head. Dark red translucent body. Mild caramelly aroma with milky and wild berry notes. Extremely soft and smooth mouthfeel. Taste is deep licorice and caramel with wild berry notes. Faintly dry, milky caramel aftertaste. Very nice. Could drink any amount of this. (0.5l bottle.)<br>Earlier Rating: 9/6/2005 Total Score: 4.4<br>Small nice-looking dark-beige creamy head. Nearly opaque red-black body. Lovely deep sweet malty, earthy aroma. Huge, sweet taste with lots of chocolate and licorice; complex, yet harmonic. Fades into a simple, rounded finish. A beautiful beer; drinkable, yet too sweet and powerful to be drunk in any great quantity. Grows more dense as you drink it. (This rating sucks. I have to rerate this one.)",15
"Medium light brown head. Opaque black body. Dry burnt chocolate aroma with notes of wild berries and metal. Very harmonic. Taste is deep, sweet chocolate and licorice, very well balanced with wild berry notes. Smooth, dryish mouthfeel. Dry, roasty coffee and chocolate aftertaste. An excellent porter! (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Thin coarse white head; slightly hazy light orange body. Fruity, faintly wooden aroma with notes of light malts. Taste is soft wooden fruit again with notes of wild berries. Aftertaste is bitter resin and grass. Quite hoppy and excellent light, delicate mouthfeel. Really very nice. An excellent session beer. (0.5 pint on cask.)",14
"Bottle erupts in a fountain of foam once the cork is off. Small white head; reddish brown body. Sweet licorice and banana aroma with strong, sharpish spice notes. Touches of bubble gum. Spicy tobacco-like licorice taste with chocolate notes. Dry, yeasty aftertaste. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Big brown head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Thin, sooty chocolate aroma with burnt notes and touches of pine and vanilla. Taste is thin, burnt chocolate with dry pine aftertaste. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Untwisted the wire cage, and soon after the cork flew out, taking the cage with it. Huge offwhite head. Hazy brown body with yeast particles just visible. Slightly acidic tobacco aroma with milky, bready spice notes. Taste is bitterish licorice with strong Christmas spices and yeast. Bitterish metallic lambic-like finish. Strange, but nice. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Offwhite huge fine-laced head. Dark red translucent body, with an opaque yeast column to one side. Dark licorice aroma with peppery notes and milky tobacco off taste. Spice notes as well. Taste is sweetish chocolate and tobacco. Light peppery and milky notes. Faintly dry aftertaste. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Almost no head, just a white ring. Slightly hazy orange body. Bitter citric hoppy aroma with notes of peach and dry alcohol. Bitter, oily grapefruit taste with chalky notes. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Creamy medium offwhite head. Light chestnut brown body. Light delicate citric, woody herbal aroma. Wonderfully subtle and balanced. Light, old hops. Faintly peppery and metallic. Acidic salty taste, quite hot and spicy. Peppery. Thin-bodied. Light, delicate background. A really weird beer, and not too successful, in my opinion. (0.75l bottle.)",10
"Small white head. Orange body. Acidic, lambic-like barnyard aroma. Acidic, spicy, fruity bitter chalky tobacco taste. Clear traces of brett. :-/ This is infected, just as the Natte I had last night. Yeasty taste. Probably a lot better when not infected. Should re-rate. (0.33l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)",11
"Largish offwhite head. Hazy opaque light brown body with carbonation. Light wooden bananaish aroma with vague rubbery notes. Deep wooden, bananaish, roasty malty taste with spicy notes. Peppery. Dry, spicy aftertaste. Very nice. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Small white head. Lightish brown body. Sweetish, grainy caramel and malt aroma with notes of hay. Sweetish grainy hay-like taste, quite light. Watery body. A bit lacking in taste, but a decent session beer. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Small offwhite head quickly disappears. Hazy chestnut brown body. Acidic alcohol and caramel aroma with notes of raspberry. Taste is milky acidic wild berries with notes of water and something reminiscent of stomach acid. Very unusual, very interesting, and definitely drinkable. Not a typical sahti, even if it has some of the special sahti characteristics. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Medium creamy light brown head. Dark red barely translucent body. Firm sweetish earthy aroma of licorice and caramel with milky notes. Taste is spicy, oily roasty licorice with peppery notes. Clean. Dry, peppery, milky aftertaste lingers. Nice! (0.355l bottle.)",15
"Creamy offwhite mid-sized head. Dark red translucent body. Dusty earthy chocolate aroma with strong barnyard notes and dry, peppery notes. Watery dry cocoa powder and earth taste with hardly any aftertaste. Faint pea-like mealy chocolate taste lingers. This beer would have benefited from more body; a heavier, stronger version could have been a fantastic beer. (0.75l bottle from Fenaknoken in Oslo. BB was March 2007.)",14
"Medium fine-laced white head. Orange body with slight haze. Very harmonic aroma--hard to analyze. Tropical fruit, tobacco, and subtle, light dusty balanced spices. Orange, wood, and pepper. Taste is milky acidic tobacco with tropical fruit notes and chalk. Bitter dandelion aftertaste. Not bad, but it's possible the bottle was too old. Should re-rate to be sure. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Thin white head disappears quickly, leaving just a thin white ring. Hazy ruby red body. Sour, metallic, mealy lambic aroma with faint cherry background. Taste is again sour, dry metal with a sharp powdery mouthfeel. Extremely thin-bodied. Just hints of cherry, mainly in the aftertaste. A challenging beer to drink, and interesting, but a bit disappointing as a kriek. Seems to me it makes little difference that the cherries were grown in Schaerbeek when you can hardly taste them anyway. (0.75l bottle, thanks to gr0ve.)",13
"Largish white head. Hazy milky yellow body. Light citric mealy banana aroma. Chalky, milky citric banana taste that goes slightly bitter at the end. Dryish. A decent weizen; more bitter than usual. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Small white head. Amber body with a slight haze. Mild nutty hop aroma with something funny in the background kind of like gasoline (may be because the beer is 9 months past the sell-by date). Taste is watery chalky paper and bitterness. It must be too old, so I'm rating it a bit leniently, given that I'll probably never be able to re-rate. This probably was a nice bitter when they bottled it. (0.5l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)",10
"Medium offwhite fine-laced head. Darkish red-brown body. Sweetish dusty caramel and cinnamon aroma with earthy notes. Earthy cinnamon taste with roasty notes. Bitterish throughout. Bitter, metallic aftertaste. Thin-bodied. Not too well balanced, but drinkable. (1.5l plastic bottle.)",8
"Medium white fine-laced head. Greenish yellow body. Peppery hop aroma with rubber notes and some light malts. Taste is light, clean grass, faintly sweetish, with bitter, papery aftertaste. The bitter, papery taste lingers unpleasantly. An OK pilsener, but spoiled by that aftertaste. (1.5l plastic bottle.)",4
"Medium light beige head over hazy reddish brown body. Light rubbery aroma. Taste is acidic tobacco with notes of paper and chalk. This is useless. I wonder if my bottle was off, given how highly others have rated this beer. I should find another and rerate. (0.33l bottle.)",3
"Small white head. Faintly hazy yellow body. Firm, harmonic sweetish aroma of tropical fruit with soft marzipan notes and a touch of alcohol. Taste is deep, sweet marzipan (and possibly chocolate) with notes of hops and something reminiscent of tobacco. Very smooth and harmonic, and quite bitter. Bitter, chalky aftertaste with strong hop notes. Very nice! (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Tiny white head. Deep copper body. Complex, smoky aroma of alcohol, tobacco, and tropical fruit with notes of peas. Taste is intensely acidic tobacco with lemony aftertaste. Reminiscent of tobacoo lambic. This is awful. I'm not sure if that's because making beer from mustard is just plain dumb, or whether it's because the bottle is too old. I should get another one and re-rate. (0.33l bottle.)",3
"Huge offwhite coarse head. Dark red body that's kind of opaque, possibly because it's hazy. Harmonic vinuous licorice aroma with spicy, yeasty notes. Deep, harmonic, bitter licorice taste with chocolate notes and a touch of bread. Dry, almost floral aftertaste. Relatively straightforward and a bit watery. Good, and drinkable, but nothing major. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Big white head; hazy orange body. Acidic, wheaty, peppery aroma with light citric notes. Taste is citric, milky wheat with yeasty, dusty notes. Dusty, powdery mouthfeel. Faintly dry aftertaste. Some spice as well. A decent weizen, but nothing special. (0.5l can.)",12
"Enormous offwhite head over orange body. Delicate aroma of stale hops, metal, and tropical fruit. Taste is powerful tropical fruit overlaid with metallic, stale hops and spice. Dry, astringent spice aftertaste. Very difficult to characterize, and quite complex. Very unusual, but nice, with lots of character. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Small light beige head. Dark red translucent body. Tight vinuous peppery aroma of licorice and alcohol with notes of chocolate. Quite harmonic. Taste is deep, sweet licorice and chocolate, with strong spicy notes, and a cardamom finish. Very harmonic, and hard to analyze, but very, very nice. Quite a bit of alcohol heat, and you can taste a little alcohol as well. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Big coarse beige head. Dark red translucent body with ongoing carbonation. Peppery caramelly aroma with notes of milk and paper. Taste is powerful acidic smoky caramel with a bitter grassy aftertaste. Smoky taste lingers. Slightly sickly metallic-like off-taste, with notes of wild berries. Quite a bit of taste, but somehow it doesn't appeal very much. Could be the acidity. (0.5l can.)",10
"Big white head shrinks quickly. Pale yellow body. Very light marzipany aroma, otherwise nothing. Taste is pretty much the same; only just detectable. Some slight acidity as well, and perhaps traces of hops. As an ice beer, this is quite successful: there's hardly any taste, and no off tastes. As a beer, it's dreadfully boring. Choose something else. (0.5l can. Labelled Mack Ice.)",9
"Small white head quickly disappears. Dark reddish brown body. Yeasty, hoppy aroma reminiscent of peas with faint smoky notes. Taste is dominated by the same yeasty, hoppy, pea-like flavour with some smoke in it, and perhaps some chocolate notes at the far back. Dry, grassy aftertaste. Very unusual taste, but not bad. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Biggish offwhite head over dark red body. Deep, sharpish banana aroma with notes of licorice and spice, and, very faintly, traces of alcohol. Taste is again a deep, sharpish, harmonic mix of banana and licorice with bread, yeast, and peppery spice notes. Very complex. Smooth mouthfeel. Dry, peppery licorice aftertaste with yeast notes. Quite a bit of alcohol heat. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Big white head with holes from larger bubbles. Copper body. Clean, sweetish malty aroma with caramel notes and resiny hop background. Taste is a bit hoppy initially, then soft caramel malts make their entrance, before the hops take over again, and bring up a dry, grassy rear. Soft, smooth mouthfeel. A decent industrial lager. (0.5l can.)",11
"Huge white coarse head collapses quickly, leaving a thin white film (with white lumpy-looking islands of denser foam) over a yellow body. Faintly malty aroma with slight grassy notes. Taste is thin, acidic caramel with a buttery, metallic aftertaste. Some dryness lingers, together with a foul bitter rubbery taste. Yuck! This is really crap. Replacing this with Stella and Tiger would be a real step forward. (0.33l can. Thanks to Knut Albert for the can!)",2
"Small white head; copper body with a little bit of carbonation. Clean, slightly acidic aroma with notes of apple. Taste is light and clean, mostly caramel and marzipan with apple notes and a touch of grass. Slightly dry grassy and faintly metallic aftertaste. Light and refreshing to drink. A perfectly decent lager. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Biggish offwhite head. Dark red translucent body. Harmonic spicy banana licorice aroma. Sweet, harmonic spicy banana licorice taste with cinnamon notes. Bitter licorice finish. Dry licorice taste lingers. Very good! Complex and powerful, but still easily drinkable. (0.75l bottle.)",15
"Huge creamy white lasting head. Pale yellow body with very light haze. Light sweetish peppery hop aroma with a sharpish edge that's probably the alcohol, with light fruity notes. Acidic, soft malty taste with soft metallic edge and light stale hop notes. Delicate, dryish marzipan finish. Very good, but doesn't really taste that much. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Big offwhite creamy head. Dark red translucent body. Faint, sweet caramelly aroma with faint hop background. Taste is smoky, sweetish caramel malts with some roastiness. Bitter, smoky finish with grassy hop notes. It&#8217;s a bit dry and harsh, but not bad. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Medium creamy offwhite head. Light brown body. Light, fruity caramelly aroma with cinnamon notes. Taste is again light caramel with strong cinnamon notes and a touch of paper. Slightly watery mouthfeel. Some floral hops and bitterness in the aftertaste. Not bad, but could have more taste. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Big offwhite head. Deep orange body full of small yeast particles. Subtle, sweetish light peppery metal hop aroma with spice notes with notes of pine needles and stale hops. Sourish intense bitter taste of resin, pine needles, and citrus with dry, citric finish. Faintly medicinal tinge. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Excellent, if challenging. (0.75l bottle.)",15
"Big creamy offwhite head with a rash of larger bubbles in the middle. Dark red, translucent body, rather like red wine. Sweetish, faintly earthy, milky caramel aroma with lightly grassy hop aroma. Harmonic. Sweet chocolatey licorice taste with milky cinnamon notes. Bitterish aftertaste with grassy notes. Extremely smooth, but a bit cloying. Quite nice. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"  Big creamy, shiny white head. Light yellow body. Thin, rubbery aroma. Taste is light rubber with faint notes of apple and malts and a thin, sourish faintly salty aftertaste. Interesting. This is a definite drain-pour, even though the beer hardly tastes anything at all. (0.5l can.)",4
"Medium white head; clear yellow body with a little carbonation. Deep fruity spicy aroma with tobacco and salt notes. Taste is again tropical fruit, followed by milky, salty bitterness. Sourish. Watery and one-dimensional. Boring, and not too good. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Big dark brown head over body that's opaque black, except for dark red at edges. Sweet chocolatey aroma with milk notes. Taste is sweet and milky, with chocolatey roasty notes, and bitterish caramel and chocolate finish. Nice, mellow, and easy to drink, without too much complexity or challenge. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Medium offwhite head; faintly hazy dark orange body with carbonation. Sweet spicy apricot aroma, quite light, with an unidentifiable off taste in the background. Taste is bittersweet fruit with a wooden pine needle finish. Body is thin (but OK). A really nice one. (0.33l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)",15
"Small coarse white head; orange body with carbonation. Sweetish milky apple aroma with rubber notes. Sweetish caramelly apple with faintly dry metallic finish. A decent pilsener with a bit more malts than usual. Boring, though. (0.33l bottle, thanks to KnutAlbert.)",10
"Small white head; hazy yellow body with yeast floaties. Aroma of apple, alcohol, licorice and peppery hops with notes of cough juice. Taste is again licorice, apple, cough jouce, and metallic hop notes. Bitter marzipan aftertaste. Pretty light overall. Quite good, but a bit too bitter and medicinal for me, with not enough to offer to make up for it. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Big beige creamy lasting head, black opaque body. Faint acidic wheaty aroma with earthy licorice notes. Taste is light earthy wheat with a bitterish chocolatey aftertaste with notes of wild berries. Decent, but a bit boring. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Smallish offwhite head quickly disappears. Dark red barely translucent body. Light licorice and caramel aroma with faintly roasty notes and some fruitiness. Fruity, dry taste of roasty caramel and tobacco. Not too fond of the taste, I have to admit. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Smalish white head; pale yellow body. Strong marzipan aroma with notes of apple and alcohol with bready touches. Taste is firm, yet delicate bitter apple with a metallic caramel finish. Good, but not outstanding. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Small coarse beige head; dark reddish brown body. Sweet licorice aroma with notes of dried plums and cherries. Taste is earthy plums and licorice with an unexpectedly dry tobacco aftertaste. Quite nice, but too thin and dry in the taste to really appeal. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Huge creamy offwhite shiny lasting head. Brown body with carbonation. Light, faintly citric malty aroma. Sweetish dark caramel taste with strong nutty notes and a touch of wood and metal. A bit low on taste, but good all the same. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Shiny creamy offwhite biggish lasting head over light brown body with carbonation. Light bitterish hoppy aroma of caramel with citric tea and traces of nuts. Taste is lightish nutty caramel with a dry aftertaste of roasted almonds. Wooden notes. Notes of citric metallic tea hover above the whole thing. There is also a slight medicinal taste. Very harmonic, and very drinkable. Nice! (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Huge beige coarse head over darkish red-brown body. Light, sweetish grainy aroma with caramel notes. Taste is soft sweetish caramel without too much depth. Dry aftertaste. Decent, but boring. (0.5l can.)",11
"Small coarse white head. Light copper body with carbonation. Complex sweetish aroma of tropical fruit, champagne, and cake. Bitter champagne flavour. Initially there is extreme carbonation in the mouth, which makes it hard to analyze it in any detail, but gradually this settles down. Metal, grain, marzipan, and fruit. Quite a bit of alcohol heat. A bit thin-bodied and harsh for me. (0.375l bottle. Quite old, with yeast particles in the bottle; should probably re-rate at some point. Only rating beer from the top part of the bottle. Had a real struggle opening the wire cage; in the end the wire just broke. They could market this as a negative-calorie beer.)",11
"Small coarse white head disappears immediately. Paleish yellow body with carbonation. Acidic apple-and-malts aroma with a whiff of rubber. Bitterish apple-and-grain taste with a touch of chalk. A nice floral hop profile shows up briefly before being submerged in a bitter dandelion finish. Has nice points, but is too bitter for such a thin-bodied beer. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Medium creamy white head; yellow body. Light sweetish honey aroma. Light, soft sweetish honey taste as well. Dryish finish. Resiny notes. Harmonic and delicate. Honey flavour is a welcome addition to the beer, and complements the taste nicely. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Small shiny white creamy head; brown body. Sweetish caramelly oily aroma with notes of burnt almonds. Sweet powerful licorice and caramel taste with alcohol notes. Dry oily caramel finish. A good bit of alcohol heat. Burnt almond taste lingers. Nice, but very unusual for an English beer. Something earthy and slightly cloying in the taste detracts a bit. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Thin coarse white head; light brown body. Faint hoppy aroma. Light, almost watery, delicately acidic taste. Faint resiny tinge to it, but mostly it's water. Faint dryish finish. Not bad, but too watery. (0.5pt on cask.)",11
"Thin coarse white head rises into a little mound above the rim of the glass. Light brown body. Light, acidic aroma. Light, delicately balanced acidic and bitter taste, nutty and resiny, very harmonic. Lightly dry finish. Smooth, low on taste, easy to drink, and generally very well made. Excellent session beer. (0.5pt on cask.)",14
"Thin white head; faintly hazy pale orange body. Faint sweetish aroma. Light watery taste of apple with dry resiny finish. Subtle citrusy flavours. Strange mouthfeel. It's decent, but nothing great. (0.5pt on cask.)",11
"Thin white head; orange body carbonated on the side of the glass. Light acidic aroma. Light acidic elderberry taste with soft bitter finish. Slightly fruity. Nice, drinkable session beer. (0.5pt on cask.)",13
"Largish shiny offwhite creamy head. Brown body with carbonation. (Strange for a low alcohol.) Light milky, grainy aroma. Milky, grainy taste with a touch of chalk and corn. Kind of watery. This is nothing to be proud of; the Young's light was much better. (0.275l bottle.)",8
"Small white head quickly disappears. Deep dark red body. Sweet, deep, firm grainy malt aroma with licorice and wort notes. Deep sweet corn and figs taste with dark oily hop notes. Dry aftertaste. Excellent! (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Big offwhite creamy shiny head. Hazy deep orange body with carbonation. Light citric hop and softly medicinal aroma. Sweetish citric malt and hop taste with medicinal aftertaste. Nutty, malty notes. Nice! (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Thin white film of a head; deep dark red body, barely translucent. No aroma. Taste is soft and sweet with woody licorice notes. Very mild-tasting. Some alcohol heat. Not bad, but a bit boring. (0.5pt on cask.)",13
No real head. Dark hazy red body. No aroma. Sweet earthy licorice taste with woody notes. Notes of wild berries. Soft mouthfeel. Dry finish. Good! (0.5pt on cask.),15
"Not really any head. Hazy dark red body. Faint wild berry aroma. Sweetish woody wild berry taste with earthy notes. Dryish aftertaste. Nice, but not great. (0.5pt on cask.)",12
"Thin offwhite film for a head. Body looks opaque black, but might actually have a red tinge. Chocolatey aroma. Watery earthy dry licorice taste with notes of wild berries. Dryish aftertaste with some alcohol heat. Nice, but not too great. (0.5pt on cask.)",13
"Small beige head over opaque black body. Light milky burnt licorice aroma. Soft, sweet earthy licorice taste with light burnt aftertaste. Some alcohol heat. Fruity, with banana flavours and notes of milky chocolate. Dry aftertaste. Nice! A beer to savour. (0.5pt on cask.)",15
"Biggish offwhite shiny head over golden body with carbonation. Light clean sweetish caramel and marzipan aroma with apple notes. Taste is sweetish apple and grain with faintly dry and chalky aftertaste. It's decent, but a bit thin and chalky, and could do with more aroma hops and general complexity. Not bad, though. (0.33l bottle.)",11
Thin white head; hazy yellow body. Light citric peas hop aroma (EKG?). Light soft sweetish citric pea hop taste. Light fruit notes. Dry aftertaste. Nice! (0.5pt on cask.),14
"Thin offwhite coarse head; slightly hazy chestnut brown body. No aroma. Soft, light taste of bitter tea, some fruit, and a bit of wood. Sweetish, bitter aftertaste. Quite good. (0.5pt on cask.)",12
"Thin offwhite creamy shiny head. Orange body with carbonation. Sweetish burnt almond aroma. Taste is light burnt almonds and water. Dryish faintly hoppy aftertaste. Decent. (0.275l bottle. This is not a mild, though, but a low alcohol, and a quite good one.)",12
"Thin white head over lightish orange body. Light tea aroma. Light, sweetish delicate tea and citric hops taste with faint, dryish, smoky aftertaste. Nice session beer. (0.5pt on cask. Should rerate.)",12

"Small beige head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Light acidic wild berries aroma. Acidic wild berry taste with dryish aftertaste. Kind of watery. Not much taste, but quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Biggish creamy white head; orange body. Light, vague aroma. Light, acidic taste with a touch of honey and traces of malts. No aftertaste. Boring. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Biggish shiny creamy offwhite head. Hazy dark orange body. Light, acidic aroma. Taste is acidic lemony hops with a soft body and notes of honey. Dryish aftertaste. Good. It's really the hops that make this one. (0.5l bottle.)",14
Small white head; orange body. No aroma. Light sweetish malt taste with notes of wild berries and a light driness. Soft mouthfeel. Not much taste. You could get blind drunk on this pretty easily. (0.5pt on cask.),11
Thin offwhite head; dark reddish brown body. Light nutty aroma. Light sweetish soft nutty malt taste with notes of wild berries. Faintly dry aftertaste. Quite nice. (0.5pt on cask.),13
"Small creamy white head over somewhat hazy orange body. Banana and herb aroma with notes of milk. Delicate banana and apple taste with milky yeast notes. Lightly bitter milk aftertaste. Some herbs as well. Not bad. (0.5pt on tap in Hampstead, London.)",12
Thin white creamy head; chestnut brown body. Faint nutty smoky malt aroma. Taste is soft lightly acidic nutty malts with dry slightly wooden finish. Nice session beer. (0.5pt on cask.),13
"Thin white head; light orange body. No aroma. Sweetish soft apple and tea taste with delicately bitter aftertaste. Lovely session beer, but could have more taste and complexity. (0.5pt on cask.)",13
"Thin beige head; deep dark  reddish brown body, barely translucent. Faint burnt aroma. Soft, lightly acidic, light sooty licorice taste. A little watery. Not bad, but neither is it great. (1pt on cask.)",12
"Thin white coarse head; brown faintly hazy body. Faint hay-and-tea-like aroma. Soft, delicate floral hoppy taste with slightly bitter tea and wild berries aftertaste. Slightly acidic. A nice bitter, but a bit too thin-bodied. (1pt on cask.)",13
"Medium offwhite lasting frothy head over deep hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Citric, smoky hop aroma with notes of tea. Taste is chewy citric tea with dryish aftertaste. Slightly chemical notes in the aftertaste. Quite good. (0.5l bottle served too cold, but gave it a long wait.)",14
"Biggish dark brown lasting head, almost black. Creamy with larger bubbles. Body is pitch black, without a glimmer of light. Deep, sweetish harmonic chocolatey coffee aroma with notes of toffee, chocolate cake, and maybe a touch of wild berries. Deep, smooth burnt chocolate taste with notes of wild berries and pine needle hops. Extremely harmonic, and smooth as velvet. Dryish, chocolatey aftertaste. Leaves coating of complex sugars on the lips. Fantastic! (0.5l bottle.)",18
"Big dark brown frothy lasting head. Seemingly opaque black body, but dark red at edges. Light, acidic harmonic aroma of wild berries and coffee with dryish, dusty notes. Taste is deep acidic coffee with dry, burnt toast aftertaste. Very harmonic. Notes of wild berries and licorice. Lingering burnt chocolate taste. A very good stout, if not perhaps altogether spell-binding. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Huge offwhite coarse head; dark red body. Light, dusty licorice malt aroma. Taste is red berries and licorice with dry, grainy aftertaste. Notes of light marzipan. Very harmonic and drinkable. Slightly dusty mouthfeel, but dryness is attractive. A good dark lager. (0.5l can.)",15
"Big coarse white head disappears almost immediately. Pale yellow body with some carbonation and a slight haze. Earthy, floral aroma with notes of grain. Taste of sweetish straw and fruits and a touch of rubber with floral hops. Dry, floral aftertaste. Very soft mouthfeel. Dry, grainy taste lingers. Good, but not too special. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Big coarse light brown head shrinks rapidly. Dark red body with some carbonation. Sweet licorice aroma with notes of wood and cardamom. Unusual aroma. Sweet, sharpish taste of wood, licorice, and cardamom. Relatively thin-bodied, but lots of taste. Some alcohol heat. This is quite good, but nothing spectacular. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Big coarse offwhite head over dark red slightly hazy and barely translucent body with intense carbonation. Sweetish vinuous spicy aroma, somewhat watery, with notes of wood, bread, and cinnamon. Taste is slightly acidic and vinuous with notes of licorice and wood. Dryish aftertaste. Watery and thin mouthfeel. (0.25l bottle.)",12
"Biggish white head over very pale yellow body. Watery rubbery, papery aroma. Watery, corn-like taste with notes of paper. Better than I expected from the aroma, but still unpleasant. Very little taste, and very flat. (0.33l bottle.)",3
"Big creamy light brown head over pretty deep dark red body with carbonation. Firm, harmonic sweet caramelly cinnamon aroma with marzipan and licorice notes and some pepper. Quite complex. Sweet firm peppery cinnamon licorice taste with dry, caramelly aftertaste with faint hop traces. Smooth mouthfeel, and quite a bit of alcohol heat. Good, but not as good as I remembered it. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"2  Big offwhite fine-laced head over red brown body; looks good, but perhaps a touch watery. Light caramelly aroma with a touch of perfume. Taste is sweet caramel with cinnamon notes. Softly dry aftertaste with peppery notes. Slightly papery licorice taste lingers. This is quite well made, but very low on taste. Not really watery, but soft and understated. A decent beer, I guess. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Small dark brown coarse head; opaque black body barely translucent at edges. Bitter, firm dark coffee aroma with milky caramel notes. Deep coffee taste with notes of soot and hops. Excellent stout. (0.5l bottle.)",16
Small white head; just a thin film. Hazy orange body with carbonation. Sweetish marzipany malt aroma with light milky raspberry finish. Well balanced. Powerful sweet bitter mealy raspberry taste with metallic hoppy aftertaste. Considerable alcohol heat. A good beer. (0.75 bottle.),15
"Medium brown head; opaque black body going dark brown at edges. Sharpish, nutty hop aroma with nilky dark malt notes. Sharp, resiny, bitter, chocolatey licorice taste with faintly oily mouthfeel and citric notes. Dryish aftertaste. Good, quite interesting. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Head is just a thin brown ring. Opaque black body going dark brown at edges. Sweet harmonic perfumy aroma of chocolate, licorice, and toffee with marzipan notes. Deep, coffeeish cocoa and licorice taste with acidic notes and dry chocolatey aftertaste. Excellent. (0.5l bottle.)",17
"Small dark beige head. Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Dried fruit and roasty licorice in the aroma with earthy raisin notes. Dryish roasty licorice taste with earthy chocolate and raisin notes. Metallic, papery traces. Sharp, fizzy mouthfeel. Really very dry and earthy not at all a &quotsoft&quot beer. Nice. (0.5l can, Perhon Koulu, Helsinki. Second rating.)",12
"Offwhite shiny medium head. Light orange body with carbonation. Milky, caramelly aroma with faint earth and paper notes. Sweet, papery, caramelly taste with dry background. Quite good, and clearly well made, but not very complex. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Huge offwhite creamy lasting head with a couple of big bubbles. Hazy dark orange, brownish body with lots of carbonation. Soft, woody, bready aroma with milky notes. Taste is sharpish (but not really sharp) wood with metallic raspberry and oak background. Dry aftertaste. Quite good. (0.75l bottle.)",15
"Almost no head. Ring of offwhite foam. Dark hazy red body with carbonation. Wood and wet paper aroma with stale hop notes. Actually reminiscent of an outdoor toilet, but without the offensive bits. Taste is sharpish wood with alcohol notes, and mild wet paper. Notes of prunes and soft metal. Quite good. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Biggish light brown lasting creamy head with larger bubbles. Dark red hazy body with floaties and lots of carbonation. Soft, acidic vinuous aroma with notes of red berries and oak, and some alcohol. Watery raspberry metal taste with bitter metal aftertaste. Papery raspberry taste lingers. Yuck! This smells good, but the taste is bad. (0.75l bottle.)",7
"Big shiny offwhite lasting head over hazy yellow body with lots of carbonation. Bready, yeasty aroma of fruit and earth, with a sharpish metallic edge and citric notes. Sharp earthy, bananaish taste with dry, ciderlike metallic aftertaste. Lots of carbonation in the mouth. A nice saison. Good, but not too special. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Huge brown head over opaque black body. Deep, soft, slightly acidic aroma of wild berries and licorice. Extremely harmonic. Soft, extremely smooth taste of licorice, burnt malts, and coffee, with some acidity and faint marzipan notes as well as wild berries again. Burnt, chocolatey aftertaste, slightly dry. Fantastic! This is a world classic. (0.355l bottle.)",18
"Huge fine-laced offwhite head over beautiful reddish brown body with some carbonation. Soft caramelly malt aroma with notes of cinnamon and, very faintly, pine needles. Taste is watery roasty caramel with soft pine needle hops and some acidity. Aftertaste is roastiness with some hints of cardboard at the end. A peppery dryness in the mouth lingers. This is a bit thin, but definitely decent, despite the silly marketing. (0.5l can.)",11
"Biggish shiny light brown head over clear reddish brown body with a little carbonation. Spicy, clean, faintly acidic wheat aroma with peppery notes. Taste is again spicy, clean, wheat malts with some citric acidity. Aftertaste is dry, slightly papery, wheat malts and pepper, and, in the background, a good dose of hops. This is a good beer, and without the paper it would really be something. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Head is just thin white film; body greenish yellow with faint carbonation. Dense caramelly earthy malt aroma with some hops. Taste is deep, hoppy malts with notes of straw, grain, and earth. Smooth, faintly oily mouthfeel. Dry, earthy aftertaste. Quite unusual, but once you acquire a taste for it, it&#8217;s nice. (Served way too cold at Cardinal in Stavanger in 0.33l bottle. Rerated at bock festival.)",15
"Small white head over light brown body which is faintly unclear. Light, nutty aroma with hop background. Can't make out any details. Bitter, clean, acidic nutty malty taste. Bitter, dandelion-like aftertaste. A bit thin-bodied. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Huge light brown head over dark red body with surprisingly large floaties, which I assume are yeast. Faint vinuous aroma with sugary notes. Hmmm. Is something wrong with this bottle? Bitter, unbalanced taste of roasty grain and faint wine. Bitter taste lingers. Didn&#8217;t really enjoy this. (0.33l bottle.)  <p><b>Update:</b> It seems clear now that Lervig has been having quality problems. Need to do a rerate of this beer if I can find one that isn&#8217;t infected.",6
"Big light brown shiny head over dark red body. Faint, bready, buttery aroma. Sweet roasty caramel taste with alcoholic, buttery notes. Somewhat watery. Bitter aftertaste. Not easy to say why, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy this too much. It has a bit of taste, but it&#8217;s somewhat unbalanced, and a bit too bitter. Could also do without the butter. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Huge light beige fine-laced head over beautiful dark red body. Light aroma of caramel, roasty malts, and rubber. Taste is harmonic mix of caramel, wild berries, grain, and peppery roastiness, with some acidity. Aftertaste is watery and burnt. Not bad, but not very remarkable, either. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Medium offwhite head. Deep dark red body. Milky, coffeeish aroma with notes of hops. Deep, coffeeish taste with oily mouthfeel. Burnt, caramelly aftertaste. Good. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Medium coarse light beige head. Deep, dark red body, barely translucent. Faint, milky aroma with licorice and marzipan notes. Taste is light, sweetish licorice with roasty notes. Bitterish, coffeeish afteraste. Alcohol notes. Decent. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Smallish offwhite head over deep red body. Sweet, sharpish, wild berry aroma with rye malt notes. Deep, firm malt sweetness. Taste is nutty rye malts with hop background. Bitterish, but not too bitter. Bitter sugary taste lingers. Quite simple, but reasonably good. (0.65l bottle.)",14
"Exploded out of the bottle on opening. Medium white head (after mopping up etc), slightly hazy yellow body. Sharpish aroma of perfume, grapes, spice, soap, and fruit. Very unusual and complex aroma. Taste is sharpish grain, grapes, spice, marzipan, fruit, and most other things. Again very complex. Sharpish, soft, balanced, smooth mouthfeel. Bitter background. (0.75l bottle.)",17
"Huge creamy light beige head over beautiful deep red body with carbonation. Light, caramelly, bready aroma with a slight roasty edge. Roasty, sweetish caramel taste with a slightly watery mouthfeel. Dry, burnt aftertaste. Traces of wild berries. Quite good. (0.5l can.)",13
"Big off-white creamy lasting head, rather like an ice cream. Deep yellow faintly hazy body. Light resiny, fruity, floral aroma. Taste is again light golden malts with an even lighter resiny hop profile. A pity; the previous version of this beer was really great. Resiny, floral, bitter aftertaste, with a dusty malt feel to it. A bit too thin-bodied. A good, drinkable IPA, but could have a lot more aroma and sharpness to it. Served too cold. (0.5l on tap.)",14
"Medium white body. Red body with carbonation and faint haziness. Acidic harmonic aroma of wild berries and bread. Slightly odd. Bitter, resiny hop taste initially, followed by dry roasty malt taste. Bitter taste lingers. Hmmmm. They must have put quite a bit of hops into this, maybe more than suits such a thin-bodied beer. Quite good, and very drinkable. Served too cold, as usual. (0.5l on tap.)",13
"Big brown head over opaque black body. Complex, harmonic sweetish aroma of peppery coffee, burnt malts, pine needles, and chocolate. Taste is soft, harmonic burntness, coffee, chocolate, and pine needles with faint vanilla and spice notes. Bitter, burnt aftertaste. Woody notes linger. Good, firm mouthfeel, yet soft. This is a great beer. Kind of like a very good spicy stout. (0.5l bottle, batch 258.)",16
"Biggish coarse offwhite head shrinks quickly. Red body. Light roasty, harmonic aroma with notes of peas and faint sweetness. Taste is very similar, a mix of roastiness, peas and a light bitterness. Watery aftertaste. The roasty bitterness lingers. A decent Christmas beer. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Big offwhite head shrinks rapidly. Red body with some carbonation. Light rubbery aroma, possibly with a hint of roastiness behind the rubber. Taste is watery bitter rubber with roasty, grainy aftertaste. Too watery for my taste, and definitely too much rubber. Yuck. I'd rather have a decent pilsener with my Christmas dinner. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Big coarse light brown head, creamy on top. Deep red body with some carbonation. Faint, but relatively firm, sweetish aroma of roasty malts, licorice, and some form of spice, with notes of butter. Taste is sweetish butter and cinnamon with a watery, roasty malt aftertaste. Dry, roasty taste lingers. Smooth, yet watery mouthfeel. This is better than most Norwegian pilseners, but pretty boring for a Christmas beer. Nothing really wrong with it, though. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Huge creamy white shiny head over pale copper body with a faint haze and a very slight carbonation. Light, sweetish malty aroma with complex hoppy background with notes of resin. Taste is lovely bitterish and sweetish malts with grain and straw notes and a strong hoppy background. Aftertaste is bitter grain and dandelion. This is an excellent beer, but perhaps a bit too austerely bitter in the aftertaste. I would have given it an 8 for flavour if it wasn't for that. (0.5l bottle, thanks to gr0ve.)",15
"Small offwhite head over brown body. Rounded, bready, caramelly aroma with notes of licorice and spice, and a touch of alcohol. Deep, sweet, rounded licorice and alcohol taste with spice and herb notes. Smooth, buttery mouthfeel. It&#8217;s interesting, but not too good. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Small white creamy head over copper body with carbonation. Rubbery aroma. (What's this? Kulmbacher used to a good brewery!) Taste is smooth, rubbery caramel with a hoppy background. Drinkable, but no more. Really confused about the rubber. Should try another one. (0.5l bottle.)",6
"Small offwhite head over deep dark red body like red wine, except for the slight carbonation. Light, soft licorice aroma, barely detectable. Sweet, roasty taste. Again very weak. Faintly dry aftertaste. Nothing wrong with it, but there's hardly any taste here. (0.33l bottle.)",9
"Medium offwhite shiny lasting creamy head over brown body with carbonation. Very faint aroma with traces of caramel and wood. Thin watery taste of something that could possibly be caramel malts. There are traces of typical English hops, too. So watery it tastes bad, but there are no off tastes. This sucks. (0.5l can, thanks to Knut Albert.)",7
"Medium light brown head; opaque black body. Firm, spicy, harmonic aroma of wood, cloves, and pine needles. Firm, harmonic woody taste of pepper, cloves, and hops. Very soft, smooth and well-rounded. Has a sharpish burnt edge as well, which kind of defines the beer. Very nice, and highly drinkable. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Medium beige head disappears quickly. Dark red body. Faint, sweet, buttery aroma. Very little aroma. Soft, sweetish buttery taste and faintly roasty aftertaste. Very little taste. Disappointing! Boring and nondescript. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Medium beige head over deep red body with carbonation. Very light licorice aroma. Taste is light licorice. Smooth mouthfeel. Some sweetness, but overall very little taste. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Medium beige head over dep dark red body with carbonation. Light sweet milky caramelly aroma with alcohol and earth notes. Roasty, slightly burnt licorice taste with acidic, bitter background. Dry, roasty aftertaste. Not that much taste, really. Good, but kind of boring. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Small white head; pale yellow body with carbonation. Faint sweetish aroma with honey-like aspects, but really kind of bland. Alcohol-like notes. Intensely sweet light honey taste with gingery, sugary notes and strong alcohol or vodka notes. Slick, buttery mouthfeel. Too sweet, and there isn't enough to balance the sweetness. Drinkable. Interesting, but I wouldn't drink a lot of this. (0.5l bottle.)",9
"Thin white head quickly disappears entirely. Hazy yellow body. Sweetish yoghurty honey aroma, with alcohol notes. Taste is sweet, gingery honey with yeasty, alcoholic notes and traces of sugar. Sharpish, slick, buttery mouthfeel, sharp and clean. Unusual taste. Quite interesting, and quite good. (0.33l plastic bottle.)",15
"No head. Hazy light brown body, like boiled honey. Soft sweetish aroma of cognac, honey, and flowers with marzipan notes. Strong, sweet honey taste with apricot liquor notes. Some acidity, which keeps it from being too sweet. Harmonic and balanced. Smooth, silky mouthfeel. Excellent! Really nice. (0.33l plastic bottle.)",15
"Largish light beige head; faintly hazy red body. Deep, dense, dry malty, straw sweetnesss with notes of cinnamon and floral hops. Deep, intense, sweet oily roasty malts with dry, floral hop aftertaste. Clean, broad, oily mouthfeel. Excellent! A great beer. (0.655l bottle.)",16
"Medium shiny beige head over dark red barely translucent body. Sweet roasty licorice aroma with faint raspberry notes. Taste is soft, smooth sweetish roasty licorice with chocolatey notes. Like a schwarzbier, but with more taste. Nice, a really good effor, despite the clear industrial taste. (0.655l bottle.)",15
"Biggish head over red body. Strawberry aroma with sharpish metallic beer background. Taste is deep, intense, powerful bubblegum, metallic, natural, bitter strawberries with acidic, aftertaste. Incredibly strong taste; rarely knew anything like it. Really good, and wildly unusual. (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Medium beige head. Very deep dark red, barely translucent body in the middle. Sweet licorice aroma with roasty and faint vanilla aroma notes. Deep, roasty, licorice taste. Clean, oily and smooth, thinnish body, very industrial. Dryish, licorice aftertaste. Somewhat acidic grain. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.) ",14
"Small beige head shrinks rapidly into hazy red-brown body. Deep, dark, firm oily rye aroma, faintly acidic. Deep, sweet gingery roasty rye and yeast taste, with faint bread notes. Acidic, dryish soft drink aftertaste. A good kvas, if not outstanding. (0.5l can.)",13
"Big offwhite lasting head over deep brown body with some carbonation. Sharpish, oily, roasty citric hop aroma. Taste is deep, intense dry rye and citric hops with burnt roasty malt notes. Burning bitterness. Dry, burnt aftertaste. Fantastic! (0.65l bottle.)",17
"Big, dark brown lasting head over opaque black body. Sweetish, roasty aroma with notes of bitterness. Rounded. Smooth, rounded roasty and burnt malt taste with coffeeish, oily, chocolatey notes. Wide-bodied, smooth, oily, rounded. Bitter, burnt toast aftertaste. Excellent! A beautiful porter. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Big coarse white head over slightly hazy yellow body. Light citric hop aroma. (Bottle claims the hop is Saaz, but it doesn't smell at all like it.) Light, sweetish, bitter taste of resiny hops, with a dry aftertaste. Clean, crisp mouthfeel. Excellent pilsener, one of the best I've tasted, if you can call this a pilsener at all. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Biggish offwhite head over brown body with carbonation. Soft, grainy aroma of dry straw. Bitter, sweetish taste of caramel, faintly roasty malts, and straw. Dry caramel taste lingers. It doesn't really taste like a real beer, but it's not bad, either. I guess if what you are looking for is a substitute for normal Christmas beer, this isn't it, but if you just want something beerlike without alcohol it might work just fine. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Head comes out of the bottle when you open it. Medium white head over hazy white body with a yellow tinge. Sweet coconut aroma with a sharp artificial marzipan-like background. Taste is sweet coconut with the same sharpish artificial taste behind it, and a quite powerful bitter, metallic hop ending. Milky mouthfeel and taste. It's not awful like the banana thing, but the bitterness doesn't go very well with the coconut taste. Drinkable. (0.33l bottle.)",6
"Small white head over hazy yellow body. Sweet banana aroma, initially fine, then followed by a disgusting papery, milky background with faint notes of licorice. The taste also starts out well with sweet banana, then lurches into a violent taste of wet toilet paper, licorice, metal, rotten banana, and, I swear, a whiff of shit. This is just absolutely dreadful. It fails to be boring in the same way that axe murders fail to be boring. I&#8217;ve only taken two sips, so I can&#8217;t analyze the taste very well, but there is no way I am drinking any more of this. This sets a new low for me. It&#8217;s a shame it looked OK, since giving it a 1 for appearance would have made me happy. (0.33l bottle.)",1
"Medium white head over pale yellow body. Rubbery aroma with notes of wet cardboard and something that reminds me of sweaty socks. Bitter rubbery, watery taste of grain and metal. The wateriness makes it really disgusting. A lingering taste not entirely unlike vomit. Chalky, mouthfeel a little like acid. Vaguely, at the back, there are traces of floral hops. This is crap. If you don't want to get drunk, drink water. Poured out the rest. (0.33l bottle.)",3
"Medium offwhite head over deep reddish brown body. Sweetish malty aroma of rock candy. Reminiscent of the other Munkholm Spesial, but fainter and less complex. Taste is watery roasty malts and brown sugar with a touch of cardboard and straw. Some bitterness in the aftertaste. It's OK, but nothing special. Better than most in the Munkholm range. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Medium offwhite head over pretty chestnut brown body. A bit light for a Christmas beer. Sweet malty aroma with notes of rock candy, cinnamon, and a little straw. Taste is sweet watery cardboard, with a dry, bitter metal aftertaste. Very low on taste, but apart from the metal there isn't much in the way of off tastes, either. Not bad. In fact, probably the best beer in the Munkholm series. (0.33l bottle.)",9
"Small white head quickly dissolves. Deep yellow body. Sweet watery caramel aroma with marzipan notes, disappointingly weak and simple. Sweetish watery taste with grain notes. Dry metallic aftertaste. Well. This wasn't very exciting. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Small white head shrinks into thin white ring. Yellow body. Sweetish vaguely caramelly and maybe grassy alcoholic aroma. Sweetish grassy caramelly malt taste. Dry, grassy aftertaste. The hoppy background runs throughout the entire taste. This isn't a great beer, but it's not bad, either. It's the hops that make it, really. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Small offwhite coarse head quickly dissolves into nothing. Opaque black body. Faint, sweetish licorice aroma. Sweet, watery, grainy taste with licorice and straw notes, but no balancing bitterness. Clean, but noring, with a kind of flat, empty taste. Could be a reasonable Oud Bruin for all  I know. (0.33l bottle.)",9
"Biggish offwhite head over chestnut brown body. Faint, sweetish aroma with notes alcohol, caramel, and a little grass. Taste is sweet roasty caramel with notes of grass and marzipan. Slick, slightly buttery mouthfeel. Watery aftertaste with some bitterness, lingering alcohol taste and some alcohol heat. Quite good if warm, but a bit much alcohol. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Biggish beige head over deep dark red body, barely translucent. Sweetish milky caramel aroma with harmonic chocolate and roasty notes and a faint background of wood and pine needle hops. Deep, soft milky roasty caramel and chocolate taste. Very harmonic and incredibly smooth, like velvet. Sharpish pine needle background, and a touch of soot. Dry, roasty aftertaste with chocolatey notes. Wonderful! What a pleasure this beer is, especially after rating so much bullshit. (0.33l bottle. Wish it was an 0.75.)",17
"Medium white coarse head quickly shrinks. Bronze body. Aroma of rubber, with touches of alcohol and hops. Sweetish malty taste with milky background in which I think I can make out some alcohol. Watery and faintly hoppy aftertaste. Unpleasant watery caramel in the aftertaste. I don't think I need any more of this one. (0.33l bottle.)",6
"Medium white coarse head quickly shrinks. Bronze body. Aroma of rubber, with touches of alcohol and hops. Sweetish malty taste with milky background in which I think I can make out some alcohol. Watery and faintly hoppy aftertaste. Unpleasant watery caramel in the aftertaste. I don't think I need any more of this one. Maybe if they'd used a 600-meter deep well, and been brewing for 1400 years, this would have been better. (0.33l bottle.)",6
"Big white head shrinks quickly. Clear bronze body. Unbalanced watery grainy caramel soup aroma with notes of alcohol. Taste is mostly cardboard with some sweetish malts and a bit of hops in the background. Aftertaste is dry and chalky. The aroma almost scared me off, but the beer is actually drinkable, if not exactly great. (0.5l bottle found in a grocery store in Prague.)",8
"Big creamy offwhite head with some larger bubbles. Bronze body with some carbonation. Sweetish, grainy aroma with notes of perfume and marzipan, with a whiff of rubber and some alcohol. Strong sweet malty and grainy taste with hoppy notes and a touch of caramel. Very smooth mouthfeel, almost a bit oily. Dry, metallic aftertaste with roasty notes and some chalk. Quite a bit of taste, so even if I'm not too fond of all the components of the taste, at least the beer isn't boring. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Big light brown head shrinks quickly. Muddy dark brown body. Wheaty, peppery, chocolatey aroma with yeast notes. A bit musty and unbalanced. Sweet, chocolatey taste with wheaty, grainy notes and carbonation in the mouth. Dry aftertaste. Somewhat watery. Quite good. (0.5l bottle bought at Finnish Alko.)",13
"Medium dark beige coarse head; seemingly black body goes dark red at edges. Sweet, milky, toffeeish aroma with caramel and chocolate notes. Harmonic. Roasty, acidic taste with notes of chalk and smoke. Very thin-bodied. Dry, metallic-smoky aftertaste. Disappointing. The aroma is good, but the beer is just too thin. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium creamy white head; golden body with carbonation. Clean, light malty aroma with faint resiny notes. Taste is clean, light malts with faint notes of apple and paper. Smooth, clean mouthfeel, but low on taste in general, and thin-bodied. A decent pale lager. (0.33l can.)",10
"Medium offwhite head; muddy brown body with carbonation. Light spicy, peppery, yeasty aroma with sweet notes. Taste is light, milky spice and pepper with a dry, yeasty aftertaste. Clean, complex, and interesting. Good! (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Big creamy white head; yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet perfumy aroma with notes of apple. Taste is papery apple with a watery bitter aftertaste, leaving a strong papery off-taste in the mouth. Has good sides, but could do without the paper. (0.4l on tap.)",7
"Medium shiny creamy white head; brown hazy body with carbonation. Sweet malty aroma with notes of straw and grass. Strong, earthy malt and straw taste with toffeeish notes and a dry, hoppy background. Powerful, yet light and drinkable. Good! (0.5l on tap.)",15
"No head, just a coarse white ring around the edge. Deep dark hazy brown body. Sweetish, smoky, floral aroma reminiscent of roses with notes of berries. Somewhat unbalanced. Sweet watery taste of flowers and earth, strongly spicy, with notes of cardamom and licorice. Complex and interesting, but somehow it makes me feel sick. I&#8217;m giving it a poor rating here, but that may simply be because something in it happens to disagree violently with me in a way it might not with others. &#40;0.33l bottle. Rated again 2009-03, with same results.&#41;",8
"Small white coarse head over deep golden body. Light pine needle hop aroma with notes of clean, dry straw. Taste is light, clean malts with a dry, bitter floral and resiny hoppy aftertaste. A bit thin-bodied, but the hop profile is nice. Quite good. (0.5l from cask.)",14

Taste is chocolatey licorice with yeast notes and alcohol heat. Lots of carbonation in the mouth initially. Sweet. Slightly watery. Dry licorice aftertaste. Good but not as good as the &quot;regular&quot; Barbar. (0.33l bottle.)",15

"Big coarse beige head; deep dark red body. Sugary sweet aroma with notes of licorice and hops. Sweet syrupy licorice taste with dry, smoky, hoppy background. Dry licorice and hop aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit sweet, and a bit lacking in complexity. (0.3l bottle.)",13
"Big white creamy head over clear golden body. Clear, golden deep hop aroma of tropical flowers, fruit, metal, and a touch of smoke. Taste is again flowers and fruit with lots more of the smoke. Quite bitter. Dry, hoppy, metallic aftertaste. Very nice! (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Medium white head; yellow body. Faint clean malty aroma. Taste is clean malts with delicate citric hoppy aftertaste. The hop profile is nice, and kind of makes the beer, but other than that there is hardly any taste to the beer at all. (0.33l bottle.)",11
Big creamy white head shrinks quickly. Yellow body. No discernible aroma. Watery faint malty taste with a touch of spice. Boring. (0.33l bottle.),9
"Biggish coarse white head quickly shrinks. Pale yellow body with a little carbonation. Clean hoppy aroma with notes of apple. Taste is clean and crisp with sharp, well-defined hop notes. Watery aftertaste with notes of cardboard. Notes of chalk and some acidity. It's decent, the hops are quite nice, but I could do without the cardboard, and a little more taste would be nice.

"Small white head quickly disappears entirely, leaving just an unattractive film. Very pale yellow body with a little carbonation. Faint, thin, mealy, apple-ish aroma with rubbery notes. Taste is clean and crisp, with a bitter, chalky apple-like aftertaste. Very little body. Surprisingly bitter, for a beer that is so low on taste in every other respect. Refreshing, and attractively crisp, but still not much of an achievement in my book. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Medium white creamy head; golden yellow body. Aroma of chalk, grain, and floral hops, and perhaps a touch of urine. Clear, crisp, slightly acidic, faintly chalky taste. Hoppy aftertaste, but no noticeable bitterness. Light-bodied, drinkable, and, except for the hops, boring. (0.3l on tap.)",10

"Medium white head over hazy light orange body. Light fruity aroma with grassy hop notes and some sweetness. Taste is bitter, grassy hops with aftertaste of resiny, honey-like sweetness. Quite a lot of hops in this one, but it's very nice. Good balance, and very interesting character. Not a typical blond at all (because of the hops). I like it! (0.3l on draft.)",16
"Small light beige head; deep dark red body with ongoing carbonation. Acidic vinuous aroma with notes of wood and some tartness. Taste is deep acidic and wine-like, with notes of wood and a balancing sweetness. Very complex, yet harmonic. Tart aftertaste of wood. Excellent balance. Intense, acidic palate which is at the same time surprisingly clean for a sour beer. This is a great beer. (0.25l bottle.)",17

"Huge offwhite creamy head shrinks quickly towards a copper body. Complex, harmonic aroma of floral hops, honey, rubber, and wet paper. It's good, but there is some not so good mixed in. Taste is deep, flowery honey, with smoky, citric notes, and touches of paper. Aftertaste is dry papery malts. Slightly lacking in body. Not at all bad. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Huge offwhite head over chestnut brown body. Relatively light sweetish fruity aroma with notes of metal, wood, cinnamon, and pine needles. Taste is sweetish vinuous and somewhat watery with roasty wood and metal notes. It's OK, but nothing very special. (0.5l bottle.)",14

Some vanilla, oily burnt toast, and chocolate. Quite soft and mellow taste. Soft, mealy mouthfeel. A dark, burnt coffee taste settles in the mouth as you drink. Good. A nice, easy session beer that also works for sipping. (0.5l bottle, batch #298. Updated batch #359.)",13

Aftertaste is dry, peppery hops. Light-bodied. Soft mouthfeel. Not at all bad. I would prefer this over many beers with alcohol. Sampled relatively warm. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Big shiny white coarse head over pale yellow body with fast carbonation. Faint grainy, rubbery aroma with notes of apple, with something of an unpleasant edge to it. Taste is clean, bitter dry straw with notes of rubber and paper. Dry, papery taste lingers. Very watery and lacking in body. I can't quite make my mind up about this one; it has some things that feel like off tastes, but on the other hand it seems pretty clean. The sharpness of the bitterness makes it difficult to like, though. Overall, I think the thumb is down. (0.5l can.)",6
"Huge white coarse head over pale yellow body. Light sweetish aroma with notes of caramel, grain, and apple. Light, bitter taste of apple and chalk. Bitter, papery, grainy aftertaste. A bit lacking in body. Totally standard lager; a bit boring for a German pilsener. (0.5l can.)",8
"Small coarse offwhite head quickly disappears. Body is beautiful dark red. Sweetish, aroma of licorice and malts with indistinct hoppy notes. Something stale and muddy in the aroma prevents it from getting top scores. Taste is sweetish, watery licorice with the same stale, muddy off taste. Dryish aftertaste. Best before date is 07.07.06, which was around the time when we bought it at Ølbutikken in Copenhagen. Giving it slightly better marks than it deserves to make up for this. Need to rerate this one. (0.6l bottle.)",11
"Raises big white coarse head over pale golden body. Strong rubbery aroma with notes of milk. Taste is crisp grain with hoppy, rubbery background. Chalky, mealy mouthfeel. Very thin and watery. Well, it could be worse. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Small offwhite head over muddy dark body. Intense, tropical fruit aroma with smoky notes and the warm sweet malt touch that's characteristic of North Coast. Powerfully sweet, malt caramel taste with milky notes and some alcohol heat. Some spice as well. Quite bitter, but this is well masked by the rest. Dryish, fruity aftertaste. Very good, but perhaps a bit lacking in complexity. Could also do with more power, and more Belgian-style hopping. Still, a very good beer. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Smallish white head over hazy dark orange body. Milky, malty aroma with faint citric notes. Taste is sweet, tropical fruit and caramel with delicate, milky, metallic bitterness. Dry, mealy taste lingers. Very harmonic, and just enough body. Some spiciness and Belgian-like hops. Nice and interesting! (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Big creamy offwhite head over clear yellow body. Grassy, faintly sweetish aroma, with some malt and rubber. Soft taste of malts, maize, and grain, with some chalky bitterness. Strange metallic bitterness lingers. No real body. The above review probably makes this beer sound quite good, but somehow I didn't really enjoy it. (0.5l can.)",7
"Biggish, creamy white head with some larger bubbles. Beautiful, clear pale golden body with some carbonation. Faint, oily, earthy aroma with some funny notes that are too weak to be made out. Taste is initially deep, sweetish, and bitter, then powerfully earthy with pea-like notes. Dry, metallic, grainy aftertaste. Rough, metallic mouthfeel. Wow! A pilsener that really tastes a lot. I don't think it's really a great beer, but nobody can fault them for being too bland. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Medium white head shrinks quickly. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Sweetish soft caramelly aroma with butter notes. Light, bitter, sweetish taste with floral hop notes (wow! in a Norwegian lager!). Unfortunately, an acidic papery aftertaste with notes of grain and chalk appears after the more promising initial taste. Thin-bodied. Further down the bottle a sour, unpleasant aftertaste emerges. Yuck. (0.33l bottle.)",6
"Big white head quickly shrinks into a thin ring. Pale yellow body with some carbonation. Vaguely sulphurous chalky aroma with something I won't bother to identify, because this smells horrible anyway. Taste is chalky watery bitterness initially. Aftertaste is watery bitterness. Very unpleasant. I can't imagine that anyone would enjoy this. It reminds me of what you vomit when you've only water in your stomach. (0.5l bottle.)",1
"Small offwhite head quickly shrinks into thin film. Deep, dark, reddish brown hazy body. No aroma that I can make out in this smoky brewpub. Taste is sweetish, watery licorice, with a dryish aftertaste. Faint peppery notes. Hoppy background. (0.35l on tap.)",12
"Big creamy white lasting head; hazy dark orange body. Aroma with sweet and acidic notes, within an unimportant distance of being undetectable. Sweet milky taste with acidic, almost tart aftertaste. Body maybe a bit thin. Mealy, yeasty notes, as well as something citric in the aftertaste. Nice, but maybe a bit too tart. (0.3l on tap.)",12
"No head whatsoever. Dark brown, almost black, opaque body. Sweetish, gingery aroma with roasty notes of dark rye bread, with maybe a touch of cinnamon and caramel. Taste is watery ginger and mild roasty bread. No aftertaste. Soft and silky mouthfeel. Harmonic. Reminiscent of traditional Norwegian homebrew like my grandfather made, but of higher quality. Very nice, if not earthshattering. (0.3l, but whether from draft or bottle is not clear.)",13
"No head. Clear yellow body with some carbonation. Light grassy hop aroma with faint malt notes. Light clean, faintly malty, dryish hoppy taste. Lingering hoppy grassy taste. A very good pilsener. (0.33l bottle. Blind tasted.)",12
"Medium creamy white lasting head. Clear pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Citric banana aroma, faintly tart, acidic and citric, and nothing much else besides. Aftertaste is watery tartness. Disappointing compared to the hefe; too tart. (0.3l on tap.)",10
"Medium white head, yellow body with carbonation. Sweetish resiny aroma with notes of milk. Taste is soft milky chalk with grassy, milky notes. Some bitterness. Aftertaste is dry chalk. Slightly fruit. Ok, but nothing special. (0.5l plastic bottle.)",8

"Medium creamy lasting head over hazy light yellow body with carbonation. Light milky aroma with soft rubbery notes. Taste is grassy bitterness and light malts. Aftertaste is dry, papery rubber. The initial taste is nice, the rest not so good. (0.3l on tap in the Moscow brewpub, where it was listed as &quot;Unfiltered Lager&quot; in the English menu.)",9
"Medium creamy lasting head over clear yellow body with carbonation. Sweet faintly grainy malt aroma with notes of caramel and straw. Taste is sweet straw with grassy hop notes, and the signature Tinkoff papery rubber aftertaste. Not bad, but I&#8217;d prefer to do without the aftertaste. (0.3l on tap in the Moscow brewpub.)",9
"Huge offwhite head over reddish bronze body. Very sweet cinnamon and lefse aroma with maybe a touch of wood to it. Taste is deep, sweet cinnamon, with fruity notes. Aftertaste is dry, slightly metallic hops, with dry wooden notes. Some bitterness, and hops of undefinable character. Definitely a good beer, and quite interesting. A bit too one-dimensional for top marks, though. (0.66l bottle.)",14
"Tiny beige filkm of a head covers half the beer. Opaque black body goes hazy brown at edges. Faint milkiness to an aroma of nothing. Taste is sweet licorice with peppery mouthfeel, and notes of coffee. Some acidity. A bit light, but not bad. Taste could be stronger. Seems Russians want their beers light. (0.35l on tap.)",13
"Biggish offwhite lasting creamy head; deep hazy orange body. Very faint milky aroma. Taste is strongly spicy, sweetish and milky, with notes of honey. Quite bitter. Dry, bitter, spicy aftertaste. Some pepper. Good. (0.35l on tap.)   This is listed as &quot;Light Special&quot; in the English menu.",13
"Small offwhite coarse head. Light brown body with carbonation. Sweet grain-soup and boiled vegetable aroma, with notes of wet cardboard. Taste is mainly sweetish wet cardboard, turning into powerful cardboard soup at the end, with an awful boiled cabbage off-taste. Dreadful. Didn't finish, even though there is no alcohol, and I'm thirsty. One of the worst beers I've had. (0.5l bottle.)",1
"Big creamy beige head with craters from exploded bubbles. Body is utterly opaque black. Faint milky slightly acidic aroma with notes of rubber. Taste is burnt malt with coffeeish and licorice notes. Milky, peppery mouthfeel. No aftertaste to speak of. Dryish. (0.3l on tap.)",14

"Biggish offwhite head over deep yellow body. Very faint aroma of butter and straw. Sweet very fruity taste with grassy, bitter aftertaste. Quite a bit of taste, but somewhat flat and one-dimensional. I was expecting more from a 17-degree beer. (0.5l bottle.)",10

"Huge white head over copper body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish caramelly aroma with buttery notes. Taste is soft, sweet, buttery caramel, but buttery in a good way. Faintly fruity. Soft, fruty aftertaste. Faintly stale. Decent, but nothing special. (0.5l bottle.)",10

"Big offwhite lasting creamy head; yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, sweetish pine needle aroma. Taste is light and clean, with a soft milky mouthfeel. Sweetish taste, softly bitter, fruity, with an aftertaste of resin and pine needles. Nice, one of the best Ukrainian svitles. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Small offwhite coarse head quickly disappears. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Smoky, meaty, vaguely alcoholic aroma. Taste is deep sweetish smoke with meaty, alcoholic notes. Some grain and bitterness, as well as buttery notes in taste and aroma. Bitter, grainy aftertaste. Quite interesting, but not too great. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Small coarse white head quickly disappears completely. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish watery aroma with alcohol notes. Dense, sweetish fresh taste of grass. Aftertaste is dry grain and resin. Some bitterness. Not bad, but maybe a little low on taste. (0.5l bottle.)",11

"Medium offwhite head; yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet fruity aroma. Taste is again very fruity and sweetish with notes of metal and grass. Quite bitter. Bitter, metallic grassy aftertaste. Some chalk. There are some alcohol notes, but not enough to detract from the beer. With a bit less bitterhops (and some more aroma hops, maybe Amarillo) this could be a really good beer. As it is, it's quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Small offwhite creamy head quickly disappears. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light harmonic sweetish grain aroma, very faint. Taste is sweetish bitter grain with strong notes of chalk. Bitter, chalky aftertaste. Too much bitterness and chalk for me, and not enough else. (0.5l bottle.)",8
"Small white head; pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Grainy, smoky aroma. Taste is deep smoky grain with strong grassy notes, quite bitter. Harmonic, with fruity, citric notes. Chalky, bitter aftertaste. Quite a lot of taste, but still light, drinkable and refreshing. Good! (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Big offwhite creamy head; deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Rubbery grain syrup aroma. Taste is sweetish grain and straw with milky, spicy caramel notes. Lacking in bitterness. It&#8217;s OK, but not as good as a normal pale lager. (0.5l bottle.)",8

"Big offwhite creamy head; hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Citric wheaty aroma. Taste is citric flour and coriander, crisp and refreshing. Tart, mealy aftertaste. Nice! (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Biggish white glossy head over clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light, sweetish grassy aroma. Taste is firm, sweetish, with notes of grass and apple. Clean and smooth. Dry grassy aftertaste. Not bad. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium white head over clear yellow body, with a greenish tinge. Sweet, dense caramelly aroma, with notes of alcohol. Unexpectedly strong aroma. Taste is sweet, grassy hops, with a dry, pine needle aftertaste. Nots of caramel and water. Something stale in the taste detracts from the overall picture. Decent, but still boring. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium white head, yellow body with ongoing carbonation. No aroma at all. Dense, sweetish alcohol taste, with bitter grassy aftertaste. Some spice, reminiscent of pine needles. It'd decent, but I didn't really enjoy it much. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Medium white creamy head with some larger bubbles. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light, clean pine needle aroma. Light sweetish pine needle taste with bitter pine needle aftertaste. Touch of grain as well. Good, refreshing, mainly thanks to the hops. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Very pale yellow body, almost no head. White head quickly disappears entirely. Caramelly, buttery aroma. Almost no taste; vague hints of malts and grass, but nothing more. As such, this could be described as a successful ice beer. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Small offwhite creamy head over deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweetish vegetable aroma. Taste is alcohol with faint bitterness, and a maize-like off taste. Rounded body. Dryish, cider-like aftertaste. Decent, but definitely not an ice beer in the usual sense of the term. In fact, I'd describe this as a mitsne. (0.5l can.)",9
"Big creamy white head over yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Pine needle hop aroma. Taste is milky grain with a dry, pine needle hope aftertaste. Very simple, but definitely good for a non-alcoholic lager. It reminds me of Clausthaler, which also uses hops to give some taste to their non-alcohol beer. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Medium white head; yellow body with faint ongoing carbonation. Aroma of rubber and straw; very faint. Taste is resiny malts with a watery cardboard aftertaste. Not bad, but indistuinguishable from other pale lagers. (0.5l bottle.)",9
"Small white head; pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint aroma, too faint for any details to be made out. Taste is sweetish with a citric character and faint spice. Rounded and harmonic. Not much taste, but refreshing and free of any off tastes. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. No discernible aroma. Rounded, empty taste with an acidic, lemony finish. Decent, and slightly interesting, on account of the lemon. (0.5l bottle.)",9
"Small white head, clear yellow body with faint ongoing carbonation. Sweetish, buttery aroma. Watery, sweetish, faintly spicy taste. Faint apple notes. Aftertaste is bitter grain. Well. Not bad, but definitely low on taste. (0.5l bottle.)",9

"Medium white head, deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Rubbery and caramelly aroma. Taste is sweet, faint rubber, with a chalky, grainy, bitter aftertaste. Notes of caramel. Has a bit more body than the svitle/premium beers, but is still boring, even if decent. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Small white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, sweetish, rubbery aroma with notes of perfume. Taste is neutral malts, maybe some grain, with a chalky, bitter aftertaste with faint spiciness. One of the most boring beers I've ever had. Doesn't even have the distinction of sucking in an interesting way. (0.5l bottle.)",9
"Big creamy white head; clear pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light bananaish aroma with spicy citric notes. Taste is again light banana and grain with some bitterness and chalk. Dry, grassy aftertaste. A light, drinkable weizen; well made, but a bit boring. (0.5l on tap in Yalta.)",12
"Big brown head, shrinks rapidly. Deep, dark brown body. Sweetish licorice aroma with toffee and coffee notes. Taste is deep, dense coffeeish and sweet with dry, burnt aftertaste.

"No head. Served in a ceramic cup, so I have no idea about the body. Ginger-like, soda-like aroma with earthy notes. Taste is watery ginger with a dry peppery burnt aftertaste. Very light, and quite sweet. Nothing too special about this one; a light, fizzy soft drink. (0.3l of uncertain provenance.)",11
"Small white head quickly shrinks into thin white ring. Light yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish grassy aroma with apple notes. Taste is grainy apple with strong grassy notes. Some chalk. Dry, papery aftertaste. Unpleasant papery bitterness settles in the mouth. The initial taste is the best thing about this. Not so good. (0.5l bottle.)",7
"Biggish creamy white head shrinks rapidly, leaving coarse lacing. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint papery, grassy aroma. Smooth, fruity taste with hoppy grass notes and some chalk. Aftertaste is grassy bitterness and some chalk. Clean, some hops. It's OK. (0.3l on tap.)",11
"Big creamy white head over yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Faint papery aroma. Taste is watery applejuice with bitter aftertaste. Very little taste, but no off-taste. Ok. (0.5l can.)",10

"Big beige creamy head; opaque black body that's dark brown at edges. Sweet caramel pudding aroma. Taste is again caramel pudding with a faint licorice edge. No aftertaste to speak of. Not bad, but definitely boring. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Huge very light brown head over deep dark redbrown body. Sweet peppery bread and licorice aroma, faintly cloying. Taste is sweet licorice and bread with peppery notes. Watery, peppery aftertaste. Quite good. Probably my best Ukrainian beer so far. Surprisingly drinkable for so sweet a beer. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Biggish white head; yellow body with ongoing carbonation.  Dense sweetish grainy grassy aroma. Dense sweetish chalky taste with some bitterness. No real aftertaste, though chalk and bitterness linger. Nothing wrong with this, but it's not terribly interesting, either. (0.5l bottle.)",9
Biggish creamy offwhite head over yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint paper aroma. Taste is grassy malts with some salt. Aftertaste is watery bitterness. Leaves a papery taste. Boring. (0.3l on tap.),8

"Biggish creamy white head; yellow body with strong ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish grainy aroma. Taste is sweetish and grassy, with a bitter, grainy aftertaste. Some chalkiness. Alcohol not really noticeable. Very low on taste, which is disappointing in a beer this strong. (0.5l on bottle.)",9
"Medium shiny lasting white head. Cloudy yellow body with light carbonation. Thin wheaty fruity aroma with spicy banana yoghurt notes. Sweet-acidic chalky fruity wheaty taste with spicy yoghurt notes. Fullish body. Quite delicate. Chalky, smooth mouthfeel. Dry-acidic chalky herbal grassy aftertaste. Nice, very drinkable. &#40;0.5l bottle, Oslo-Kiel ferry. Rated twice.&#41;",13
"Small white head over hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faintly grassy rubbery aroma. Taste is grassy hops, primarily, followed by a mealy, papery, rubbery aftertaste. Some spice as well. Some bitterness, though not that much. More hops than the zolote, which again helps. (0.3l on tap.)",11
"Smally creamy head makes coarse lace on the glass. Body hazy pale greenish yellow (faintly darker than sribne) with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish rubbery aroma again. Sweetish mealy, grassy taste. Some bitterness and grass in the aftertaste. Mealy, but clean. Not at all bad, and quite refreshing. This one seems to have a bit more hops, which helps. (0.3l on tap.)",10
"Small white creamy head over hazy pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish rubbery aroma. Taste is spicy rubber with carbonation on the tongue. Vaguely mealy mouthfeel. Papery, rubbery aftertaste. Slight bitterness. Refreshing, but has some off taste. (0.3l on tap.)",8
Small beige head; clear dark brown body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet bready aroma with notes of watery licorice. Taste is sweet roasty malts with notes of raisins. Watery burnt aftertaste. Licorice and burnt almonds. Faint bitterness. A decent dunkel; way too watery for a proper bock. (0.1l on tap.),11
"Small white head; hazy light orange body. Bananaish milky aroma with notes of flour. Taste is banana and citrus with a dry, citric aftertaste. Sharpish, spicy edge to it. A decent weizen, if not top class. (0.1l on tap.)",11
"Small white head over faintly hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Milky, rubbery aroma with dry spices. Taste is round watery grainy malt with a milky off taste. Dryish, watery aftertaste. Didn`t like this one much. (0.1l on tap.)",7

"Huge creamy white head over hazy yellow body. Milky rubbery aroma with notes of flour. Taste is chalky and bitter. Mealy mouthfeel. No body, just sharp bitterness. Bitter aftertaste. It's drinkable, but not really very pleasant. (0.5l bottle.)",6

"Thin white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Milky, rubbery aroma wth notes of cognac. Taste is grassy with notes of rubber and wet cardboard. A bit of straw and caramel as well. Didn't really like this. (0.33l on tap.)",7
"Small creamy white head; clear yellow body. Very, very faint fruity aroma. Taste is fruity, acidic malts with harmonic grassy hops. Velvety mouthfeel. Dry, bitter, grassy aftertaste. Good session beer. (0.5l on tap.)",11

Small creamy white head over clear yellow body with a little ongoing carbonation. Very faint acidic chalky aroma. Taste is chalky bitterness with some rubber and apple. Thin and sour. Chalky bitterness with some spice lingers. Dry and tasteless; not good. (0.5l on tap.),7
"Thin white ring over deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Spicy honey vodka aroma with notes of cardamom, cloves, raisins, and bread. Sweet light honey and cardamom taste, rather like a lemonade. Spicy, dry aftertaste with notes of cloves. Interesting, and quite good, but a bit too sweet. (0.3l on tap.)",12
"Medium offwhite head; hazy dark brown body. Stale malty aroma with a touch of milk. Taste is milky wheat, very light. Lightly spicy aftertaste with a touch of bitterness. Boring, almost no taste. (0.3l on tap at the Moscow brewpub.)",9

"Small creamy white head over pale yellow body. No discernible aroma. Hoppy, clean taste with grassy hop notes and some bitterness. Watery bitterness lingers. Very mild, a bit boring. (0.3l on tap.)  Found in a John Bull pub in Moscow that listed it as &quot;John Bull Blonde&quot;, probably in an attempt to convey that it was a pale lager. It was described as a &quot;traditional British lager&quot;. Yeah, right.",9
"Medium creamy offwhite head over dark red body. Head doesn`t last. Fruity licorice aroma; faint. Soft, sweet licorice taste with peppery aftertaste. Burnt malt background. Very harmonic. Not even remotely a bitter; much more like a Czech dark. Definitely decent. (0.5l on tap at a John Bull pub in Moscow, which listed it as &quot;John Bull Bitter (brewed specially in Bedford for our pub)&quot;.)",12
"Big beige creamy head with some larger bubbles. Dark red-brown body with ongoing carbonation. Light roasty caramel malt aroma with faint hoppy background, and maybe some chocolate.

Dryish grassy herbal aftertaste with mealy notes. Decent. &#40;0.5l bottle from a street kiosk in Moscow. Rated draft in 2006, at 2.5 then, too.&#41;",9
"Big offwhite coarse head shrinks quickly. Deep greenish yellow body. Faint sweetish grassy aroma. Bitter, hoppy taste with notes of peas. Clean, and quite refreshing. A simple, straightforward pilsener. Not bad. (0.5l bottle.)",10
"Medium creamy white head with larger bubbles over light yellow body. Sweetish, grainy aroma of hay and wet paper. Taste is again sweetish grain with faint, faint bitterness. Aftertaste is very lightly dry grain and dry straw. Some emptiness to the taste. For an alcohol-free this is not at all bad. Probably the cleanest Norwegian-brewed alcohol-free I've tasted. (0.33l bottle.)",9
"Huge, rapidly shrinking, beige creamy head with many larger bubbles. Deep dark red body. Sweet spicy, licorice marzipan aroma with peppery notes and maybe some alcohol. Taste is round, sweet licorice malts with strong alcohol heat, some alcohol taste, and strong caramel. Aftertaste is almost overpowering caramel. This is too strong; it's not really very enjoyable. (0.25l bottle.) ",11
"Huge beige rapidly shrinking creamy head with holes from larger bubbles over chestnut brown body. Soft roasty malt aroma with milky licorice and bready notes. Some butter. Taste is roasty malts with a buttery background and bitter hops. The roastiness and the hops are nice, but it all drowns in the butter. Thumb's down. I didn't finish it. (0.5l bottle.) ",9
"Medium light beige head over dark red slightly hazy body. Light, spicy aroma with notes of chili, sweet caramel malts, and citrusy hops. Taste is deep, peppery, bitter malts with strong harmonious citrusy hop taste. Hard to make out the components here. Peppery, malty aftertaste with some bitterness. An excellent session beer. I'd happily drink many liters of this. (0.355l bottle, thanks to gr0ve.) ",15
"Biggish beige head; coarse on top, creamy underneath. Almost opaque black body but some dark red visible. Vanilla and light coffee aroma, somewhat one-dimensional. Taste is light coffee with some burnt toast and vanilla. A little watery. Faint acidity. Dry aftertaste with lingering burntness. Too light to be considered a real stout (more powerful than Guinness, yeah, right). They should really call it something else, like &quot;Water Porter&quot;. (0.5l on tap.)",12
"Smallish offwhite creamy head with some larger bubbles. Light brown body. Delicate flowery hop aroma well balanced with a touch of metal and very faintly roasted malt background. Taste is a harmonious blend of burnt caramel malts and flowery hops. Light, bitter aftertaste. Slight graininess in the mouthfeel. A good session beer. It's a bit watery, but the harmonic spiciness/hoppiness more than makes up for this. Definitely grew on me as I drank.  (0.5l on tap.)",14
"Medium white head over yellow body with carbonation. Light, soft malty aroma  with faint honeyish notes and light hops. Very light and mild taste with slight rubber notes. Dryish, slightly chalky aftertaste. Milder than the Mossepils. Floral hop notes with a pea-like feel. Nice, very drinkable, but perhaps a bit light for me. Must be nice in the summer, though, and probably popular with the locals. (0.5l draft.)  <p><b>Earlier rating from previous brewer:</b> Small white head. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light, acidic, rubbery aroma. Very faint. Taste is very light, almost absent. Empty, grainy taste with an aftertaste reminiscent of dry smelly socks (yes, really). Maybe a touch of raspberry. Some bitterness. Didn&#8217;t really enjoy this very much. (0.5l on tap. Scores 5/3/4/3/9.)",12
"Medium creamy offwhite head. Yellow body with carbonation. Light, clean malt aroma with floral hop notes. Dry, faintly sweetish malt taste, very clean, with honey-like notes. Dry, chalky aftertaste. A good pilsener, superior to most of the commercial Norwegian ones. (0.5l draft.)  <p><b>Old rating from previous brewer:</b> Medium creamy white head. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Acidic, spicy aroma with faint fruitiness and something herbal, like elderberry, or freshly cut grass. Taste is dominated by grass and soft bitterness, with aftertaste of peas and grain. Some graininess in mouthfeel. More body than expected. Not at all bad, has quite a bit of taste for a Norwegian pilsener. (0.5l on tap. Score: 6/3/6/4/12.)",13
"Big offwhite coarse-ish head over hazy orange body with ongoing carbonation. Deep, sweet, cookie-like malty aroma with hop notes so harmoniously blended I can't tell what the hops are like. Taste is deep, spicy malts with a deep, bitter resiny hop background. Peas, and grass as well. Bitter, resiny aftertaste. Very good, but slightly lacking in complexity. If they added just a little to this it would be an extraordinary beer. As a session beer this would be fantastic. (0.355l bottle, thanks to gr0ve.) ",16
"Small offwhite head over hazy light orange body. Aroma is spicy, grassy hops, sweetish yeast with a strange, egg-like character, wood, and a whiff of licorice and terpentine, and some alcohol. Taste is quite sharp, bitter hops, somewhat acidic, spicy wood and grainy malts. Aroma is clearly better than the taste. Somewhat disappointing mouthfeel, a bit thin and lacking in body. (0.33l bottle.) ",14
"Medium creamy white head over pale yellow body with a single trail of bubbles. Sweetish, grainy malt aroma with yeasty, rubbery notes and some metal. Taste is the same sweetish, grainy malt taste with some bitterness, and a bitter, metal rubber aftertaste. There's quite a bit of taste in this beer, but I'm not really very fond of any of the tastes, so this is not going to get top marks from me. Unusual, probably well made, but not too good. (0.45l swingtop bottle.) ",9
"Big offwhite head over deep dark brown body with some ongoing carbonation. Deep sweet aroma of malts, cinnamon, and notes of earth, chocolate, and caramel. Harmonic and good, maybe a bit cloying. Taste is sweet, spicy caramel and licorice, less cloying than the aroma. Some alcohol heat. Chocolate notes, some dryness. Quite smooth, and light without being watery. Some bitterness lingering. This is a good beer. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Small white head disappears, leaving thin film. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Strong aroma of grass and straw, very harmonic. Taste is deep, earthy vaguely metallic, again with straw and grass. Clearly a lot of hops in this. Quite unusual, but has the Einbecker signature profile. Bitterish, grassy aftertaste. A good pilsener. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Medium beige creamy head over opaque black body, with sharp dividing line between the two once the beer settles. Faint, acidic licorice aroma with burnt almond and coffee notes. Taste is balanced acidic, sweet, dominated by burnt velvety toast with a faint hop background and faint licorice notes. Not that much taste. Milky mouthfeel. Bitterish, faintly watery, burnt licorice aftertaste. (0.5l on tap.)",12
"Huge offwhite creamy head with holes after large bubbles. Body is opaque dark brown with hazy yellowish brown edges. Sweetish citric wheaty aroma with notes of coca-cola and a mix of licorice and earth. Traces of banana, too. Light, bananaish bubblegum taste, slightly tart and watery. A decent dunkelweizen, but a bit too watery and bland. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Tiny white head over deep golden body with ongoing carbonation. Wooden alcoholic aroma with buttery notes. Taste is buttery caramel with oily roasty notes. Aftertaste is lightly bitter caramel, and faint grassy notes. Buttery, medicinal taste lingers. (0.5l can.)",9
"Medium creamy white head. Hazy greenish yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Wheaty yeasty aroma with faintly acidic citric notes. Deep, tart, acidic lemon taste with a slightly mealy mouthfeel. Tart, lemony aftertaste. A nice wit; very refreshing. (0.5l on tap.)",12
"Head tries to escape out of the bottle the moment I open it. In the glass it's huge, coarse-laced, and shrinking fast. Body is opaque black, and at the edges a lighter shade of black, incredibly. Large yeast particles. Aroma is sweetish coffee and licorice. Harmonic, but not very strong. Taste is sweet coffee and licorice, with a dry, burnt aftertaste. Powerful, but still relatively light and easy to drink. Some alcohol heat is noticeable. Some acidity, a touch of chocolate, and some bitterness which is well hidden in all the rest. Quite good, definitely a decent effort. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Huge offwhite head that&#8217;s creamy on top and coarse further down.  Deep greenish yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish aroma of hay and grass. Taste is sweetish malts with notes of apple and butter, with a buttery, oily mouthfeel. Roasty caramel notes, too. Some bitterness throughout. Dry, metallic, roasty aftertaste with vague hop notes. Burnt taste lingers. It&#8217;s not really bad, but I can&#8217;t really say I like it, either. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Biggish creamy offwhite head over orange hazy body. Sweetish earthy milky caramel aroma with notes of marzipan. Taste is tart wild raspberry with vanilla and hop notes, caramel, and marzipan. Bitter almond aftertaste. A good US-style beer. (0.65l bottle.)",14
"Biggish offwhite creamy lasting head over orange body with yeast particles. Intense bready alcoholic plum and flour aroma with unidentifiable hop notes. Intense bitter sweetness marzipan malt taste with resiny, oily, alcohol, and pine needle notes. Some mint, citrus, and cocoa as well. Extreme amounts of taste. A bit overwhelming. (0.355l bottle.)",15
"Medium light beige head over deep brownish red body. Deep alcoholic bread aroma with notes of grape juice and caramel malts. Intense sweet malty grape juice taste with strong alcohol notes, plum, and complex sugars. Very complex; I think I can make out caramel, marzipan, and raspberry. Lots of alcohol heat. A bit too much alcohol, but definitely a great beer. (0.355l bottle.)",16
"Light beige head over dark red body. Burnt almond aroma with malty sweetness, caramel pudding, and dates. Deep sweet burnt almond taste with stale malts, marzipan, dates, and milk. Some bitterness. Not really that much taste. A bit disappointing. (0.355l bottle.)",13
"Medium creamy beige head over hazy dark red body. Dense aroma of wild berries and pine needles with notes of caramel pudding. Dense pine needle taste with blackberry and caramel pudding notes. Aftertaste of burnt toast and hops. It's good, but disappointing for Great Divide. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Darkish brown coarse mid-sized head over pitch black body. Milky chocolate earth aroma with a touch of caramel. Taste of alcohol with notes of chocolate, mint, and acidic burnt toast. Disappointingly little taste for an &quot;imperial&quot; porter. (0.355l bottle.)",11
"Biggish light brown head over opaque black body, dark brown at edges. Slightly acidic, soft milky burnt aroma with pine needle notes. Taste is strong pine needles and mint with acidic burnt oily aftertaste, with some ash. Didn't really care for the acidity, but otherwise good. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Medium creamy offwhite head with larger bubbles. Dark brown body with some carbonation. Roasty malt aroma and milky caramel notes with sweetish toffee and oily juniper. Taste is deep sweet malts with wild berries and roastiness and hops. Aftertaste is empty, oily burntness. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Big beige head over deep dark red body. Milky, slightly rubbery aroma with velvety, lightly roasted notes. Taste is sweetish raspberry-like roasted malt, a tad watery. Aftertaste is burnt, chalky, and somewhat bitter. Not bad, but nothing too exciting, either. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Medium white head over light hazy yellow body. Citrusy banana aroma with a touch of yeast, flour, and coriander. Taste is coriander, lemon, and some banana. Very refreshing, but not terribly interesting. (0.3l bottle.)",13
"Medium white head over hazy yellow body. Hoppy yeast oat flour malt aroma with something chocolatey at the back. Taste is big orange oat malts with a chocolatey background. Bitterish, with citric hop notes. Harmonic, even though the orange is kind of dominant. Good, interesting, unusual. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Huge light brown coarse-laced head over hazy dark brown body. Light citrusy pine hop aroma with roasty malt notes. Taste is bitter citrusy hop and roasty malts with some sweetness. Somewhat watery aftertaste. Nice, not at all bad. (0.5l bottle.)",13
"Medium offwhite creamy head over hazy lightish brown body with some carbonation. Strong citrusy hop aroma with sweetish malt nptes and hints of yeast. Bitter, citrusy taste with slightly oily mouthfeel. Surprisingly mild aftertaste. A nice pale ale. (0.5l bottle.)",15

Sweetish earthy aroma with pea-like grassy hop notes and maltiness. Sweet earthy aroma with grassy pea-like hop aftertaste. Some bitterness. A very good pilsener, and highly drinkable. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Offwhite creamy head over deep golden body. Deep earthy sweetish aroma of malts with floral hop notes and a touch of peas. Taste is deep sweetish malts with strong resiny floral hops with earthy, smoky notes and a bitter, slightly chalky aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. A very good lager. (0.5l bottle.)",14
Creamy offwhite head with some larger bubbles over deep dark red body with some ongoing carbonation. Lovely rye malt aroma with well balanced resiny hop background. Roasty malt cocoa in aroma. Deep sweet powerfully roasty chocolatey taste with resiny hop notes. Oily mouthfeel. Aftertaste is burnt and hoppy. Some alcohol heat. Excellent balance. Roasty cocoa notes. Excellent! A real star! (0.35l bottle.),17
Medium offwhite creamy head; hazy deep dark red brown body. Soft banana wheat aroma with a touch of spice. Milky vaguely bananaish taste with some wheat. Watery stale banana aftertaste. Well. It's a weizen. (0.25l on tap.),13
"Medium white creamy head; orange body with a little ongoing carbonation. Sweetish resiny hop aroma with a touch of wood. Taste is deep resin and pea hops (EKG?) with honey-like malt sweetness. Bitter all the way through. Bitter, spicy aftertaste. Well. It's not bad. (0.25l on tap.)",14
"Biggish offwhite fine-laced head over lightish brown body. Light buttery cinnamon malt aroma with a touch of smoke. Taste is watery toasty caramel malts with a touch of cardboard and cinnamon. Aftertaste is again watery. Ok, but nothing special. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Big offwhite coarse head over deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Bitterish flowery aroma with soft metal notes. Lovely sweetish caramel and nut malt taste with dry, malty aftertaste. Faint spiciness throughout, and some metal. An excellent lager. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Offwhite medium head over light hazy orange body with ongoing carbonation. Light, spicy milky wheat aroma with faint fruity notes. Light wheaty taste with some banana notes, aftertaste is light, spicy banana and wheat. A good weizen, but very light, and lacking in character. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Biggish white creamy head over yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Milky, rubbery aroma with slightly spicy notes. Taste is acidic rubber, aftertaste bitter. Didn't like this at all; way too much rubber. (0.25l on tap.)",8
"Tiny offwhite head (just a ring round the edge and thin film) over deep reddish brown body. Sweet syrupy malty marzipan aroma with sharper notes and faint, faint alcohol. Taste is intense deep sweet malts with some alcohol and citrusy hops barely detectable. Dark rye-like grain background. When it warms you can pick up the lovely cascade hops, and it improves another notch. A good barley wine. (0.1l on tap.)",15
"Medium beige creamy head over deep chestnut brown body. Burnt rubbery milky aroma with touches of caramel. Taste is banana and milky roastiness. The aftertaste is dryish milky malts. Faint licorice. Not really like a dubbel, and not too successful. (0.25l on tap.)",13
"Small white head over light brown body with ongoing carbonation. Soft, sweet citrusy malt aroma, well balanced. Caramel and soft metal notes. Taste is softly metallic stale hops with a soft bitter aftertaste. Faint caramel notes. A very mild IPA, with more Belgian-style than US-style hoppiness. (0.25l on tap.)",14
"Medium light brown fine-laced head. Deep brown body with some red, almost opaque. Deep burnt malt aroma with some sweetness and a touch of caramel. Taste is nicely balanced soft burntness with faint wood, caramel, and charcoal. Aftertaste is dry and burnt. A good schwarz. (0.25l on tap.)",14
"Very small offwhite creamy head over deep red-brown body. Sweet roasty malt aroma with faint hoppy notes and some hints of coffee. Taste is roasty malts and hops, with a bitter burnt, dry aftertaste. A bit too one-dimensional, unfortunately, but still a good beer. (0.25l on tap.)",13
Small white creamy head over clear golden body with some ongoing carbonation. Soft faintly sweetish malty aroma with floral hop notes. Reminiscent of sweet white wine. Delicious hoppy taste with subdued sweetish malts in the background; nicely bitter all the way through. Citric floral hoppy bitter aftertaste. Clean mouthfeel. One of the best pilseners I've had. (0.25l on tap.),15
Small white creamy head; yellow hazy body with a faint greenish tinge. Light milky spicy aroma with some coriander. Taste is faintly citric malts and quite spicy. Aftertaste is lightly dry. A nice with. (0.25l on tap.),14
"Head disappeared, leaving light, yellowish brown body. Light, sweetish, pea-like hop and malt aroma. Taste is sweetish malts and strong hoppy background of resin and peas (EKG?). Aftertaste is lightly dry pea hops. (0.3l on tap at Lord Nelson, CPH.)",13
"Small white fine-laced head over deep yellow hazy body with ongoing carbonation. Aroma is grain and vague citrusy hops. Taste is deep sweetish malts with watery citrusy background, slightly bitter aftertaste. A light, drinkable pale ale. (0.3l on tap.)",14
"Small creamy white head over hazy yellow body. Faintly acidic aroma of banana and citrus, and a touch of spice. Faintly watery wheaty banana taste, somewhat stale spicy aftertaste. A decent weizen. (0.1l taster on tap.)",12
"Creamy dark beige lasting head over black body with faint reddish brown at the edges. Milky roasty coffeeish sweetish aroma with notes of chocolate and caramel pudding. Taste is acidic burnt toast with hop notes, a tad chalky and watery. Burnt aftertaste. Hmmm. Was this one off, or is it meant to be acidic? Thought it a bit one-dimensional, as well. Decent. (0.1l taster on tap.)",13
"Small offwhite head and chestnut brown body with some carbonation. Sweet apricot malt aroma with light whisky notes. Taste of hops and sweetish malts, and a bitter aftertaste of roasty malts and hops. Bitter throughout. A tiny bit watery, but well balanced. (0.1l taster on tap.)",14
"Medium white head, yellow body with carbonation. Aroma of citrusy hops and something floral and tea-like. Great balance. Taste is again this floral tea-like taste with sweetish malts and a dry, bitter floral aftertaste. An excellent pale ale. Really interesting. (0.1l taster on tap.]",15
"Small white head, pale brown body with some carbonation. Caramel and cinnamon aroma, well balanced. Some fruity banana notes and faint roastiness. Watery banana caramel taste with dry cinnamon aftertaste. Nice roastiness. A decent beer, though not very like a blonde. (It was called Ete Blonde when I tried it.) (0.1l taster on tap.)",14
"No head, golden body, some carbonation. Light, clean smoky hop aroma, nicely blended and balanced. Taste is smoky, fruity malts with a dry aftertaste. Excellent balance. Really good pale ale; complex, yet highly drinkable. (0.1l taster on tap.)",15
"Smallish offwhite head. Deep copper body. Sweet fruity apricot malt aroma with resiny, peppery hop background. Taste is sweet slightly watery apricot hop malts with bitter, resiny, grapefruity, peppery hop aftertaste. Roasty malt taste lingering. An excellent IPA, but a bit too watery and lacking in aroma to deserve the name &quot;imperial&quot;. (0.65l bottle.)",16
"Smallish offwhite coarse head, deep hazy chestnut body. Dried meat and tobacco aroma with a kind of sweetish fruity background. Not quite as weird as this sounds, but definitely strange. Also other strange, unidentifiable odours. Taste is again smoked meat and faintly sweetish malt background, somewhat dry. The beer is hot (as in spicy) throughout. In fact, it made me sneeze, and the palate goes nicely warm. It's a shame palate can only be rated from 1-5. Bitter, spicy taste lingers. An excellent beer, and one of the most interesting I've ever tried. (0.65l bottle.)",17
"Biggish offwhite coarse head. Deep, ahem, golden body, some ongoing carbonation. Fruity, sweetish aroma with unidentifiable oily hop components. Some caramel malts. Powerful, sweet apricot taste with burnt almond/caramel aftertaste. Intense bitter aftertaste with strong apricot hop notes. Oily mouthfeel. An excellent imperial pilsener (the firs I've tried). (0.75l bottle.)",16
"Biggish offwhite creamy head with some larger bubbles; light brown body with ongoing carbonation. Faintly acidic grainy wet straw aroma with some wet cardboard and metal as well. Sweetish, watery, grainy taste with some cardboard, but quite clean. Aftertaste is metal and cardboard. Overall better than I expected from Grans. (0.5l can.)",7
"Small beige head quickly disappears. Deep dark red body like slightly watery red wine, with some ongoing carbonation. Deep, acidic vinous aroma of wild berries, fruit, and wine, with a sharpish edge. Deep, intensely acidic taste, again of wild berries, wine, and wood. Sharp aftertaste. Excellent! A unique beer. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Medium white head; pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweetish, faintly resiny golden hop aroma. Taste is watery chalky bitterness with a bitter, pea-like, resiny aftertaste. A bit thin, sharp and bitter, although I enjoy the extra hops. (On tap.)",13
"Medium lasting creamy white head over pale yellow faintly hazy body with ongoing carbonation. Soft, spicy banana aroma. Sweetish watery banana wheat taste with fuzzy mouthfeel. Some acidity. Faintly metallic aftertaste. A decent weizen, but a bit too watery. (On tap.)",13
"Small white head, clear yellow body. Some rising bubbles. Faintly acidic aroma of grain and apples. Clean, light taste of malts, apple juice, and a touch of grain. Dry, grainy aftertaste. Quite good for an industrial lager. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"No head. Light brownish red body with some haziness. Sweet powerfully floral malty aroma with cinnamon and caramel notes, slightly earthy. Sweet roasty licorice taste with some cinnamon. Very fruity. Intense cinnamon aftertaste. Incredibly delicate and well balanced. Not too powerful, but much better for it. Excellent! Really something special. (0.33l bottle.)",17
"Small white head over copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Sweet roasty caramel aroma with a touch of tobacco. Sweet roasty malty smoky taste. Somewhat dry, smoky, grainy aftertaste. (0.3l bottle.)",13
"Small beige head over pitch black body. Deep chocolate malt aroma with a little yeast and earth. Taste is chocolate with a faintly dry burnt malt aftertaste. A bit too much chocolate for me, but not bad. 10 out of 10 for the bottle design. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Small beige head over pitch black body. Faint raspberry and milky burnt malts, balanced in a strange but nice way. Burnt, toasty sweetish malts taste followed by sweetish raspberry and chocolate. Burnt raspberry aftertaste. Quite good, if decidedly strange. Surprised that the combination of imperial stout and berries works as well as it does. (0.355l bottle.)",14
"Very small light pinkish head over hazy light purple body. Sweet, dense natural raspberry and rhubarb aroma with some acidity. Strong raspberry metal taste with some malts and lingering bittersweetness. Somewhat watery. Lingering stale watery bitter metal raspberry taste that's really disagreeable. Aroma is really nice, taste not bad, and lingering aftertaste unpleasant. (0.355l bottle.)",13
"Small offwhite coarse head. Light copper brown body with ongoing carbonation. Earthy, port-like aroma with notes of cloth, yeast, and cream. Acidic taste of apricot, stale cloth, and port. Acidity all the way through. Creamy wood, and other strange things. Dryish, fruity aftertaste. Excellent! This was really something special. (0.355l bottle.)",15
"Small white head over hazy yellow body. Light caramelly roasty milky aroma with perfumy fruity notes, and something sharpish. Taste is yeasty, lightly roasted, slightly acidic (maybe even citric), somewhat wheaty. Hard to classify.Aftertaste is slightly dry and grainy. Quite good, and quite unusual. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Smallish offwhite creamy head with a rash of larger bubbles to one side. Yellow-brown hazy body. (The beer was transported the same day.) Milky, rubbery aroma with some sweetish malts and a touch of caramel. Taste is delicate, very lightly roasted malts with a milky, faintly yeasty background. Bringing up the rear is a slightly dry, nutty aftertaste. Some acidity to the bitterness, and in some ways reminiscent of a weizen. Drinkable, and somewhat interesting; not at all bad. (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Small white head quickly disappears almost completely. Body is very pale yellow. Sweetish, somewhat artificial aroma of dryish apple. Watery taste of dry-sweet apple with artificial notes. Not as sugary as the pear cider. Not really enjoyable, but can be endured. (0.5l can.)",7
"Small white head quickly disappears, leaving just a small ring. Body looks like water with a little splash of yellow in it. Sweet, sugary aroma of pear and alcohol with strong artificial notes. Intensely sweet, somewhat cloying, taste of watery pear and a little metal. (How can they make it too sweet and too watery at the same time?) Watery, stale pear taste lingers. Didn't like this. (0.5l can.)",5
"Small white head quickly disappears. Pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Aroma of light, refreshing apple juice and some rubber. Taste is sweetish light apple and citrus with a dry aftertaste. Quite artificial taste. Some sugar in the mouth afterwards. A bit watery. Didn't really care for this. (0.33l can.)",5
"Creamy small white had over clear light yellow body. Faint straw and rubber aroma, plus some even fainter grassy hops. Taste is straw-like malts with some maize and metal. Aftertaste is watery straw. Well, if thi is what sunshine in a can tastes like I think I prefer beer. (0.5l can.)",7
"Small white head, light yellow body with very slight ongoing carbonation. Light fruity malt aroma. Taste is acidic straw with a touch of apple and resiny, bitter aftertaste. Unusual, but not really very nice. No off taste. (0.5l can.)",8
"Medium offwhite creamy head. Bronze body. Faint sweet caramel aroma with buttery notes. Sweetish malt taste with notes of apple. Aftertaste is delicately roasty almonds, and a little grain. Some grassy hops towards the end. Quite well made, but boring. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Medium white coarse-laced head quickly disappears. Golden body. Very light apple-like aroma with traces of rubber, and some marzipan-like malts. Taste is very light marzipan malts and a light apple-like touch. Aftertaste is grain, and maybe some grassy hops. An average pilsener. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Tiny offwhite head, deep orange-brown body. Light, citrusy hop aroma with a touch of sweetish malts. Taste is deep, sweetish resiny floral citrusy hops and malts in deliciously balanced combination. Sharpish, bitter, resiny aftertaste. Excellent! Like a very good IPA. (0.355l bottle.)",15
"Medium creamy offwhite head. Chestnut brown body. Resiny floral hop aroma. Taste is sweetish smoked malts, quite mild, with a strong resiny, floral hop background. Aftertaste is sweetish smoked caramel malts. Quite good. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Small offwhite head; deep yellow body. Fine floral hoppy aroma with a touch of sweetish malts and maybe a hint of smoke. Taste is deep, resiny floral hops, somewhat dry, with a soft dry aftertaste. Good, drinkable IPA. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Big white creamy head.  Clear pale yellow body. Light floral peppery aroma with mealy notes. Dry-sweetish floral grassy herbal taste with peppery notes. Mild, soft mouthfeel with faint buttery slickness. Mid-to-light body. Dry sugary floral aftertaste with herbal papery notes. Nice, smooth, drinkable, and actually with some nice flavours. There are certainly worse summer beers out there. &#40;0.5l can, Centra Majorstuen, Oslo. Rated twice, liked it substantially better second time.&#41;",11
"Biggish fine-laced white head over deep golden body with ongoing carbonation. Sweetish malty aroma with pea-like hop notes. Sweetish malty taste with pea-like hop background. Aftertaste is dominated by the pea-like hops. More aroma hops than usual for Norwegian lagers, bonus points for that. Faintly grainy taste lingers. Good for Norwegian pilsener. (0.5l can.)",11
"Huge offwhite head over golden body. Lovely grassy malts aroma, balanced and clean. Taste is pea-like grassy hops with faintly grainy malts in the background. Smooth mouthfeel. A quite good pilsener. (0.5l can.)",12
"Beige medium head over deep dark barely translucent body, kind of like red wine. Sweet bready aroma with notes of chocolate and coffee and a touch of figs, with a little marzipan at the end. Sweet, delicate rounded taste of chocolate marzipan and a licorice aftertaste. Somewhat spicy. Smooth mouthfeel. An excellent Belgian. (0.33l bottle.)",16
"Medium white creamy head over light brown body. Milky, rubbery aroma with a hint of grass. Taste is deep sweetish malts with smoky, roasty notes and grassy, bitter aftertaste. Slightly metallic, almost nutty bitterness. Well balanced, nice. (0.44l can (it *is* stated, actually).)",12
"Biggish white fine-laced head. Golden body. Very light mealy buttery aroma. Smells more like biscuit dough than a properbeer, but not unpleasant. Taste is light grassy malts with a soft dough and spice-like taste aftertaste. Well balanced, but devoid of character. Boring, but ok. (0.5l can.)",9
"Big white fine-laced head over golden body. Very light marzipan aroma with light malts and some faint grassy hops. Milky, rubbery notes, too. Very lightly malty, milky taste with faintly grassy background. Aftertaste is milky cookies. Boring, and not really enjoyable. Surprisingly poor from Mack.",8
"Biggish white head of coarse lace over clear golden body with a single tiny rising column of bubbles. Light, grassy hop aroma with touches of apple and far at the back a little malts. Taste is grainy malts with touches of bitterness and a light grassy hop profile. Faintly chewy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with a touch of salt. Decent, but boring. (0.5l can.)",11
"Small offwhite head. Hazy dark reddish brown body. Sweet bready aroma with some perfume, maybe a touch of marzipan, maybe a little fruit. Sweetish fruity taste with some perfume. Soft coffeeish aftertaste with touches of chocolate. Delicate, but a bit too watery, I think. Again a light delicate hop touch. Not their best, I think; the wateriness sort of spoils the taste for me a bit. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Small white head. Hazy reddish brown body. Chewy marzipany perfumy aroma with hints of nougat. Hmmm. Unusual. Agree with KnutAlbert that it's hard to classify. Taste is again chewy marzipan-like with watery roasty aftertaste. Some grain as well. Light, grassy hop notes. Delicate, and easy to drink, but a bit too watery, I think. Definitely a decent effort. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Medium brown head. Opaque black body. Milky coffee aroma with licorice notes. Dense burnt coffee taste with wild berries and caramel pudding. Milky mouthfeel. Aftertaste is milky burnt wood and coffee. Smooth and dense throughout. Pine needles. This is a great beer. Balanced, complex, and interesting. I'm impressed. (0.5l on cask at Cardinal.)",17
"Deep dark red brown barely translucent body. Big beige creamy lasting head. Light sweet bready aroma. Very balanced, but not really that strong. Taste is deep, sweet, tight toffeeish licorice with spicy notes. Smooth and dense. Bitter marzipan nougat aftertaste, with bitter nougat lingering. Chewy, and yet somehow a bit watery after a while. Lovely! One of the best Nøgne Ø beers I've had. (0.5l bottle at Cardinal.)",16
"Thin white head quickly disappears. Body is hazy orange. Aroma is milky wheat with traces of citrus, some wheat, and maybe a little rubber. Taste is delicate lightly spicy citrus with light bitter milky aftertaste. Some light marzipan hovers in the background. Excellent! Refreshing, balanced, and incredibly delicate. One of the best weizens I've had. (0.33l bottle at Cardinal.)",16
"Small beige coarse-laced head over hazy dark red-brown barely translucent body. Yeasty aroma of boiled peas with notes of roastiness and cappucino. Very unusual. Taste is soft roastiness with hoppy pea-like notes and some yeast. Aftertaste is grassy hops and soft burntness. Unidentifiable spicy taste at the back, probably the juniper. Faint chocolate notes also detectable. Mouthfeel is silky. Very nice. I've no idea what beer type this is supposed to be (traditional Norwegian, what's that?), but the beer is excellent. (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Medium offwhite head. Hazy, dark orange body with yeast particles. Sweet bready, yeasty aroma with strong fruity notes (banana?) and spice. Taste is sharp, sweet licorice and spice with bitter background. Dry, light, spicy aftertaste. Spicy taste lingers. Very, very good. A world classic. (0.33 bottle.)",17
"Small white head over clear light brown body. Grainy, caramelly aroma with banana and paper notes. Taste is papery caramel. Dry grainy aftertaste, with dry metallic bitterness lingering. Unusual, but not really good enough to stand out. A bit boring. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Medium coarse shiny beige head disappears quickly. Deek dark red barely translucent body. Deep sweet earthy malty aroma with minty licorice and roasty chocolate notes. Harmonic and balanced. Taste is deep, sweet roasty malts with earthy licorice notes and some cinnamon. Dry roasty malty aftertaste with minty notes. Light-bodied, full-flavoured, balanced and harmonic. Delicate and powerful. An excellent doppelbock. (0.5l bottle.)",17
Medium white head over yellow body. Buttery aroma with some grassy hops. Strong buttery flavour with some cardboard. Lingering cardboard taste. (0.33l bottle.),5
Small white head shrinks into thin ring. Yellow body with a greenish tinge. Sugary caramel aroma with buttery notes. Taste is buttery malts with some bitterness. Dry grainy aftertaste. Stale buttery taste lingers. This is no good. (0.33l bottle.),6
"Big white creamy head shrinks rapidly into the pale yellow body. Clean sweetish malt aroma with a touch of grassy hops and apple. Taste is watery apple and faint malts. Aftertaste is watery and a bit stale. I wonder if I can taste the rice. Boring, watery, and faintly unpleasant. (0.5l can.)",9
"Biggish white head over pale yellow body with carbonation. Clean fruity malt aroma with grassy hop notes. Taste is clean grassy metallic hops with fruitym malt background. Relatively bitter. Aftertaste is dry grassy hops. One of the better pale lagers I've had. (0.35l can, titled Suntory The Premium Malt's.)",13
"Small coarse white head over light copper body with ongoing carbonation. Aroma is a combination of butter and some grassy hops. Taste is buttery malts with notes of caramel and grass. Aftertaste is watery cardboard. Some cardboard in aroma, too. This isn't really any good. (0.5l can.)",7
"Small offwhite head over light brown body. Powerful sweet cinnamon malt aroma with roasty notes and some fruitiness. Maybe a bit too sweet. Strong sweet roasty marzipan flavour with background hop bitterness. Very nice balance between the sweetness and the bitterness. A nice bock; not too exciting, but good. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Big offwhite head over clear yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Light malt aroma with soft grassy hops and faint notes of dry straw, and perhaps a little rubber at the back. Taste is bitter golden malts with grassy hop notes throughout. Aftertaste is dry with notes of grass and straw. Faintly chalky bitterness lingers. Not bad for a light alcohol; better than many pilseners I've had. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Medium offwhite head. Darkish brown body. Sweet perfumed caramel malts aroma with some pine needle hops and notes of pepper and cinnamon. Sweet, roasty taste with quite a bit of sharpish, dry hops. Some wood. Aftertaste is dry, watery wood. Quite good, if a bit sharp and odd. (0.355l can.)",13
"Small light brown head over deep dark barely translucent red body. Deep, sweet aroma of hickory, cloves, cinnamon, and some paper. Notes of licorice. Taste is dark wood, some bitterness, and the aftertaste is a mix of licorice, wood, and tar. Surprisingly tart taste compared to the sweetness of the aroma. Interesting and complex; also quite challenging because of all the spices. Very well balanced for such a spicy beer. (0.355l bottle.)",16
"Small white head quickly disappears, leaving only thin ring round the edge. Copper body, with some ongoing carbonation. Aroma is watery and unbalanced, but brings up many associations. Strong butter odour with roasty caramel notes and maybe a touch of wood and metal. It's really bad, but I'm saving the 1 in the hope that something worse will show up one day. Watery roasty caramel flavour with aftertaste of watery burnt wood and metal. Notes of butter, too. Some hops and bitterness are detectable. A really disgusting salty buttery metal taste lingers. Palate is buttery, and it feels like the beer leaves a metal butter film in your mouth. Overall, this is astonishingly bad. This is the first beer that's made me want to rinse my mouth afterwards. The initial taste isn't really as bad as the aroma, but the aftertaste is dreadful. Well. What can I say? It's kind of fun to rate, since the taste is so complex, but I would rather drink fermented well-used soccer socks, I think. (0.5l can.)",1
"Huge white coarse-laced head subsides before too long. Darkish copper body. Sugary soda-pop aroma with unbalanced dark caramel and water, plus some vaguely roasty traces and butter. There&#8217;s quite a bit of aroma, but it&#8217;s completely lacking in balance, and has too much water and sugar, not to mention butter. Taste is watery, grainy caramel with an aftertaste of caramel and straw. Notes of butter here, too, and traces of metallic bitterness. This is just very, very poor. I don&#8217;t know what this is meant to be, but as a beer it really sucks. (0.33l bottle.)",4
"Smallish white head over pale yellow body. Aroma is watery grain and some hops. Taste is watery grain with a touch of straw. So watery it's unpleasant. Aftertaste is watery, dryish grain. Really, really poor. (0.5l can.)",6
"Medium white coarse-laced head over yellow body. Sweetish aroma with notes of apple and caramel, with a completely unnecessary touch of rubber. Taste is grainy, malty apple with an aftertaste of bitter, watery wet straw. Bitter wet straw lingers. Overall it's watery. Not really very pleasant. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Smallish white head. Hazy yellow body. Milky wheat aroma with citrusy notes. Milky citric taste with wheat and yeast notes. Hoppiness throughout. Milky bitter aftertaste. A decent weizen, but could be more assertive. (0.5l bottle.)",14
"Beige big lasting head. Deep dark red body. Vague sweet roasted caramel aroma. Sweet caramel taste with some roasted almonds. Chocolate notes. Smooth, faintly chewy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter caramel. Almond bitterness lingers. Not the most complex brune, but nice. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Huge coarse white head. Deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet fruity aroma with notes of banana. Taste is sweet banana with quite a bit of bitterness. Some soft metal hops in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel. Hoppy taste lingers. Overall surprisingly hoppy. One of the least complex blondes, but still nice. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Thin dark head. Pitch black body. Soft burnt sooty aroma with coffee notes. Taste is oily burnt coffee, somewhat dryish. Good, but maybe slightly one-dimensional. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Offwhite small head. Opaque black body. Soft old hop aroma with some acidity, and very complex spices. Slightly vinuous. Massive dark oil taste with some burntness. Massive spice impact, hard to analyze. Somewhat acidic, with notes of wild berries. Aftertaste of burnt toast. Taste of burnt oil and spices lingers. Not bad, but too massive for me to enjoy. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Small white head. Deep chestnut brown body. Sweetish banana aroma with notes of wood and spices. Taste is similar, but has smoky notes and is perhaps a touch watery. Still a very good beer. (Bottle.)",16
"Offwhite big head of fine lace over deep copper tan body. Light, ripe raspberry aroma with some acidity. Taste is sweet soft raspberry taste. Maybe a bit too sweet to drink much of. Nice, smooth, and soft, though. (0.75l bottle.)",16
"Medium offwhite head. Amber body with tiny floaties and carbonation. Fantastic strawy earthy funky aroma with orangey toffee notes. Incredibly harmonic and deep. Dry-sweet earthy strawy citric taste with chocolatey toffee notes. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Mid-bodied. Amazing harmony. Dry citric strawy earthy aftertaste with toffee and resin notes. This is just great. Ridiculously drinkable, and with amazing depth. This is my second rating, and I feel I still haven't really done it justice. &#40;0.33l bottle, Vika-polet.&#41;",16
"Small dark brown head of coarse lace. Utterly opaque pitch black body. Massively sweet hickory chocolate aroma with notes of milky caramel and alcohol. Burnt toast taste with dry burnt chocolate aftertaste. Notes of wild berries. Smoothish. Sooty taste lingers. Lovely aroma, but taste is maybe somewhat lacking in complexity. Still a great beer. (0.34l bottle. 2005 vintage.)",16
Medium coarse offwhite head over deep dark red body. Sweetish earthy lightly roasted aroma. Taste is again earthy licorice with smoky roastiness. Smooth dry bitter aftertaste. Very nice. (0.5l bottle.),15
"Big, offwhite head of fine lace over opaque yellowish brown body. Grapefruity aroma with notes of yeast, and some wheaty sweetness. Taste is sweetish wheat dominated by tart grapefruit with notes of yeast, coriander, and soap. Milky, muddy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter grapefruit. Very nice! A refreshing, clean weizen. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Medium white head. Yellow body. Earthy, meaty aroma with grassy hops. Bitter malty taste of grassy, pea-like hops. Aftertaste is bitter hops with a touch of citrus and metal. Very nice. It's really the hops that do it. (0.5l bottle.)",15
Medium offwhite head shrinks quickly. Light reddish brown body. Light caramelly aroma with a touch of roastiness. Taste is again sweet caramel with roasted almonds and traces of burnt bread. Some hops and bitterness together with the roastiness in the aftertaste. Decent. (0.5l can.),14
"Big white head of very coarse lace quickly dissolves into nothing. Deep copper body. Sweet, deep fruity, malt aroma with traces of English hops. Taste is again sweet fruity malts with notes of raisins and some sharply bitter hops. Sharp, bitter aftertaste with some fruits and quite a bit of metal at the end. I generally like hops and bitterness, but here I think Mack has made the usual Norwegian mistake of using only bitter-hops and no aroma hops, which gives us lots of bitterness and none of that lovely hop aroma. A shame, because if they had used more aroma this could have been a good beer. (0.44l can. Thanks to grove for passing this on.)",12
"Big white head of fine foam over light copper body. Faint aroma of rubbery hops and hints of malty sweetness. Sweetish light malty taste with light grassy hop aftertaste. Notes of grain throughout. Faint bitterness lingers together with the grain notes. Overall the taste is clean, smooth, and not really very strong or interesting. It&#8217;s an ice beer, so this is as expected. The grain is a little unpleasant, though. (0.5l can.)",8
"Smallish brown head over opaque black body with some dark red at edges. Sweet roasted sharp almond aroma with notes of gasoline. Very sweet oily burnt malt taste with dry burnt aftertaste. Maybe slightly more watery than expected. Peppery, almost hot. Good, but a bit too dry and sharp, without offering too much in return. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Creamy light beige head with larger bubbles. Deep dark red translucent body. Vague burnt sweetish malt aroma. Taste is sweetish licorice with some roasty malts. Somewhat watery. Faint aftertaste. Decent, nothing special. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Smallish offwhite head over hazy opaque brownish red body. Strange cardamom peppery sweetish malt aroma. Taste is sweetish peppery malts with softly metallic bitter aftertaste. Very strange, very interesting, and quite good. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Biggish offwhite head over light copper body. Tight rubbery (?!?) sweetish aroma with faint roastiness. Taste is clear, sharp bitter grapefruit with some sweetness and faint, faint roasty aftertaste. Quite dry. A different and very interesting IPA. I enjoyed the sharpness of the bitterness. (0.355l bottle.)",16
Small light beige head. Translucent dark red body. Sweet caramelly aroma with notes of cream. Mild sweetish caramel taste with more creaminess. Aftertaste is vaguely roasty. Interesting! (0.275 bottle.),14
"Medium creamy beige head. Dark red barely translucent body. Cream caramel aroma with hints of roastiness in the background. Velvety, mild, roasted malt taste with hop touches. Very nice, and quite odd. (0.355l can.)",15
"Medium offwhite coarse head. Hazy opaque red-brown body. Sharpish citrusy, peppery aroma with malt sweetness and some alcohol. Sweetish malty taste dominated by grapefruit hops. Bitter throughout. Bitterness lingers. Muddy mouthfeel. A very good IPA, if not perfect. (0.5l bottle.)",16
"Medium coarse white lace over yellow body. Sweetish malty light marzipan aroma. Watery grain taste with a hint of marzipan and burntness. Thin. Lightly bitter aftertaste, with faint floral hops. Much too watery. (0.5l can.)",8
"Medium offwhite head quickly grows coarse, then shrinks. Light coppery body. Light papery fruity aroma with hoppy notes. Dry lemony papery taste with citric notes. Mid-bodied. Bitterish citric papery aftertaste. A bit bland, but does have the papery house signature, and a little character. Certainly drinkable. &#40;0.33l bottle, Xaghra Discount Supermarket, Xaghra, Gozo. Rated twice.&#41;",11
Medium white lasting head. Clear yellow body. Sweetish malty aroma with a touch of honey or grape juice. Taste is sweet malts with floral hop background. Grainy aftertaste. A bit watery. No off taste. Faint bitterness. Decent. (0.5l bottle.),10
"Small dark brown coarse head. Opaque black body. Sweetish aroma of licorice, caramel, and chocolate. Maybe a touch of berries, too. Taste is roasty caramel with burnt chocolate finish. Sweetish. Milky mouthfeel. (0.33l bottle.)",14
"Thin coarse white head over very pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Looks like a soft drink. Faint apple-like aroma. Sweetish. Taste is watery sweetish apple juice with a watery bitter finish. No off-taste, but so watery it's unpleasant anyway. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Thin white head shrinks into a thin film. Very pale yellow body with some carbonation. Watery perfumed aroma. Taste is watery, perfumed grain with a touch of chalk. Really, really. poor. (Can.)",4
"Medium-sized coarse-laced light beige head subsides quickly. Deep dark red body with ongoing carbonation. Faint caramel aroma with touches of sugar. Watery burnt taste initially, then light caramel and licorice. Faint chocolate. Faintly bitter and dry aftertaste. Ok, but way too little body. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Thin white head which completely disappears. Pale yellow body with powerful carbonation. Aroma of malts with a touch of apple. Taste is stale grain, very watery, with only a touch of bitterness. Some cardboard. Really poor. Didn't finish. (Can.)",5
"Small coarse white head quickly disappears. Very pale yellow body. Faint aroma with a touch of apple and maybe some hops. Hardly any taste. Traces of light malts. Faint, watery dryness. Stale aftertaste. (0.355l can.)",8
"Big white fine-laced head, pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Light, sweetish aroma with a touch of noble hops. Taste is light malts with nice hop background. State rice-like aftertaste, which lingers. Semi-decent, but nothing to be proud of. (0.355l can.)",9
"Small white head disappears immediately. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, light, watery malt aroma. Light watery malty taste with a touch of apple and a very light hop touch at the end. Boring, but no off taste. (0.640l bottle.)",9
"Small beige coarse(!) head quickly disappears completely. Coke-like body with ongoing carbonation. Vague, sweetish caramelly aroma. (Uh? Wasn't this supposed to be a stout?) Taste is watery sweetish faintly burnt malts. Faint sugary malts. Velvety mouthfeel. A touch of wet bread at the end. Well, this is drinkable, but more like coke than a proper stout. (0.355l can.)",5
"Small white lasting head. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint, rubbery chemical aroma. Flat taste of nothing followed by watery rice and cardboard. Stale taste lingers. Chalky mouthfeel. A touch of maize, and a bit sourish. Dreadful! A real drain-pour. Didn't finish this one. (0.355l can.)",2
"Big white creamy head shrinks rapidly into rough lace, then thin layer. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweetish, watery, sugary aroma,  reminiscent of apple juice with chemical touches. Taste is watery, grainy nothing and cardboard, with a splash of hops at the end. Chalky mouthfeel. Dreadful. (0.355l can.)",5
"Small white head quickly shrinks into thin donut shape in the middle. Yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Thin sugary aroma with notes of alcohol and gasoline, and a floral touch. Taste is reminiscent of watery apple juice with a touch of floral watery hops. Very, very faint watery bitterness at the end. Well. This is almost tasteless, and what little taste there is could definitely be improved. Thumbs down. (0.355l bottle.)",7
Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Creamy small white head. Aroma of light straw with slight malt notes. Taste is again light straw with some grain. Aftertaste has a nice faint hop profile. Traces of bitterness. Watery. Faintly sourish. Forgettable. (0.33l bottle.),11
"Light brown body, white head. Aroma of watery roasted caramel. Taste same as aroma, but with lingering honey mixed in. Decent, but not very exciting. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Medium brownish beige head. Deep red body, somewhat hazy. Roasty, burnt caramel pudding aroma with notes of citric, pine needle hops, and some lacquer and wood. Dry burnt chocolatey caramel pudding taste with bitter pine needle aftertaste. A bit thin-bodied. Some background sweetness as well. Dry aftertaste of burnt wood, citric pine needle hops with peppery, minty notes. Very nice. (0.5l bottle. Batch #211. I remember roughly the same aroma and taste from earlier batches. Rerated batch #342. Again pretty consistent with earlier tastings.)",14
"Small white head. Muddy orange body. Thin, sharp aroma of coriander, some orange, and a touch of yeast that seems to promise acidity in the taste. Hint6s of cocos. Dry citric herbal taste of coriander, yeast, and slightly mealy mouthfeel. Some sweetness as well. Mid-bodied. Aftertaste is bitter citric hops, which linger, with metallic notes. A nice wit, but could be lighter and more refreshing. (0.5l bottle. Batch #236. Rerated batch #295.)",13
"Small white head over hazy orange body. Slightly roasty caramel and grain aroma with notes of citric hops, but also pea-like hops. Dryish citric caramel taste with chalky pea-like aftertaste. Some roastiness in the back. Kind of sweetish, with a metallic quality to it. The peas and citrus linger for a long time. Nice, but not a major beer. (0.5l bottle from Centra.)",13
"Huge offwhite creamy head with some lace. Light copper body. Very little aroma. Maybe a little grain. Clean, light, malty taste, with some caramel and watery grain. Faintly grassy hop background. Aftertaste is slight bitterness with a touch of grass. A decent effort, but it's not clear why they bother. The design of the can is the most distinctive thing about this beer. (0.5l can.)",11
"Huge white creamy head with some bubbles. Lasts quite well. Very pale yellow body. Hardly any aroma, except a faint whiff of grain and some very faint hops. Taste is clean, faintly acidic malts, with traces of apple and grain. Faintly bitter, watery aftertaste. Well. It's a &quot;summer beer&quot;, and while it's not a total disgrace it's not really very exciting, either. (0.5l can.)",9
"Huge offwhite creamy head with some bubbles. Reddish chestnut brown body. Sweet, malty, peppery aroma with notes of cinnamon and chocolate. Powerful, sweet malty taste with notes of chocolate, grain, and pepper. A hint of butter as well, perhaps. Maybe a little more watery than I expected after that lovely aroma. Aftertaste is peppery, mellow bitterness. Overall a good bayer. (0.5l can.)",13
"Medium offwhite creamy head. Clear, chestnut brown body. Slightly acidic, faint aroma with nutty notes and some dark caramel. Deep, bitter taste of nutty caramel with roasty notes. Clean, fresh taste. Nutty, bitter aftertaste. A very good bitter.",14
"Creamy offwhite medium head with some lace. Faintly hazy light orange body with some ongoing carbonation. Sweetish softly metallic hop aroma with notes of rubber and pepper. Peppery, sweetish taste of malts with strong soft metallic hop background (and, again, some rubber). Aftertaste is bitter pepper. Palate is overall a bit heavy for a saison, but this is still a very good beer. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Smallish white head of coarse lace. Clear yellow body with very slight carbonation. Aroma of noble hops and apple. Clean, thin malty taste with slightly hoppy, bitter aftertaste. Noble hops stay with you all the way. Some notes of apple and grain. A decent lager. (0.5l can.)",11
"Smallish white fine-laced head over pale yellow body. Aroma of grain, rubber, and noble hops. Taste is watery, bitter grain with an aftertaste of bitter straw. Very faint sweetness. A very poor beer. (0.33l bottle.)",8
"Deep dark red body, smallish creamy offwhite head. Slightly acidic, spicy aroma. Cinnamon? Pepper? Lovely, deep, sweetish malty cinnamon taste with roasty cinnamon aftertaste. Quite complex. Roasty pepper taste lingers. An excellent bayer! Easily the best in Norway. (0.5l on tap.)",14
"Medium creamy white head with some holes. Clear yellow body. Weak, strange aroma with notes of what appears to be watered-down honey mixed with alcohol. Weak, watery faintly bitter flavour with aftertaste of sweetish honey. The faint trace of honey is really what saves this beer from being bad, but the way the honey lingers is kind of nice. Decent, I'd say. (0.5l can.) ",10
"A biggish head of coarse white rapidly-shrinking lace over a copper body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint aroma of clean malty sweetness and a hint of apples; barely detectable. The taste is clean sweetish malts with notes of apple and a faintly bitter aftertaste with the smallest hint of smoke. A true ice beer this, with hardly any taste at all. It's drinkable, but boring. (0.5l can.) ",10
"Medium fine-laced white head over clear deep yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Aroma is light clean malts and faint noble hops. Boring. Faintly bitter taste with bitter grain at the end. Some lingering grass and metal. Hardly any taste at all. Decent for a low-alcohol, but nothing I'd recommend. (0.33l bottle.)",9
"Medium creamy white head with some fine lace over thin yellow body with some onging carbonation. Light milky rubbery grain aroma with a touch of straw and perhaps some hops. Taste is light rubbery grain with notes of milk and a faint metallic bitter aftertaste. Metallic bitterness lingers. Very little taste, and what's there isn't too nice. I doubt I'll have this again. Given the choice between this and water I think I prefer water.  (0.33l bottle.)",6
"Biggish offwhite creamy head with come coarser lace. Clear deep yellow body. Sweetish malty aroma with grassy hop notes and a touch of chalk. Taste is grassy chalky malt sweetness with hoppy aftertaste. Chalky pea taste lingers. Decent, a bit different, nothing too exciting. (0.5l can.)",11
"Thin white head over clear yellow body. Sweet bready aroma with some malts. Sweet malty taste with strong noble hop presence throughout, and some bread. Sharpish, bitter aftertaste. Some chalk. Faintly oily mouthfeel. Overall quite good, but not too exciting. (0.33l bottle.)",13
"Medium white head, shrinks eventually to thin ring round edge with a drifting flake of bubbles in the middle. Clear yellow body with some occasional carbonation. Very light, cool aroma with notes of apples and milky rubber. Fresh, inoffensive aroma, but nothing much there. Light, malty taste again with hints of apple and a faintly bitter aftertaste. Some taste of coriander, rubber, and grapefruit in the bitterness, which is quite unpleasant. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery. Bitter grapefruit taste lingers. I didn't think much of this. It's mainly bitter and unpleasant. I don't imagine this will be a great seller this summer.  (0.5l can.)",8
"Medium off-white head of fine lace. Opaque black body going brown at the edge, murky. Intense, sweet, spicy, chocolate aroma with licorice, toffee, cinnamon, and who knows what else. Intensely sweet chocolate taste with lots of cinnamon and unidentifiable spices. Aftertaste is intense spice mixed with alcohol heat. (0.33l bottle.) ",17
"Creamy, white, mid-sized head over clear yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Faint, bready aroma with grassy notes, a little alcohol, and a touch of candy. Light, sweetish taste of mealy malts, somewhat watery, with grassy notes; aftertaste is a slightly chalky, faintly bitterness. Not bad, but not very remarkable, either. (0.5l bottle, five days after the best-before date.) ",11
"Huge white creamy head with some fine lace over clear yellow with ongoing carbonation. Head subsides quickly. Deep, clean, somewhat delicate aroma of old hops, light fruit, and sweetish malts with notes of banana and spices; some alcohol aroma. Light, delicate, velvety taste of sweetish malty with strong old hop overtones with faint mustiness and notes of banana. Aftertaste is old hops with a little bitterness, which lingers. An excellent trippel. Not very powerful, but delicate, balanced, and beautifully drinkable. (0.33l bottle.) ",16
"Medium beige coarse head over dark brown body that's seemingly opaque black, but through which a little light brown can be spotted at the edges. Intense, sweet licorice and anise aroma with notes of chocolate and bready yeast and a touch of vanilla. Taste is deep, intense spiciness, mostly anise and licorice, but also pepper, cinnamon, chocolate, and some burntness, and god alone knows what else. Toffee, sweetness. The aftertaste is bitter chocolate anise, with lingering anise. What can I say? This is an undying classic. (0.33l bottle.)",19
"Smallish off-white coarse-laced head, subsides quickly. Body is a handsome, dark chestnut brown. At a distance the aroma is distinctly bready, but up close it becomes a mix of sweet, spicy caramel and alcohol, with stale raisins thrown in. Sweetness is a little sickly, perhaps. Broad, deep, intensely sweet taste of spicy, burnt caramel with a lovely aftertaste of charcoal malts with a faint bitterness. A taste of dry, roasted wood lingers. An excellent barley wine. I was a bit let down by the aroma, expecting more from Nils Oscar, but the taste makes up for it. (0.33l bottle.)",15
"Big creamy head with some coarse lace in the middle over pale yellow body with a little ongoing carbonation. Faint, sweetish malty aroma with a touch of apple and alcohol. Taste is sweetish malts with slightly acidic grass and grain, and a rounded, faintly bitter aftertaste. Somewhat watery. About as middle of the road as you can get, and pretty boring, too. (0.33l bottle.)",10
"Big offwhite head over darkish red body. Sweet, fruity banana aroma with whiffs of sour licorice. Sweet, soft banana taste, followed by spicy licorice and some plum. Somewhat watery mouthfeel. Licorice, toffeeish aftertaste with hints of metal. Okay. Nothing too good or interesting. Has promise, but is too watery and weak to really make good on the promise of the aroma.  (0.33l bottle.)",12
"Smallish white head over clear golden body with some ongoing carbonation. Sweetish malty aroma with some fresh apples and a hint of rubber; some toffee as well. Watery, sourish taste with quite a bit of bitterness; some malty sweetness in the background. Chalky, watery mouthfeel. (0.5l bottle.)",8
"Big beige creamy head with some lace in it over dark red, seemingly black, body. Smoky, meaty aroma with some rubber. Sweetish, roasty malt taste, thinnish, with a lovely, velvety, sooty, burnt toast aftertaste. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Silky sootiness lingers. A very good beer. It could do with some more body, but I just love the smooth burntness. (0.5l bottle.)",15
"Smallish light beige head over cloudy dark red body. Strong, alcoholic, bready aroma with notes of licorice and soft port wine, with maybe a little chocolate. Soft, deep, licorice and bread taste with plenty of alcohol warmth. Chocolatey, yeasty notes hover. Impressively harmonic and soft, yet somehow powerful. Aftertaste just fades out. A spicy licorice taste lingers. Very little bitterness is detectable. Clearly a great beer. Think this was a new bottle.",17
"Huge head of fine white lace slowly subsides. Deep yellow body with lots of ongoing carbonation. Light, faintly malty aroma with strong pea-like, resiny hop notes. Chalky, sweetish taste of soft malts with a pea-like, resiny, bitter aftertaste. It&#8217;s a good beer, but I&#8217;m not too keen on the lack of body combined with the hop character, hence the relatively low rating. (0.5l bottle.) ",13
"Medium-sized, coarse-laced white head, subsides quickly, leaving no trace. Light copper body with ongoing carbonation. Hardly any aroma at all; a very little malty sweetness with faint traces of rubber and butter. Faintly malty taste with bitter butter and rubber. No real finish, except a yeasty taste lingering. This is just completely useless. Hardly any taste at all, and what little is there is not very pleasant. I find it hard to believe a company with all the resources Ringnes has could produce this kind of stuff. ",5
"Medium sized, coarse-laced white head over faintly hazy pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Sweetish, chalky aroma of, uh, potatoes? Maybe some notes of peas and vegetables as well. Taste is sweetish chalk and peas, with a dry, bitter finish. Some hop background throughout. Very strange. Can't say I really like it, but it's not really bad, either. (0.5l bottle.)",11
"Medium offwhite head over clear deep yellow body. Sweet malty aroma with notes of bread and alcohol and a touch of noble hops. Sweet marzipan taste with notes of grassy hops and grain. Some alcohol heat. Some butter. Decent, but nothing special. (0.33l bottle.)",11
"Smallish white head over dark orange, almost brown, hazy body. Sweet malty aroma with citrusy hops and notes of pepper. Not very strong aroma. Sweet, malty, peppery taste with a background of roastiness and distinctive citrusy hop notes throughout. Citrusy, bitter aftertaste. Bitter, resiny taste lingers. Silky mouthfeel. Slightly watery body. A good easter brew. (Batch #28 on bottle.)",14
"Medium white fine-laced head over hazy dark yellow body. Mild round wheat aroma with refreshing sourish spice notes with a hint of banana. Full, rounded wheat taste with quite refreshing spice taste. Slightly mealy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is dry spices with a touch of metal. An OK weizen, but not very remarkable. ",12
"Medium offwhite creamy head over light chestnut brown body. Light caramel aroma with notes of straw and a little hops. Nice, soft mouthfeel. Burnt, soft caramel taste, somewhat watery, with a dry, bitter aftertaste. Some hops in the background throughout. Well-made, but boring. (0.5l bottle.)",12
"Biggish white coarse-laced head over pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation and bubbles along the side of the glass. Clean, sweetish, malty aroma with notes of apple and maybe hints of marzipan. Clean, sweet taste of malt and apple, with an aftertaste of marzipan. Some bitterness throughout. Spicy, malty taste lingers. For an industrial lager this is very good. ",12
"Medium white creamy head over pale yellow body. Sourish grainy aroma with hints of rubber. Clean, sweetish taste with some malts, quite bitter, with some metal. Aftertaste spicy bitterness. A decent pilsener, mostly dominated by bitterness. Apart from the bitterness this is just an utterly normal industrial lager. Why bother importing this? (Can.)",10
"Big offwhite medium laced head over clear copper body. Acidic, fruity aroma with some hops. Clean, sweetish malty taste, softly chalky mouthfeel. Some grain in the aftertaste, and some bitterness. A decent pilsener.",12
"Enormous offwhite creamy head with some larger bubbles. Hazy amber body. Intense sweet aroma with marzipan-like notes, also some fruit and alcohol. Sweet, fruity, spicy taste with somewhat musty notes and lots of alcohol warmth. Very nice.",15
"Big beige head that&#8217;s creamy round the side and coarse-laced in the middle. Dark red body. Sweetish malty lightly roasted aroma with strong resin/pepper hop aroma. Sweet hoppy roasty taste, slightly watery, with hoppy malty, burnt aftertaste. Notes of licorice and grain. Unusual, but nice. ",14
"Biggish white coarse head over clear yellow body. Fresh, grassy aroma with hints of malty acidity. Acidic fresh taste of grassy hops and some grain; aftertaste is metallic bitterness. Metallic bitterness lingers. Decent, but a bit thin and too much metal.",10
"Small offwhite coarse-laced head over clear dark red body. Sweet, bready, marzipan-like aroma with notes of wild berries. Taste is sweet berries with some sugar. Faint maltiness with the smallest hint of roastiness. Aftertaste is sugar and faint burntness. Perhaps a touch watery. Overall a decent bock, but somewhat boring.",12
"Thin white creamy head over hazy orange-red body. Sweet bready aroma with notes of unidentifiable spice. Intense, sweet taste of cinnamon, cardamom, and coriander (I think). Aftertaste of marzipan with some bitterness and sweetness. Lingering spicy bitterness. An excellent trippel. (Why are people calling this thin and watery? I found the taste to be very strong indeed. Strange.)",16
"Medium white head over light copper body. Light, grainy, hoppy aroma with notes of metal. Light taste of grain and butter, with a bitter, metallic aftertaste. Well. Didn't really enjoy this one much. ",9
"Medium offwhite coarse head over light brown body. Sweet toffeeish aroma. Taste is very sweet and lightly roasted with a faintly bitter, nutty aftertaste. Sweetish bitterness lingers. A bit watery and lacking in complexity, but decent, even if more like a barley wine than an IPA. ",13
"Smallish white head over clear yellow body with a tiny amount of ongoing carbonation. Head rapidly shrinks into a thin film covering half the beer. Clean, acidic aroma with faint notes of apple and raisins, and a bit of water. Taste is sweetish, clean and grainy with a somewhat watery mouthfeel and a hint of straw in the finish. Somewhat bitter. Not at all bad for a Norwegian pilsener. ",11
"Huge creamy offwhite head with larger bubbles. Acidic, metallic, earthy aroma with notes of rubber that, remarkably, is appetizing and refreshing. Soft, sweetish, intensely grainy and earthy taste with strongly bitter aftertaste. Complex, somewhat harsh, but still easily drinkable. Citric background throughout. As a saison, this is almost unimprovable.",15
"Enormous dark brown creamy head with larger bubbles. Totally opaque black body. Sweetish piney resiny aroma of hickory, cork with notes of juniper. Taste is enormous, roasty pine malts and at once sweetish and acidic with notes of wild berries, tar and most other things on earth and above it; very complex. Wow! A great beer, if somewhat overpowering.",17
"Offwhite, small head. Hazy dark orange body. Sweet, broad, marzipan roasty aroma, vaguely creamy and cognac-like. Sweet, malty, roasted almonds, sugary taste with dry, bitter aftertaste. Surprisingly little aroma, which is disappointing in an IPA, but by no means a poor beer.",15
"Medium beige offwhite creamy head with larger bubbles. Dark red-brown body. Sweetish musty aroma rather like whipped cream. Sweet, smoky, lightly roasty taste with notes of licorice. Sweetish, dry aftertaste. Good, quite interesting.",14
"Medium creamy light brown head with some larger bubbles. Hazy dark brown body. Sweet, lightly roasted, oaken aroma; very harmonic, complex, and not too heavy. Intense, sweet, roasty taste initially, giving way to an explosion of hop bitterness (with little attendant aroma) that makes up the vanguard. Oaken, caramelly flavours. Sugary, creamy mouthfeel. A very cool beer, but a bit too excessive to get top scores.",17
"Smallish offwhite head rapidly disappears altogether. Lovely dark red-brown body. Fruity caramel aroma with some roastiness. Sweet, cinnamon-dominated roasty caramel taste with some hops throughout. Faint, short, bitter aftertaste. Frankly, I'm surprised at there being this much taste in a lager like this; very good.",15
"Medium white coarse head over clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Acidic, apple-like aroma with notes of straw and grain. Taste is again somewhat acidic and grassy with strong overtones of grain, ending in a spicy, bitter finish. Not at all bad for a Norwegian pilsener. ",11
"Big offwhite shiny lasting head. Yellow body. Weak fruity honey aroma. Dry-sweetish mealy fruity apple malts taste with grassy notes. Smoothish mouthfeel. Fullish body. Dry buttery honey aftertaste with mealy notes. Quite nice, but really unremarkable. &#40;0.3l bottle, Pivovarsky Klub, Prague.&#41;",12
"Small light brown creamy head, subsides quickly into thin ring. Seemingly black body, but really dark red. Sweet, perfumed roasty aroma with strong toffee notes. Extremely sweet toffee taste with roasty coffee notes. An excellent bock.",14
"Creamy off-white mid-sized head over dark red body. Sweet licorice aroma. Sweet taste of musty licorice with strong earthy notes and some metal. Metallic licorice taste lingers. Quite good, but nothing great.",13
"Huge white creamy head over hazy yellow body. Sweetish banana wheat aroma with faint hints of rubber. Sweet, milky wheat taste with banana notes. Some carbonation in the mouth. Quite good, a bit different.",12

"Big, offwhite creamy head over seemingly black, but really dark red, body. Sweetish, faintly roasty aroma. Sweetish taste of licorice and faint roastiness with faintly dry aftertaste. Nice, easily drinkable, not too exciting. Overall impression is that it's a beer with very little taste, but still not really boring. (On tap. I think this rating is attached to the right beer, but not absolutely sure. Served at &quot;Two Cats&quot; (whatever that is in Czech), which was very much a Prazdroj house. It was definitely Prazdroj, definitely dark, and definitely 12 degrees. This is the only beer that matches.)",13
"Big offwhite creamy head; dark brown almost black hazy body. Roasty, yeasty, acidic aroma. Taste is much like the aroma and a bit dry. Not really a very successful beer. (On tap.)",10
"Big, creamy white head over hazy orange body with ongoing carbonation. Aroma of faintly sweetish citric malts. Taste is again citric malts with yeast notes, some resin, and softly bitter aftertaste. Nice, easily drinkable. (On tap.)",12
"Big, creamy white head over yellow body. Rated in a very smoky Czech pub, so all I could pick up in the way of aroma was some acidity. Clean, light, faintly malty taste with a refreshing, bitter aftertaste with faint sweetness. A well-made and drinkable lager. (On tap.)",11
"Big, creamy white head over clear yellow body. Faint, clear, acidic aroma. Clean, light bitter taste with a dry finish. Clearly well made, but doesn&#8217;t really taste anything much. (On tap.)",11
"Big offwhite head over dark red body that looks opaque black. Dry, roasty, faint aroma. Dry, roasty, burnt taste with lingering sweet burntness as well as some acidity. Not as complex or as drinkable as the amber.",15

"Smallish white coarse-laced head over clear, yellow body. Grainy, straw-like aroma with some noble hops. Light, clean taste with marked bitterness and carbonation throughout, ending in spicy driness. Milky mouthfeel. Excellent for a non-alcoholic, and better than many pilseners I've had.",12
"Medium, brown creamy head over dark red almost opaque black hazy body. Sweet toffee/licorice aroma with roasty notes. Deep, sweet, complex taste of licorice and spiec with some acidity in the aftertaste. Excellent!",16

"Medium offwhite head of coarse lace over brown body. Sweet caramel malt aroma with roasted almond and toffee notes. Taste is very like the aroma with a softly bitter aftertaste. Slightly watery. Delicate, drinkable, interesting, and just plain lovely. I could happily drink a barrel of this. ",15

"Medium offwhite head over cloudy dark yellow body. Clean light aroma of floral hops. Tight, rounded sweetish malty taste with notes of grain, yeast, and strong grainy, resiny, pea-like hops. Hops very reminiscent of EKG. Dry, hoppy aftertaste. Very nice, and highly drinkable. An excellent helles.",13
"Huge offwhite creamy head; opaque black body. Thick, sweet, chocolatey aroma with spicy, resiny, tar, roasted coffee, and wild berry notes. Deep, intense taste that is very much like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the coffee and the wild berries. A fantastic porter. I believe this shows that a great porter is not made by the assertiveness of the beer (ie: dumping in heavily roasted malts), but by the balance of the beer (roastiness agains wild berries). A superb beer, one of the best I've had.",18
"Smallish, offwhite head; block, not entirely opaque body. Thick, sweetish aroma with complex chocolate, licorice, and spice notes. Deep, sweet, spicy taste with lingering sweetjess with licorice notes. Complex and interesting. A world classic. (Should probably rerate this.)",17
"Small white creamy head with islands of larger bubbles. Hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Spicy, citric aroma with fruity, bready notes and stale, metallic hops. Taste is powerfully spicy, citric banana flavours with a strong metallic hop background and earthy notes. Spicy, peppery, dry aftertaste. Fantastic! Drinkable, complex, interesting. Deservedly a world classic. (0.33l bottle.)",17
"Smallish white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Fruity wheat aroma with hop notes. Sweetish, fruity taste with apple notes and some wheat and floral hops. Soft aftertaste. A bit much carbonation. A decent kristall, but nothing exciting. Not too keen on the concept of kristall in the first place, I have to admit.",12
"Medium creamy light beige head with a rash of larger bubbles. Chestnut brown body. Sweetish malty nutty aroma with hints of smoke. Taste is again nutty and sweetish, softly bitter aftertaste. A kind of metallic taste lingers which at first I found unpleasant, but which I got used to after a while. Well. Not enough taste, very little aroma hops. This is more like a weak bitter than an IPA, IMHO.",12
"Medium beige head over dark red body that is almost opaque black. Faintly sweetish roasty aroma. Deep sweetish taste with some roastiness and burntness with toffee and hop notes. Kind of like unsweetened licorice. Dry, faintly roasty aftertaste. A nice, uncomplicated, easily drinkable schwarzbier. Could be more exciting.",13
"Biggish off-white coarse-laced head over dark red body. Soft, sweet roasty malt aroma with a touch of hops. Deep, sweet taste of smoky, roasted malts with a toffeeish, marzipany flavour combined with a very nice, grainy hop profile. Yet another excellent beer from Rogue; drinkable, interesting, harmonic. ",15
"Medium very coarse white head which subsides into a thin white ring in seconds. Faintly hazy chestnut brown body. Lovely hoppy aroma of grapefruit, grass, and peas. Sweet, smoky, malty taste with quite a bit of bitterness. Quite mild, but overall a nice, understated pale ale; very drinkable. ",14
"Big creamy very light gray head with larger bubbles, shrinking rapidly. Dark red body. Deep, sweet aroma of smoky, toffeeish malts, and some green apple. Where are the hops? Deep, smoky, sweet malty taste with smoky, bitter aftertaste, which lingers. Smokiness really dominates. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite good, but perhaps a bit too much smoke for my tastes, and not enough else. ",14
"Smallish dark beige head over seemingly opaque black body. Sweet harmonic, creamy toffee aroma with notes of piney hops and chocolate. Deep sweet roasty creamy hop taste with notes of vanilla and burnt toast. Lovely! This is just a great beer. Complex, harmonic, and well balanced. ",15
"Biggish white head of fine lace, subsides quickly. Pale yellow body. Sweetish light clean malt aroma with faint fruity spicy notes. Almost no taste at all, just faint fruitiness. In a way it's impressive that it's not watery, despite being almost devoid of taste. Faint hoppy aftertaste. Clearly extremely well made, but sadly all that skill has been expended on removing the taste rather than adding it.",8
"Smallish beige creamy head. Very dark red body. Faint sweet toffeeish aroma with notes of marzipan. Sweet, roasty toffeeish taste with syrupy burnt notes. Faintly bitter roasty aftertaste. Very clean-tasting and clearly well made. One of the better Norwegian bocks.",14
"Huge beige coarse-laced head over chestnut brown body. Aroma is a weak jumble of sweet malts and (citrusy?) hops. Deep sweet taste of roasty marzipan with a bitter hoppy aftertaste with notes of peas and resin (ie: EKG). Smoky notes. Slightly watery. Not that much taste, but definitely a decent beer. ",12
"Medium coarse-laced off-white head shrinks rapidly. Light chestnut brown body. Faint, malty aroma with notes of cardboard. Sweet taste of soft malts with buttery, sugary, cinnamon aftertaste. Watery mouthfeel. Not much taste, and what's there is vaguely unpleasant. Not recommended. ",8
"Big white coarse-laced fast-shrinking head over light copper body with occasional carbonation. Clean, sweetish apple-like aroma with very faint notes of malt. Round, clean taste of very little with appleish notes; aftertaste is bitter. Well. It's a successful ice beer, in that there is hardly any taste, and no off taste. ",11
"Small white head over copper body. Looks like your standard lager, though not too pale. Sweet malt aroma with notes of grassy hops and some fruitiness. A bit more aroma than your normal lager, and quite nice. Clean, sweet, caramelly malt taste with notes of straw, softly bitter, grassy aftertaste. Subtle, sweet, malty taste lingers. A very nice and well-made lager, with more taste than most, if not terribly exciting. ",13
"Big, creamy, off-white head; chestnut brown body. Light, malty aroma with notes of nuts and dried fruit, and perhaps a hint of smoke. Lovely, deep, sweet taste of smoky malts with notes of creamy vanilla and perfume. Aftertaste is dry and smoky. I should definitely have bought more of these.",15
"Huge offwhite fine-laced head over dark red body. Faint, sweet, roasty aroma with hop notes. Deep, sweet, harmonic taste of roasty malts with red fruit character and bitter, tarry aftertaste with sweet chocolatey taste lingering. Complex and interesting. This is a great beer!",16
"Medium offwhite creamy head with some larger bubbles; dark red body. Sweet caramel aroma with some roastiness and notes of marzipan. Taste of lightly sweet malty roastiness with faintly bitter, burnt aftertaste. Very watery. Some burntness lingers. Smells nice, but doesn't taste much. A bit of a disappointment. No off flavours, at least.",12
"Small white head, quickly shrinking to thin white ring. Light brown hazy body. Light, clean aroma of citrusy hops with sweet malty notes. Taste is bitter, sweetish malty with deep citrus/resin hop flavour. Aftertaste is bitter citrus. Bitterness lingers, with spicy notes. Oily mouthfeel. A very, very good IPA, and a quite heavy one, too. (Bottle, batch #207.)",16
"Big off-white head of cream with bigger bubbles in the middle; clear light brown body. Crisp, clean light malty aroma with a sting of citrusy, resiny hops. Taste is full and sweetly malty with a strong, hoppy citrus/aftertaste. A nice, clean, understated IPA; extremely drinkable.",15
"Big white creamy head shrinking quickly atop light yellow body. Aroma of lime and sugar; quite reminiscent of mojito, as the label says. Taste is light and metallic with strong elements of stale lime and rubber. Aftertaste is watery. Bitter aftertaste. Smells nice, but the taste isn't really very pleasant.",8
"Medium creamy white coarse-laced head with light yellow body. LIght, clean, sweetish aroma with spicy notes. Taste is sweetish and lightly malty with a dry aftertaste. Some spice and an unpleasant metallic taste lingers. Watery mouthfeel. Pretty boring, and some off taste. Not as good as the typical Asian macro lagers, and they aren&#8217;t exactly great, either. (0.5l can.)",8
"White medium-sized normal-laced head; light copper body. Light, clean floral hop aroma with faint malty notes. Bitter, floral hop taste with lovely dry, grassy hop aftertaste. Some grain/straw flavour. Metallic taste lingers. For a low alcohol this is very good.",11
"Big light tan creamy head over brownish red body. Aroma is sweet, very fruity, and somewhat peppery. Sweet, fruity taste of roasted malts, with an aftertaste dominated by cinnamon and pepper notes. Peppery cinnamon lingers. Hops can be faintly detected. This is not at all bad; probably my favourite out of the 9 new Ringnes beers.",12
"Biggish normal off-white head over dark red-brown. Watery, grainy aroma with notes of cardboard. Lots of carbonation in the mouth disturbs the taste. Taste is mostly grain and hops, with notes of cardboard and faint malty sweetness. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter and faintly spicy. Well. Not really bad, but not very good, either.",8
"Big white coarse-laced head over light yellow body. Light watery aroma of grain and straw with a touch of hops. Light, clean taste of grain with notes of straw and hops, with nicely crisp, spicy, slightly bitter aftertaste. Spicy bitterness lingers. Watery mouthfeel. Not at all bad for a low alcohol. It doesn't really have that spicy sweetness that is typical for Asian beers; it's really more like a better and more watery version of normal Munkholm. The hops are really what makes this beer.",10
"Big white fine-laced head over hazy orange body. Aroma of grass with estery banana notes. Taste has quite a bit of banana and wheat with a light, slightly bitter, spicy aftertaste. Milky, mealy mouthfeel, and somewhat watery at the end. Spicy, almost citric, aftertaste lingers. Some unidentifiable off flavours. Not bad, but not really all that great, either.",11
"Medium white head of extremely coarse lace; very pale faintly yellow body. Faint watery citric aroma with hints of grain. Metallic mint/lime taste with bitter rubbery aftertaste. Not really bad, but the lime did not appeal to me at all, and the metallic bitterness does not go well with the lime.",6
"Medium white head of coarse lace over hazy pale orange body. Strange, grassy, meaty aroma of grain and wheat with notes of spice (kumin?). Taste is like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the grass and the spice. Some bitterness in the aftertaste and more than a touch of hops. Mild, milky mouthfeel. Some spice and bitterness lingers. Somewhat bland, but refreshing and not at all bad. Lots of hops is generally a good idea in low alcohol beers, but not necessarily in a wheat beer...",9
"Small white head over hazy yellow body. Slightly acidic aroma with some notes of apple and grain. Full, refreshing taste of wheat, coriander, spice, and maybe some more apple, again somewhat acidic. Mouthfeel slightly grainy. A decent wit.",13
"Huge creamy light tan head; hazy dark red body. Sweet spicy peppery aroma. Sweet earthy taste of paradise seeds, yeast, and carbonation with peppery notes. Dry aftertaste. Nice, if not earth-shattering.",13
"Small brown head quickly disappears. Barely translucent deep dark red body. Faint fruity licorice aroma with earthy alcohol notes. Dry-sweet earthy roasty taste with plastic notes. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Light body. Dryish roasty grassy earthy aftertaste with plastic notes. Unusual, but not great. &#40;0.1l from bottle at DBF'11. Rated at 3.7 in 2006.&#41;",13
"Medium offwhite creamy head with larger bubbles. Dark red body. Deep aroma of licorice and bread and deep firm malts. Intense grainy sweet hoppy taste of corn, alcohol and caramel. Harmonic. Oily. A fantastic beer.",17
"Big white head; hazy orange body. Powerful aroma of lemon, coriander, yeast and paradise seeds and notes of bread. Soft, grainy taste of lemon and wheat with yeasty notes. Watery aftertaste. Quite good, but a bit light.",13
"Thin white head, hazy yellow body. Powerful, dense spicy lemon aroma. Thin, watery oregano yeasty taste. Watery aftertaste. Well. Give me a Hoegaarden instead!",11
"Enormous, creamy tan head. Dark red body. Sourish, spicy, unclassifiable aroma with signature de Dolle yeast profile. Deep, intense, sourish licorice taste with strong spicy notes, some cinnamon. Smooth and harmonic, clings to the inside of the mouth. A great beer!",16
"Big, creamy, offwhite long-lasting head. Hazy dark orange body. Light, clean, resiny hop aroma with malty hints. Sweetish, malty taste with strongly resiny aftertaste. Resiny pine needle taste lingering. Very nice. (On tap.)",16
"Head is thin beige ring; body deep dark brown, just barely translucent. Faint, roasty, chocolatey aroma. Soft, dry, earthy burnt taste with roasty licorice notes and chocolate. Soft, mild mouthfeel. Dry, chocolatey stale aftertaste. Nice. (0.5pt cask at Ashburnham Arms, Greenwich. Update of an earlier rating from Bishop's Arms, Gothenburg in February 2006.)",13
"Big, dark beige creamy head, opaque black body. Sweet chocolatey, roasty harmonic aroma with a touch of hops. Deep, sweet, roasty, coffeeish taste with bitter, dry aftertaste with clear hop notes. Nice, easily drinkable porter. (On tap.)",15
"Dark orange hazy body. Thin white head. Grainy, resiny hop aroma, somewhat reminiscent of Goose Island IPA. Deep, broad sweet taste of grain and grassy, resiny hops with a touch of peas. EKG? Grainy, dry aftertaste. A very nice light UK-style IPA.",15
"Small, creamy, dark brown head. Opaque black body. Deep, rounded, harmonic chocolate roasty aroma. Deep, powerful, sweetish taste of chocolate and honey, with afteratste of burnt toast and hops. Faintly sourish, probably because of the honey. Vaguely oily mouthfeel. Lovely! A great beer!",16
"Small, white head, clear yellow body. Sourish, marzipany aroma with floral hop notes. Sour, bitter taste with vague floral hop notes. Metallic sourish taste lingering. Yuck! This is awful! What's going on? Why did they make it like this? (Bought it thinking it was a UK-style bitter , only to get a rude surprise.)",7
"Big, white coarse-laced head over yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of straw. Sweet, malty, grainy taste with dry aftertaste of roasted malts. Dry, roastiness lingers. Some floral hops can be detected. A straightforward lager with some more taste than usual, plus for no off flavours.",11
"Medium offwhite head shrinks quickly into a thin ring around the side of the glass. Body is light copper, with the occasional bubble drifting upwards. Faint, sourish malt aroma. Rounded, malty taste that's quite sourish, with a bitter aftertaste with a disgusting watery strawberry-like flavour to it. Strange. The onset of the taste is nice, but the finish is awful. This product can't possibly have a future.",6
"Big, coarse-laced white head; clear, light copper body. Sourish straw aroma with hints of rubber. Sweetish, rounded taste of faint malts which goes sourish and metallic bitter in the aftertaste. Notes of straw. This one manages to be both smooth and unpleasant at the same time. That's quite a feat; not quite sure if this can is somehow gone bad. Not sure how, though. Sunlight doesn't affect cans, and exposing them to heat in Norway in January is non-trivial. (0.5l can; BBF date 2006-10-02.)",8
"Medium, white fine-laced head; dark red, almost black body. Strange, sweet aroma of ginger, gløgg (Norwegian mullet claret), and cloves. Sweet ginger taste with strong notes of cardamom, cinnamon and cloves, dry aftertaste with strong cardamom taste. In fact, a bit much cardamom in the aftertaste. This is more like a soda than a beer, but not really bad. Very different.",12
"Thin, dark brown head of coarse lace over a body so nearly opaque black that only the faintest hint of dark red comes through it at the edges. Tarry, burnt, faintly sourish aroma with hints of chocolate. Thin, sourish, burnt taste with faint hoppy notes. An OK stout, but not too interesting, a bit lacking in complexity.",12
"Huge very coarse white head, hazy brown body. Fruity, caramelly malty aroma with citrusy hop notes and some cardboard. Taste is disturbed by excessive carbonation. Taste is sourish and smoky, with a bitter, smoky aftertaste. Something ash-like in the mouthfeel. Another dud from La Barberie, I'm afraid. They must be my least-favourite brewery; good thing this was the last of the LB bottles.",9
"Medium, white, creamy head with some larger bubbles atop light brown body. Faint, mellow, fruity aroma with soapy notes. Mild, sweetish, malty taste with a nicely bitter, rounded aftertaste with notes of fruit. Mouthfeel is initially creamy, then more watery. Bitterness lingers. A decent bitter. (0.5l can.)",12
"Big, off-white, creamy head; hazy dark orange body. Sweet vinous aroma with overtones of bread, yeast, and citrus. Powerful, sweet, vinous taste of lemon and spice, with a spicy, dry aftertaste, which lingers. Noticeable alcohol warmth.  A great beer!",16
"Small white coarse-laced head shrinks to a thin white ring. Hazy light brown body. Sweet, fruity, caramelly aroma with strong citrus hop profile. Malty, bitter taste, somewhat watery. Bitterness with fruity notes lingers. A very good, and quite untypical, dark lager.",13
"Small, white head of coarse lace subsides quickly into a thin white ring. Clear yellow body. Fruity, lemony aroma with hints of coriander and perhaps some caraway.Taste is surprisingly full and malty with hints of wheat. Aftertaste is bitter. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Some off flavours. Quite unusual, OK, but not too exciting.",11
"Biggish, off-white head, creamy with some larger bubbles. Deep, dark brown body with a reddish tinge. Sourish aroma with hints of cinnamon and spices, and some caramel. Deep, sweet lager taste of cinnamon and faintly roasted malts. Quite good, but nothing exceptional.",12
"Medium, offwhite head with large bubbles. Big aroma of pine and old lemons, with overtones of spice and cedar. Bitter, sourish, watery taste of lemon. Disappointing taste, but not at all bad.",14
"Medium, tan head of large bubbles over hazy dark red body. Deep, sweet aroma of red wine, yeast, and bread with notes of alcohol and paint. Deep, extremely sweet alcohol fruity, melony taste. Intense, reminiscent of mulled red wine. Bitter, sweet aftertaste. Notes of apples. A glorious beer. (2005 bottle, drank January 2006. Have tried 7- and 13-year old bottles before, which were among my best tasting experiences ever.)",17
"Medium dark brown creamy head with larger bubbles. Utterly opaque black body. Deep, sweet aroma of burnt licorice, coffee, and wild berries, with notes of bread and oil. Very harmonic; I could just sit and smell this for ever. Deep, sweet, burnt taste of chocolate, hops, and roastiness. Burnt marzipan flavours linger. Huge amounts of hops can be detected, but they blend in nicely with the rest. Caramel, nicely, vaguely burnt. Velvety, oily, seductive mouthfeel. Mellow. Lovely! Fantastic! One of the best beers I've had.",18
"Medium, off-white, creamy head with larger bubbles. Hazy brown body. Powerful orangey, medicinal hop aroma. Bitter, meaty taste of medicine and hints of oranges with faintly roasted flavours in the background. Considerable alcohol taste in the aftertaste. Also quite a bit of sweetness. It&#8217;s good, but not great. The medicine detracts a bit from it. A very strange beer. Historically interesting. (0.5l bottle, first from the Pitfield Street shop, second time from City Beverage Co, London.)",13
"Small, white, coarse-laced white head, Clear, dark yellow body. Looks like a pilsener. Sourish, wheaty aroma with a hint of strawberries. Taste is sweet and wheaty with notes of cinnamon and a dry strawberry-like aftertaste. Very difficult to place this beer. Very unusual, and interesting, but didn't really appeal to me.  (0.33l bottle; I *think* this is the Tarwebier, but it's hard to know, since no name is given on the bottle. Wheat is listed among the ingredients, though.)",12
"Small, creamy, tan head with larger bubbles. Dark, red brown body. Burnt, sooty, sweet aroma with the smallest hint of mints and notes of smoke. Burnt, sooty taste with some sweetness and, again, smoke. Somewhat bitter. Sooty, burnt notes linger. Good, but a little one-dimensional. (0.33l bottle labeled &quot;premium dark; brewery web site indicates it's this beer.)",14
"Smallish, coarse-laced white head; clear, light brown body. Massive, caramelly marzipan aroma. (Hmmm. No hops. Strange.) Deep, very sweet taste, with sugary, oily mouthfeel, and a very subtle hop profile. Aftertaste is bitter with roasted almonds. Roasted almonds linger. Disappointing that there's so little aroma hops here. Almost like drinking a cake. Perfect with dessert. A very good beer, but not what I expected. (Beer produced April 2005, consumed December 2006. 0.33l bottle.)",16
"Smallish, light beige, normal head over chestnut brown body, vaguely hazy at the bottom of the bottle. Deep, sweet, malty aroma with caramel and cardboard notes. (Possible that the beer is a bit old.) Bitter, malty taste with roasty, hoppy aftertaste; malt somewhat toffee-like. Burnt toast lingering. Good, and interesting, but not great.",14
"Huge, coarse-laced, off-white head. Bronze body with ongoing carbonation and some bubbles. Aroma dominated by lemon with a Belgian yeast profile behind it, together with mysterious spices. Excellent aroma, and very mysterious. Taste is deep and intense, again lots of lemon, somewhat sourish and salt-like, reminiscent of soap. The lemon is a little cloying, and before we pour the yeast in the body is a bit thin. Spicy taste lingers. Actually, this is in some ways reminiscent of a lambic. Taste is a little cloying and overdone. Still, an interesting beer, quite good. (0.75l bottle.)",14
"Small, tan, normal-laced head. Opaque black body. Dense licorice aroma with faint notes of wild berries and coffee. Dense, powerful taste much like the aroma, bitter, burnt aftertaste with lingering coffee taste. Sweetish. More of a stout, IMHO, but still very good. Perhaps a bit lacking in complexity.",15
"Medium, white, coarse head. Clear copper body. Faint aroma of licorice and apples. Deep, sourish taste of again apples with notes of licorice. Quite bitter. Dry, sweetish aftertaste. Complex, yet light and refreshing. Very good!",15
"Big white fine-bubbled head, shrinks slowly over a hazy dirty yellow body. Sourish aroma of banana and apples. Sourish, deep taste of dusty grain, notes of banana, with lemony, spicy, bitter aftertaste. Round, mealy mouthfeel. Light, refreshing, and spicy with some character.",13
"Medium, light tan coarse-laced head. Reddish brown body. Sweetish, nutty aroma. Deep, sweet taste of roasty malts with a nut-like hop profile and sweet caramel taste lingering. Bitter aftertaste. Very nice session ale.",15
"Medium, light tan, creamy head. Reddish brown body. No discernible aroma. Sourish, bitter taste with smoky, roasty notes. Nutty, bitter aftertaste. Some roastiness lingers. OK session ale, somewhat lacking in character.",13
"Dark red body under a thin white ring of foam. Sweet licorice aroma with notes of anise, bread, and toffee, as well as some banana. Deep, strong, sweet taste of sourish wild berries (huh?), marzipan (just said it was sourish, didn't I?), and licorice. Aftertaste is vaguely bitter and roasty, with lingering sweetness. Some alcohol is detectable. A good dubbel, although perhaps a bit weak.",15
"Big, white, coarse head shrinks quickly, leaving thick lace. Hazy, pale yellow body. Aroma of straw and noble hops. Taste is again straw, some grain, and a nice hop profile. Aftertaste is sweetish and milky, with faint banana notes. For a low-alcohol this is not at all bad.",11
"Off-white milky medium-sized head over clear red-brown body. Weak fruity aroma with notes of apples. Taste is mild, very fruity, and quite bitter, some notes of nuts and marzipan. Aftertaste just fades away. Mouthfeel is milky. Not at all bad. I could drink lots and lots of this.",13
"Medium, white, coarse-laced head shrinks quickly into a thin foam cover on a pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Faint floral hop aroma with notes of freshly sawed wood. Taste is lots of floral hops, somewhat bitter, with the same wooden notes towards the end. Very light, and clean-tasting, and entirely dominated by the hops. Easily the best Norwegian Pilsener I&#8217;ve had. This is quite good, thanks to the hops.",12
"Small white coarse-laced head, which quickly subsides. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faintly sourish aroma, barely detectable. Faint, malty, grassy taste with metallic hops at the end. Not that much taste, but at least there's nothing off. In a word: boring.",10
"Medium, white, coarse-laced head, which quickly shrinks. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish aroma with notes of smoke (uh?!?) and vegetables. Taste is straw and strong grassy hops with fruity notes. Bitter metal aftertaste. For an industrial lager, this has some character, but it's not really that good; the hops are definitely the best part.",11
"Medium, white, coarse-laced head over clear pale yellow body. Sweetish, grassy aroma with notes of butter. Mild, malty taste with notes of grass and apple, with a faintly bitter, soft aftertaste. Not at all bad, but mostly devoid of taste, and so boring, boring, boring.",11
"Big, pink, coarse-laced head which subsides quickly. Body so hazy it's almost opaque, dark purple. Strong aroma of blueberry yoghurt and marzipan, maybe also a whiff of hops. Taste is, uh, what? It's sour and bitter, and very hoppy; this drowns out the blueberries, which you can barely taste. Really bitter, and somewhat hoppy, aftertaste. The combination of hops and blueberries is really unpleasant. Well... Without the hops this might be quite good. As it is I can't even say I enjoyed it. It's unusual, but not good.",7
"Smallish, normal-laced, tan head, which subsides quickly, leaving a thin half-ring of foam. Deep, dark, hazy red body. Relatively faint, sweet, oily aroma of roasted malts, marzipan, and faint noble hops. Sweet, hoppy taste of roasted malts. Carbonation in the mouth disturbs the tasting. Buttery mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter, roasted malts. A quite good, if somewhat watery and faint, bock. If this were more assertive it would be great.",12
"Medium white fine-laced head. Clear, pale golden body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of noble hops. Sweetish, malty taste, quite weak. Some taste of corn, and faintly of grass. Hardly any aftertaste, just a soft rounding off. A well-made, but terribly boring pilsener.",11
"Smallish white fine-laced head, subsides quickly. Clear, pale golden body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, sourish, apple-like aroma. Taste is broad and apple-like, with notes of straw. Quite bitter, with notes of noble hops. Dryish afteraste, with lingering, grassy taste. An OK pilsener, not terribly interesting. (On tap, somewhat cold.)",11
"Small, creamy, brown head. Opaque black body. Dense, sweet, harmonic aroma of licorice and coffee. Again dense, almost sourish taste of roastiness, coffee, and lingering driness with notes of wild berries. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Lingering sweetness with marzipan notes. A very good porter, reminiscent of Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, but not as good.",16
"Smallish, tan, creamy lasting head with large bubbles. Dark brown body. Faint, sweet aroma of cinnamon. Deep, sweet taste of roasty caramel malts with fruity notes, quite bitter aftertaste. Cinnamon-like bitterness lingers. Off flavours linger in the form of metallic bitterness. On tap 2006-01-16, served way too cold. (Surely this can't be retired?)",13
"Huge, creamy, white head over light brown (amber, perhaps?)  body. Sweet, malty, grainy aroma with notes of straw and fruitiness. Taste is mostly straw, with very sweet, fruity malts behind it, and a bitter aftertaste with some spice in it. Mouthfeel slightly watery. Definitely a decent beer, but not very exciting.",13
"Big, offwhite, coarse-laced head which shrinks quickly. Very faintly hazy golden body with a tiny amount of carbonation going on. Faint, sweet, apple-like aroma. Sourish, apple-like taste with faintly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel, and indeed taste, is quite watery, as like apple juice that&#8217;s been watered down a little too much. Some spice lingering in the aftertaste. Ok, quite refreshing, but nothing special, and a minus for the wateriness. ",12
"Big, tan, creamy head with fine lace in the middle. Chestnut brown body. Lovely, harmonic aroma of caramel malts with citrus/pine hops and notes of pepper. Powerful, malty taste with heavy pine/citrus hop profile. Some sweetness, quite a  lot of bitterness. Bitter, lingering aftertaste. Excellent! Probably the best bitter I've had.",17
"Medium tan fine-bubbled head; darkish brown-red body. Sweet malty aroma with fruity cinnamon notes. Sweet, mild, malty taste with cinnamon taste lingering. Somwehat watery mouthfeel, faint notes of butter and other off tastes. Aftertaste mildly dry. An OK Christmas beer.",12
"Medium, off-white head, which looks nice until the whole thing collapses into a thin white ring. Copper body. Ghastly aroma of wet cardboard, burnt rubber, and metal. Is this bottle off? Taste is like the aroma, with less emphasis on the burnt rubber. Quite bitter, although there&#8217;s no proper aftertaste. Some sweet maltiness as well. This is just incredibly poor. How can there be a market for this? I grant you most people don&#8217;t care about beer, but burnt rubber should make anyone take notice. Claims to be brewed according to the purity law, which makes the aroma and taste of this quite a feat. What do you think? Is it the malt or the hops that give us the burnt rubber taste? Or perhaps the water? Blechhh.",3
"Hardly any head; what's there is white. Light golden body. Hardly any aroma; faint traces of sweetness only. Sweet, light malty taste with nicely dry aftertaste. Some fruitiness and spice. Light, refreshing. Typical, industrial south-east Asian industrial lager.",12
"Large, white, creamy head with lacing of larger bubbles. Body is copper brown.  Aroma is very faint; some hops and butter, notes of caramel. Taste is thin and sourish with a strong metallic bitter taste of caramel and cardboard with notes of straw. Metallic bitterness lingers. Wow! This really sucks in a completely new way. I&#8217;ve never had a beer this bad before. The best I can say about it is that it could be worse.  I would definitely prefer water over this.",3
"Smallish white head of small bubbles, subsides quickly, leaving traces of lace on the glass. Body is clear brown with a red tinge. Sweet aroma of caramel with fruity and faintly roasty notes. Taste is very sweet and malty, again caramel with some roastiness. The fruity, apple-like, taste is still there, but doesn't fit in too well. Faintly bitter aftertaste, which goes slightly dry and metallic, with the dryness lingering. Had this at cellar temperature, but it's probably more harmonic at room temperature. The metallic bitterness bothers me, but otherwise it's not bad.",12
"Medium, white head of small bubbles, subsides quickly. Light copper body with occassional bubbles floating upwards. Sweet, fruity aroma with notes of alcohol and apple. Taste is very like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the apple, and the aftertaste has metallic bitterness. Very watery mouthfeel. Metallic bitterness lingers. It wasn't so bad to begin with, but as I keep drinking I like it less and less. If you want to stay slim I suggest giving up food instead of switching from real beer to this.",7
"Big, white creamy head subsides slowly, leaving stray strange lacing on the glass. Clear copper body. Harmonic aroma of straw, some caramel malts, and noble hops. The straw is quite prominent, but somehow without really being offensive. Taste is sweet straw with strong noble hop notes, and some vegetable notes. Some metal in the aftertaste, relatively bitter. For a non-alcoholic beer this is not at all bad. In fact, I quite like it. Probably the best Norwegian beer in this category, actually. Had this only lightly chilled, which is probably a good idea.",13
"Medium, white, fine-laced head over pale yellow body. Very faint aroma, in which noble hops can just be made out, together with something else that doesn't seem too promising. Taste is watery initially, but quickly develops into a quite strongly hoppy taste, with strong off flavours. Cardboard, wet straw, and bitterness can be made out. Aftertaste is bitter. The hops seem OK, maybe noble, but they drown in the off flavours. This was decidedly unpleasant.",8
"Small, white, fine-bubbled head which quickly subsides. Light chestnut brown body. Faint caramel aroma with cardboard and hop notes. Taste is mostly cardboard, with some caramel malts, and a buttery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery. Dry, empty aftertaste, with the unpleasant butter notes lingering. This is like the ghost of a Christmas beer. Quite unpleasant. Would not recommend this to anyone for anything.",8
"Medium, quickly subsiding white fine-laced head. Translucent dark red body. Floral hops aroma, with some resin. Taste is not too heavy, with a strong hop kick, very bitter. Dry, malty, hoppy aftertaste with burnt and resin notes. A bit too bitter for this little taste, I think. Not bad, but not their best. (On tap @ OMB.)",13
"Largish, creamy, off-white head which lasts forever. Body is black and only the faintest hints of red can be spotted through it. A very good-looking beer. Faint, roasty aroma. Taste is faint to begin with, then goes all coffee, burnt toast, charcoal and faint smoky notes. Very dry. Hops can be detected, but only just. Burnt flavours linger. This is more like an Irish stout than an imperial, IMHO. Anyway, a very good stout. (On tap @ OMB.)",16
"Served ice cold; had to warm it manually. Medium offwhite head; deep, dark and faintly hazy body with carbonation. Sweetish licorice aroma with metallic, resiny hops. Taste is again resiny hops followed by roasty, burnt malts. Watery mouthfeel made chewy by the carbonation. Aftertaste is powdery, dry malts and bitterness. Acidic with notes of wild berries. This is OK, but not really a Christmas beer. Taste elements are OK, but the combination is not that great. (0.5l on tap.)  (Previous rating 2006-01-11: 6/4/6/3/15. Average, creamy off-white head over hazy red translucent body. Harmonic aroma of caramel malts and floral hops with pine notes. Sweet malty flavour quickly followed by a nice, dry aftertaste that&#8217;s malty, slightly sourish, and very hoppy. Very bitter for a Christmas beer. Hoppy, dry aftertaste lingers. Quite good, and quite interesting. (On tap @ OMB.))",12
"Small creamy white head on clear copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Light, floral hoppy aroma with notes of pine. Taste is again light, and mostly floral hops, somwhat bitter, with a kind of golden sweetness to the hop taste. No real aftertaste. Not at all bad, but perhaps a little boring.  (On tap @ OMB.)",14
"Biggish light brown coarse-laced head over dark red body. Head subsides quickly. Caramel, cinnamon, and butter aroma; slightly off. Rounded, sweet, harmonic taste of roasted caramel with softly dry cinnamon aftertaste. Peppery cinnamon flavours linger. Mouthfeel vaguely buttery. Definitely tastes better than it smells. Probably the best of the Norwegian budget Christmas beers. Actually quite close to a 7 for flavour. Definitely possible to sip this and enjoy it.",14
"Big, tan, creamy fine-laced head; hazy dark red-brown body. Vague aroma of burnt caramel and bread, maybe some syrup as well. Harmonic taste of bread, paradise seeds, and some caramel. Not that much taste, really. Bitter aftertaste. Oily mouthfeel. Good, but quite boring. Had enormous expectations for this, as I'm a big GD fan. Maybe it needs to be stored for some years? If so, why make it look like a Christmas beer? Weird.",14
"0.75l bottle. Cork exploded out of the bottle, followed by foaming beer. By the time we'd poured and cleaned up the head was small and white. Hazy yellow body. Sweet banana and bubblegum aroma, with spicy notes. Taste is spicy paradise seeds and pepper with banana notes and dry noble hops. Good, but not that good.",15
"Huge, white head leaving coarse lace; deep copper body with ongoing carbonation. Deep aroma of citrusy hops (cascade?!?) and fruity yeast notes; also detectable are resin/pine notes. Bitter, malty taste with slightly oily mouthfeel. Grapefruity bitterness. Not much body. Vert good, but could do with more body. Quite refreshing. (Beginning to suspect that Biere de Garde and Saison are just not my beer styles.)",15
"Medium fine-laced light brown head over deep dark red body through which light can just barely make it. Powerful sweet aroma of molasses and syrup with notes of coffee, oil, and wild berries. Aroma also somewhat bread-like. Taste is faintly sourish molasses with notes of wild berries and burnt syrup. Aftertaste is peppery coffee with oily hop notes. Alcohol heat lingers in the mouth. This is a great beer! Like a powerful imperial stout, but with more flavour. Especially the berry-like notes really make this stand out from your normal imperial stout. How they can call this a scotch ale is beyond me.",17
"Big, fine-laced, off-white head, over hazy light red-brown body. Aroma of spice and honey with notes of pepper, earth, and caramel. Big taste with lots of spice and caramel, plus some paradise seeds, somewhat sweet, quite bitter. Rounded aftertaste. Quite good, but a bit boring for a Belgian.",15
"Coarse lace above somewhat creamy, white, medium-sized head. Clear copper body. Aroma is standard Ringnes caramel malts with some butter. Taste is buttery caramel with skunked hops (from a can!). Some bitterness, but no proper aftertaste. This is very, very poor.  Has to be one of the worst pilseners I've had. Ringnes must really hate the memory of Frydenlund.",7
"Medium-sized white head; deep copper body. Faint, fruity aroma of apple, caramel and a little noble hops. Taste is more apple with notes of grain, water, and maybe a little butter. No detectable aftertaste. A very faintly off taste with corn notes lingers. Well. Boring is the best I can say.",10
"Quickly subsiding smallish white creamy head with some larger bubbles sits over clear copper body. Faint aroma of caramel malts with some notes of butter and almond brittle. Taste is more of the same, with perhaps more focus on the almond brittle and a quite definite noble hops taste. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Slightly off aftertaste, which is somewhat bitter. Not that good, or really that bad. Boring, and faintly bad. The bad taste lingers afterwards, which lost it two points off the overall.",8
"Big, creamy, dark brown, almost black, head. Body is completely opaque, even at the edges. Dense, sweetish aroma of burnt cofee with signuature notes I recognize from other la Barberie beers. The taste is strange, sourish, smoky, and burnt, with an oddly buttery mouthfeel. Quite bitter. Aftertaste has a grapefruit-like taste. Very odd experience. Initially I didn't like it at all, then I gradually got happier with it, but towards the end I thought it absolutely vile. My conclusion is still that this is not a good beer. The best I can say is that it's definitely unusual, and clearly not boring.",7
"Big white fine-laced head, clear copper body. Soft, faintly spicy floral hop aroma. Taste is initially caramel malts, followed by floral hops and apples. Dry, papery, mealy aftertaste with a grassy bitterness is the lowest point of the beer. Not the most exciting Pilsner, but decent. (0.5l can.)",11
"Smallish, normal-laced white head, which subsides quite quickly. Pale copper body with some solitary bubbles floating upwards. Hardly any aroma; can faintly detect some caramel malts, but that's it. Very faint and watery taste; only in the aftertaste can a vague malt and hop taste be detected. Very, very boring.",10
"Big head of fine lace, pale copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Nice aroma of pine-like hops, with notes of metal and grain.  Crisp, clean taste of caramel malts; soft aftertaste of pine-like hops. Not that much taste to this one, but what there is is very clean and nice; for a Norwegian lager this is pretty good.",13
"Biggish creamy white head over pale yellow body. Acidic, refreshing aroma with fruity notes and some grain. Taste is apple-like with some light malts. Aftertaste is very light bitterness with some straw. Not at all bad; in fact, probably the best Norwegian &quot;summer beer&quot;. A decent light lager. (0.5l can.)",12
"Biggish, creamy white head with larger bubbles; very pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of apple and some noble hops. Taste is more apple, faintly sourish, and very soft aftertaste with slightly metallic hops. One of the better Norwegian pilseners.",14
"Small, white, coarse head; brown body. Faint aroma of roasty caramel and some grain. Grainy, watery taste of caramel and straw, and something else that shouldn't be there. Hardly any aftertaste. Very disappointing. A bayer should taste more than this, and the off flavour is disappointing, too.",10
"Medium, creamy, white head; light bronze body. Aroma of noble hops with notes of grain, straw, and, faintly, apple. Taste of apple and wood, with soft aftertaste of noble hops. For a Norwegian pilsener this is great.",15
"Small, tan, quickly dissipating head. Darkish red body. Light, harmonic sweet aroma with notes of cinnamon and caramel. Arojma could be stronger. Sweet cinnamon taste, with nice, lightly dry aftertaste. Faint roasted notes lingering. A nice christmas beer, if somewhat on the light side.",14
"Small tan head, dissipates quickly. Dark translucent red body. Sweet, dense aroma of caramel and notes of wild berries, with some cinnamon. Broad, very sweet taste of cinnamon and roasted malts, with some caramel. Faint, slightly dry aftertaste with lingering burnt cinnamon taste. Quite good, but perhaps a bit too sweet.",13
"Medium coarse-laced white head; clear straw-yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet aroma of wet straw and faint caramel with metallic hoppy notes. Sweet caramel straw taste; aftertaste has bitter aspects, as well as overtones of earth and metal. Not really very pleasant.",8
"No head (probably because of glass). Brown body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint aroma, hard to detect what is there. Strong taste of roasted malts, followed by powerful hop aroma. Aftertaste is dry and roasty. Not at all bad, with the hops clearly being the best part.",13
"Big beige head of coarse lace on dark red almost opaque body. Sweet harmonic coffee aroma with licorice, pepper, and pine notes. Sweet, smoky, burnt taste; aftertaste is a strange combination of driness, bitterness, soot, and coffee. Strangely thin mouthfeel. The sooty bitterness doesn't really do it for me, but definitely a quality brew.",15
"Tan, creamy head with larger bubbles, deep dark red body. Deep sweet aroma with notes of pepper and coffee and some alcohol. Lovely, sweet, firm taste of wild berries, coffee, and slight sourness. Slightly, oily mouthfeel. Fruity, dry, somewhat bitter, peppery aftertaste. Burnt flavours linger. Excellent, but could do with less of the sourness.",15
"Biggish brown head. Nearly opaque dark brown body. Roasty coffeeish aroma with hoppy oily rye notes. Dry-sweetish taste, with an acidic edge, of burnt sooty rye with vaguely citric hop notes. Very harmonic and balanced. Full-bodied. Soft mouthfeel. Dry delicate burnt aftertaste with grainy chocolatey notes. Burnt notes linger. Very, very good and highly drinkable. Grew on me as I drank. &#40;0.5l bottle, Wine monopoly, Oslo.&#41;",16
"Offwhite, coarse medium head of quickly shrinking foam over slightly hazy light red-brown body. Aroma of lightly roasted malts with notes of wood and traces of citrusy hops. Sourish, oily taste of bitterness. Not that much taste; essentially dominated by the citrusy hops. Lacking in body. Dry aftertaste. Not really up to usual NØ standard.",14
"Offwhite, creamy medium head with larger bubbles. Hazy pale orange-red body with ongoing carbonation. Eccentric aroma that is a harmonic vinuous blend of caramel and earth. Sourish metal taste with some bitterness and notes of stale hops. Slightly watery. Aftertaste simply disappears. Refreshing, but I have to admit that this is a world classic I don't really enjoy that much.",15
"Medium white head, quickly subsiding. Clear orange body. Sweet vinuous banana-like aroma with sourish lacquer notes. Taste very like the aroma, very soft. Watery mouthfeel. Faint, lingering, peppery, banana-like flavours. No real aftertaste. Good, highly drinkable, but for a Belgian-style beer not that interesting.",14
"Small, tan, creamy head; black opaque body. Faint, roasty aroma. Deep, sweet, roasty taste, leading to an aftertaste of coffee and licorice. Very harmonic and balanced; not too complex. Great!",17
"Tan creamy medium head with some larger bubbles. Black opaque body. Sweet aroma with notes of coffee. Deep, sweet taste of cocos with notes of bitter chocolate with dry cocos aftertaste. Lots of taste, but the chocolate really makes it very unpleasant for me. Really did not enjoy this, even if it has lots of taste.",8
"Medium, creamy, white head with larger bubbles. Clear brown body. Faint nutty aroma. Sweet, nutty taste with resiny, citrusy hop notes. Soft, dry aftertaste with notes of resin and pine needles. Quite drinkable, but nothing special.",13
"Medium, creamy, white head with larger bubbles over clear yellow body. Thin hop aroma. Taste of sourish malts with resiny hops and softly bitter aftertaste. Pine needles. Quite good, highly drinkable.",14
"Offwhite creamy head of medium size with larger bubbles over dark red body. Sweet aroma of anis. Sweet malty taste with overpowering cocos flavour. Quite bitter. Dry, sharp aftertaste of cocos. Interesting, but mostly a novelty beer.",13
"Medium creamy white head over light brown clear body. Aroma of citrusy pine hops so harmoniously blended with sweet caramel malts that the two can hardly be told apart. Deep, sweet, malty taste of nuts, combined with bitterness, citrus, and pine needles. Soft, bitter aftertaste. Glorious! World class! It's really the EKG hops that make this one.",16
"Thin, coarse-laced white head on light brown body. Faint sourish aroma of resin and pine and green peas. Sweetish, light, clean taste of resin and pine, with a soft, dry finish. Very drinkable, quite good. (Cask at the Britannia.)",13
"Thin, coarse-laced off-white head on dark red body. Faint sourish aroma of nuts and faint sweet roastiness. Taste is smooth, clean, nutty maltiness; quite bitter. Aftertaste is drily nutty, with hoppy bitterness lingering. Clearly a well-made beer, but rather subdued. (Cask at the Britannia.)",14
"Thin, coarse-laced head; dark brown body. Faint sourish aroma. Taste much like aroma: bitter, sourish, thin. Dry aftertaste, with lingering pine needles. Some wood. Not at all bad, but a little boring. (On cask at the Anglesea Arms.)",12
"Thin, coarse-laced head; clear brown body. No carbonation. No aroma to speak of. Soft, sourish taste of hops, dry finish. Not very remarkable. Bitterness lingers. (Cask at the Anglesea Arms.)",11
"Small, offwhite head; brown body. Nutty, earthy aroma, with sweetish malt notes. Powerfully nutty taste, quite bitter. Ends in dry, sharp aftertaste. Roasty, pine needle notes linger. Nice, although a bit one-dimensional, and perhaps a bit too agressive for the lack of complexity. (Bottle.)",14
"Tiny dark brown head; black opaque body. Smell of blueberries, burnt licorice, and sourness. Taste is like aroma, but overpowering. Sticks to the inside of the mouth. Aftertaste dry, lingering version of same. Very good, but could be more complex. (2001 vintage sampled Dec 2005.)",17
"No head; clear brown body. Strong harmonic aroma of lacquer and sherry. Strong taste of fruit, perhaps apple, and port. No aftertaste to speak of. Slight bitterness. Very nice. One to sip. (On bottle.)",15
